1,Skip it,"Mourning, killing, running from your life from your government as well as the mob family of someone you just killed, as well as having a major physical potentially life threatening ailment...add sex with a stranger that could be out to kill you - someone you are suspicious of but for some strange reason just decide to trust without thoroughly checking out (something that *really* makes no sense), and you have a plot that just does not add up. It's like her editor was on holiday and Linda stayed up too late to make a deadline. The main flaw, I think, is that the emotional life of the heroine just did not ring true. Re-read her last book instead of forking out the cash for this one."
2,"A good, detailed bio.","While it has been several years since I have read this book, I would still rate it the best bio of Madison available, especially since it is about the only one available. It is true that it can be a tough read at times; certainly not as breezy as some of the latest bios are, but compared to the ones I have read published by the American Political Biography Press this one is a picnic. Like others writing reviews here, I am attempting to read bios on all the U. S. Presidents. This is about the only one I have seen on Madison and would for that reason alone recommend it."
1,Scooby Doo on Zombie Island : Not for kids,"Great, now they've ruined another great show. The point in the classics was to find out who the fake monsters were. If your raising your kids with Jewish or Christian values don't get this one. Lots of occultic stuff here."
1,"DIRTY ""Little Black Book""","I rented this DVD to watch with my 2 daughters while my son went to watch the football play-offs with my husband and friends. It was HORRIBLE. I thought its' characters were nasty, conniving,deceitful and morally inept. It was a waste of my money and definitely my time. I am so sorry that I put my daughters through it. What a shame that Holly Hunter stooped to such a level as to playing this loathsome business woman. So, do you need to betray a friend to get ahead in the TV producing business? HORRIBLE!!!"
2,WE ALL LOVE IT!,We purchased this seat for our 7 month old son because he was growing out of his infant seat. We love this car seat so much and it was easy to put into both our cars (2005 Jetta GLI and 2003 convertable bug) Our son loves this car seat so much I am thinking about going and buying another one for my car as well because although its comfortable it is a bit big to lug back and forth between our cars. Trust me don't spend the money on a britax this one is great and half the price.
2,A Titan's Load of FUN!!!,"This is a great, I repeat GREAT game. You will get more than your moneys worth out of Age of Mythology. It's hard to master, but easy to learn! It has a bit of educational value (considering it's a flat-out war game). You can create amazing and powerful mythical creatures and heroes to help you in your battles or just create a huge army of foot soldiers and storm the castle gates. A series of fun, new scenarios and maps along with an intreiging storiline and cool characters makes this game one in a mythical million."
1,I'm sorry,"I hate to be negative but this book was terrible. I am shocked to log on and see such wonderful reviews. This book is very small and has no more information than you can find on the internet. I am a first time Beagle owner and bought this to learn more about the bread, problems and questions I've encountered in my firt weeks of ownership. After reading the whole thing, I came away with nothing new. There is a whole chapter on breeding and a pregnant Beagle but for the average owner, this is not useful. I wish I could return this book it was such a waste of money - and was only a few dollars!"
2,THIS BAND RULES,I am just listening to a few cuts off of this album and I must say that they are bad ass...you should definitely buy this CD or something because they rule!
1,Audio cutting-out...would up returning,"I didn't have an issue with the sound; when it worked, the sound was clear. I had issues with the mics cutting out -- even when I was right in front of the base. This is why I am not a fan of wireless mics because many factors can interfere with reception. Even more now that everyone & their pet seem to have a wireless device on them. But then again, this is a VHF wireless, too. I thought it sounded good, but I wound up returning it because of the unreliability."
2,Litter Free,"Small, inconspicuous. My vehicle stays litter free. I just dump it at a gas station trash bin when I fill up."
1,Boring!,Movie Sherlock Holmes was boring. It was too slow. Just could nto get into it. Never finished it. Wasted money.
1,This 1992 Book Is Hopelessly Out-of-Date,"The Internet is not even mentioned in this book. And that's where the biggest action now is, as far as personals advertising is concerned. The old print sources that are listed are for the most part not current. The advice is so elementary (don't write about sex in your first letter, don't be late for your first date, be sure to meet in a public place the first time and the like) as to be virtually useless. And finally -- let's face it -- the fact that the author has gone through hundreds of women during a period of several years and still not met his match does not speak very highly of his frequently touted ""system."" The title is catchy, though ... and the cover is nicely designed!"
1,Garbage minus the 'The',Garbage. This is just garbage. You know Hollywood has given up when they name a title the same as the original and just drop the 'The'. The first one was a piece of crap and this one is its equal if not worse. Dumb dumb dumb. Put a nail in the coffin of this dead stupid corpse PLEASE.
2,good watch,"Simple and humble piece of wrist wear. It keeps good time and is durable without being bulky. I'd recommend this watch to anyone who wants a solid, simple, inexpensive wrist watch"
2,Cheap Crossover for a sub,"This is a great product. I have an awesome old school Autotech Amp with no crossover selections, these did the trick.I actually ended up buying the 50 hertz set in the end, only because it worked best with my sub set up.Basically it restricts any frequencies that are higher than you would want going to a subwoofer, so you get bass only.Perfect fix, better than buying a $150 crossover.I will buy these again when needed...."
2,plays everything..,nice product.. sleek.. plays all kinds of cd RW .. hdmi up conversion and lots of nice features... like the eject response to be faster.. but maybe its normal as others.. like the product for its price to value :)
1,poor quality material & leaky,"My cats like the Drinkwell so decided to try the 50 oz reservoir. he plastic was low quality & similar weight to a soda bottle. When I filled it up and installed it, the seal didn't work & reservoir leaked all over & floor. Sent it back."
1,Just fast-forward past everything without Topaz,"Where have you gone, Jamie Donahue? Our nation turns it's lonely eyes to you.Woo-woo-woo..."
2,Great DVDs... but Season 1 is better,"We own most of the Season 1 DVDs and my 22 month old daughter loves watching them (she has been watching the DVDs since she was 16 months old).These DVDs (Season 2: Vols 1 to 3) are nice but repeat many of the signs from the first season DVDs. Also, the songs in the first season set of DVDs sound more catchy and original and my daughter keeps going back to them. She can pick out the DVD she wants to watch and though she does occassionally ask for these, the Season One set remains her favorite.Of course, it could well be that she starts to find it more interesting as she gets a bit older.There was a good deal available from one of the sellers ($37 for all 3 DVDs before shipping - as compared to Amazon's offer of $54 for the same thing), which also made the purchase interesting."
1,BAD - LIKE A FART,"UGLY VOICE...WHAT THE F@#K? THIS GUY SUCKS!! UGLY, BAD, SUPER UGLY SOUND LIKE THE SMELL OF A WET FART."
1,Poorly engineered product,"I rarely write reviews, but this product is so bad I felt I had to warn others away from it. Here are the problems I have had:1. The unit has a hard time recognizing standard CDs. I have to power down and up several times to get it to recognize a disk. CD compartment is clean, and I have never touched the lens. It's a good thing I don't use this as an alarm.2. The clock runs obnoxiously fast. I have to constantly reset the time. It has drifted eight minutes forward over a month on several occasions. I still cannot spot a cause.3. The sound is average, at best, and annoyingly tinny most of the time.4. At times the control buttons have become unresponsive.5. Radio tuning is quite difficult, even though I live in an area with strong signals.As a person working in a technical field, I cannot forgive the poor engineering of this product. I will be recycling it as soon as I buy a replacement."
2,reliable purchase,"I needed a book for class. This book was a edition earlier than what I needed, but that was my doing. It was in good shape and shipped in a reasonable amount of time."
1,I Can't Stand Frank Sinatra!,"I'm not a fan of Frank Sinatra! I purchased this CD because there are three songs on this CD which were performed by Gordon MacRAE during several concerts during the 1970s that I cannot get a hold of on a record or a CD! The three songs are ""My Kind Of Town&#34, ""Send In The Clowns"", and ""My Way"". Sinatra invited Gordon MacRAE onto his show back in 1952 and he told Mr. MacRAE that he was fat! That was the real reason why Sinatra's career was in the toilet in the early 1950s. He was a jealous, nasty, vicious, and stupid person for having done that to Mr. MacRAE If anyone reading this now can get any or all three songs performed by Gordon MacRAE on a CD or record I would appreciate it!"
2,The Maker's Diet,The book was received promptly and was advertised as a new book.This is an honest company. Great to deal with. Thanks.
2,Bauhaus descends upon NYC,"I had the good fortune to catch the 2nd NYC show, and had some friends that caught the first night, so I didn't think twice about ordering this video (if only to try and catch a glimpse of one of us). I was not disappointed. All the ""expected"" songs are included, as well as entertaining little tidbits thrown in between songs (interviews w/ band, fans, etc...) I especially appreciated the fact that there was lots of footage of Kevin and David J. But I feel the most impressive aspect of this tape is that it doesn't look like a normal live video. The tape often switches from color to b/w and back again in a very smooth manner. There are numerous camera angles and perfectly placed special effects. This video is nothing short of a visual feast."
1,NO GOOD,"I am a serious audiophile. I love loud and clear sound. I bought this thinking that it would have higher quality sound than the cassette adapters not to mention it would be more convenient. I was WRONG! This is a waste of money. I strongly recommend purchasing a cassette adapter as they offer a much higher quality sound. Don't even waste time thinking to buy this item. It is a total piece of [...]. In case anyone is wondering, I live in a suburb of LA and we have a ton of radio stations out here. This thing is useless anywhere near a big city. I'm not sure how it would perform in the middle of nowhere, but in my experience, it was a waste of time and money. Two days after I bought it, I returned it."
2,A wonderful read!,"Head Over Heels is just so much fun. It passes - and then some - the only test that matters to me: I couldn't wait to get back to it. I found myself thinking, while attending to life's chores, ""I wonder how Magee (the central character) is going to dance her way out of this (generally self-constructed) pickle.The characters not only have depth as individuals, but the chemistry between them is almost palpable. Every romance novel should succeed so wonderfully on this most critical element. Head Over Heels is simply a great read - I can't wait for more from this author."
2,Interesting,It was interesting to watch but I don't get the fascination with the guy. Not sure how people would and could consider him a hero. Also expensive.
2,Good one.,"Somewhere around 2 months, the baby started getting attracted by the colors and later the tactile feel of the material. But if you want to hang it to a caraway, get the other one that is longer and not wide like this one."
1,A little imcorfortable to use with IPOD Nano,"It lacks a screen where you can see the Ipod screen when starting your workout. You should set it up prior to put your Nano into it. On the other hand, it keeps very well the sweat outside."
2,"best album ever, still worth your money","This is definately green day's best album. It still posesses more of the raw punk qualities of early green day, but it more organized than slappy. Some of the best songs and lyrics on this CD. It is still worth full price, but you can probably find it cheap."
2,Great,"All three stories were great. Francis Ray's story was about Samantha Clark, a former manager of a bed and breakfast. Samantha answer an ad for a housekeeping position and never expects to find the handsome Ethan Rawlins, a man still in pain. Shirley Hailstock's story is about a woman that was hurt when her prom date stood her up. Now he has returned and she is trying to fight the attraction that still lingers. Donna Hill's story is about a radio relationship expert that has no relationship of her own, when she meets the handsome program director, will all of that change?"
1,Disappointing,"I expected much more from a Nobel deserving author. Morrison failed to grab my attention. This was my third of fourth attempt at reading this novel, and I finally finished. I loved her style and technique. I also thoroughly enjoyed the characters and imagery. But I found the plot to be quite unenjoyable. I don't think that a theme ever developed. If you want to read something by Morrison, DO NOT choose Jazz. Thus far, Song of Solomon is still my favorite. This warning comes from a Morrison fan who has also read Beloved and Sula. I decided to share this with others since so few have obviously submitted reviews. Morrison is a great authour, but Jazz is far from a great book."
2,I LOVE IT!,"It is a very fun game, party game, and you can definitely play it lots of times with friends! Cute game!Even the music is very cute!!!"
2,Great Group Fun,"The game is very true to the original password, and has provided hours of great group fun. The only problem is that some of the words are so old as to be archane. We've found some not even listed in the dictionary!"
1,One of the most expensive...and one of the worst!,"Horrible script and horrible directing (Ebert said it best: it is the first 150 minute trailer). I can almost forgive the actors except they signed up for this awful movie. The special effects and the science are terrible. Even as escapism its bad. This movie is *boring*! ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or ""Jurassic Park"" or just about ANY other movie would be more worth your time."
1,CHEATED!!,"I gave this book 1 star not for content but for misleading me. I purchased this book published by MBI publishing thinking I was getting a new title in reality all it was, was a repackaging of 3 older titles (U.S. Army Special Forces, DELTA: Americas Elite Counter terrorist Force and U.S. Elite Counter terrorist Forces. All part of the ""Power Series"") under one cover and title, now called U.S. Counter terrorist Forces. It would have been nice to have known this prior to my purchase, but the company failed to give an accurate description of the content or in particular that the content is a reissue of prior titles. This is the second time (U.S. Special Forces, this title had three older tiltes also; Airborne Rangers, U.S. Navy SEALs, and again DELTA, which now I have this title three times.) I fell for this ploy by MBI. It does not say much for me to have been taken twice, but it will not happen a third time! Ever!"
1,Case Sent Without Foam,"I ordered this expecting to the get the 1600 in black, WITH foam. I received a case without foam. When I called Adorama they said it was a mistake in the advertisement and that they didn't carry a 1600 case with foam, only without foam. Money was spent on a rush order at a different company so I could have the correct case by the time it was needed."
2,Very Good Introduction,"I like the conversational manner with which the author treats his subject. I would have liked to see more time spent on the 8051 Instruction Set but perhaps the author assumed that the reader would use the databooks (if so, he should have stated this.) This book alone does not explain the Instruction Set sufficiently. The use of a simulator is a very good idea. However, be warned that if you want to keep using the UMPS simulator after the trial period you will have to pay $650.00! This is more than most users will want to spend. My first printing has lots of annoying typos. I sincerely hope that subsequent printings will fix these. I noted 70 to 80 typos and errors."
1,Stand Up and Leave!,"I love most of the Shirley Temple movies, but this one is NOT one! Shirley temple is in this movie maybe a mere 5 minutes and then it's history for her, as she never returns. And the movie is horrible! I viewed bad acting, poor lines, and one of the dumbest of all the dancing scenes that ever hit the screen. Really, this movie had nothing to do with her. They had her in the movie for some unknown reason, one in which I can't figure out. But when she finally did appeared singing and then dancing, it was so cute, as she was younger and very talented in her role and surpassed all these silly untalented and unknown actors. Movie is not intended to be a part of ones ""Shirley Temple"" collection, you can gladly pass this one up. Very disappointed!"
1,"Sturdy, but poor design","I liked the look of this caddy and how it would hold the CPU firmly min place (I thought). Turns out that it IS sturdy, but because of a design flaw, it simply can't receive more than a couple stars from me. The rollers are held in place with wing nuts. Those wing nuts are right next to the place where the CPU sits and when the unit is tight in place they rub against the CPU and cause scraping problems. It also causes the CPU not to sit properly in the caddy. One other thing, the caddy is not long enough to allow enough of the CPU to sit in place. Oh well. I'm not returning it since I still think it basically works, but I can't recommend it."
1,Disappointing,I was quite disappointed with the performance of this game. The graphics are choppy and many of the videos are fuzzy. There are better games out there for the money. Skip this one.
2,steven who?????????,"jump rope,well what else can be said?At the tender age of 15 I bought this book from the libary and just looked at it for years and then one night out of sheer bordom i picked it up and started reading it. the opening was so graphic and intense i could not put the book down, not knowing if i was scared to goto sleep or scared i'll miss something if i closed it, many of night i just got up after reading it i went straight to work bog eyed and wondering what might happen next!!! Jump Rope is well worth a read 'cause once you have read it again and again and then invest in some more of Ruby Jean Jensens' books. Belive me"
2,One of the Greatest Books Ever,"Ms. Lackey is a phenomal writer and I believe that Magic's Price is quite possibly on of the best books I have ever read. The characters are endearing and you grow to love Vanyel, Yfandes, Savil, and even Withen throughout the Last-Herald Mage trilogy. I would also like to praise the excellent way Mercedes Lackey presents magic in her book. I have never seen such a wonderful description with such creativity and originality and she should be worshipped for that. After reading this series I have been spurred to read them all!"
2,Lauras Review!! GO ME,"well...I havent seen this movie in a while but its one of my favourite movies of all time...Its great! The songs are amazing, the graphics are remarkable and the whole movie is perfection. Tim Burton is a Genious!! I love this movie...I had it when i was little and I watched it all the time...Thats why I want the DVD"
1,long time buff of weird cinema,"This movie deserves no stars (ok, maybe one because it wasn't produced on super 8). I saw it the week it was originally released in the theaters. If it had even somewhat lived up to the hype in the trailer, it would have been a good watch. As another reviewer said, it truly is boring and forgettable. Unless I've been smoking something funny, the movie has not been re-shot and re-edited in the last decade and a half. Don't waste your loot on this one - it's not entertaining from any perspective."
1,Bad Choice for CD Rom Cook Book,"Overall a bad choice for a PC based cook book. I ordered this book specifically for the CD Rom. I have an older copy of the cook book and didn't really need another copy. The CD Rom is not for the faint hearted. It is very difficult to use. It requires you to insert to CD Rom every time you use it. It takes control of the pc--i.e., you don't have use of the Start Menu Bar to transfer to different software programs; and the exiting of the program takes ""forever"". I had hoped to use the ""Add your own recipe section"", but this again is too time consumming to use."
2,A pleasant and fun-to-read novel,"Dooly's novel, ""His Brother's Castoff"" is a pleasant read and has a great cast of characters that will keep you turning pages until the very end. But be warned: reading this novel will compel you to buy up all the author's other books in this series!"
1,the worst game I ever bought,"this game is a lemon, I can't believe I wasted my hard earned money on such trash."
2,Polk Audio DB5251,"The performance VS cost of these speakers is hard to beat! Very smooth and balanced sound at a very affordable price! They are marine rated - a big plus especially if you intend to mount these in car doors where moisture is bound to exist! The woofers feature rubber surrounds so you know they're going to last more than a few hot, summer seasons. The tweeters are natural sounding (not shrill or overly bright) and they can be mounted in a variety of ways to accommodate your needs. Highly recommended!!!"
1,Everything falls out!,"My three year old son wanted a case for all of his cars, and although this case holds a lot it is very difficult to use. He has a hard time opening and closing the case and the plastic road pad came off almost immediately. The cars also fall out when you wheel the case around and then open it again. I think he finds it very frustrating, but he does seem to enjoy putting the cars in and out. I'm looking for a better case."
1,Disappointed,"If you live in an urban area, be careful about purchasing this. My unit works well at times but there's lots of interference. I get about 40% good reception. The other 60% is cutting out due to interference from cell phones. microwaves, etc. beyond my control."
1,"Oh, come now","The number of four and five star reviews is disproportionate here. There's a reason that most Beck fans don't count this as one of his ""real"" albums. It doesn't even deserve the adjective ""experimental,"" since that would imply that this is some kind of serious effort. It isn't.I gave it two stars because two songs amused me. (Watch the video for ""Satan Gave Me a Taco"" on Youtube.)"
2,"Perfect stand, I wish it would be a littler higher though","It work perfectly well with my Meteor mic, the only thing that I dislike is that it's too short. 5 inches higher would be perfect for me."
1,Waste of time and money,"If you enjoy doing tedious tasks after installing a huge application, that lags horribly and sucks up a large amount of system resources, then by all means, this game is for you. Please do not waste your time and money with this game.If you want to know the specs of the computers I played it on, in case you think my boxes were slow, well here they are:note: All boxes were tweaked to give the best performance, and each experienced great slow downs when there were more then 13 people in a house.box #1Windows XPp4 2.8ghz60gig 72000 rpm hd with a 2meg cache (ata 133)radeon 7500T3 internet connection with bandwidth prioritybox #2Windows 2000duron 1.2ghz40gig 7200 rpm hd with a 2meg cache udma 66gainward geforce4 ti 4400 overclocked to be faster then a 4600cable modembox #3 (laptop)Windows XP800mhz p330gig 5400 rpm hdon board 11meg video card"
1,Hylian Shield from Zelda,DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM RED DRAGON SWORDS -- THEY ARE A RIP-OFF!!!!!! THEY TAKE YOUR $$$ AND NEVER SEND YOU THE ITEM!!! I ORDERED A SHIELD FROM CHRISTMAS AND NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM AFTER REPEATED CONTACTS TO THEM BUT THEY KEPT MY $96.32 WITHOUT QUESTION!!!! DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Ack!,"Bought it; was completely happy and overjoyed that it worked perfectly--- several months passed and ""zap"". It suddenly died. Not so happy anymore."
2,"Marvelous, Simply Marvelous","The book is written clearly and, refreshingly, not from the typical left-liberal perspective so common among academics today. This should be mandatory reading in American History courses, if for no other reason than to make up for the overwhelming liberal bias in the historiography."
2,I can't stand Jim Carrey!,"Never was a fan of Ace Ventura or the Mask. A bit too silly for me. I was skeptical of this Carrey vehicle only to find out that it's not. This movie is way more clever and funny then it was given credit for, this is a nice departure for Carrey and it's almost always (Godzilla 97 excepted) good to see Broderick in anything. If you don't usually like Carrey, give this one a try, it may surprise you."
2,"Interesting, but a tad slow","The series is great, but this book is lacking something, ah yes, a good main character. After Rand being almost completely cut out of third book, he is reintroduced but lacks the appeal the pre-Dragon Reborn Rand had. He has become a cackling madman, who no longer needs to be the center of the story.But what saves this book is the character sub-plots, and new and old characters. What saddens me though is that at the end the sub-plots did not ravel together for a spectacular finale, as did the first three. And Nynaeve is becoming feminism personified. She was my favorite before she met the Aes Sedai and began her transformation in personality. Jordan you need to tone her down a bit!Overall a great book, and everyone needs to read it."
2,Behind Enemy Lines is an excellent read,I hadn't expected this book to be as interesting as it was. I had difficulty putting it down. It is the story of a young Jewish woman in occupied France during WW II. Her efforts during the war to save her family and spy for the French resistance are thrilling and awe inspiring. It is amazing how ordinary people can do extraordinary things when faced with life threatening challenges. Her courage was so admirable.
2,"Not genius, but close.","Brian Talbot's step-by-step strategy for tackling logic games is helpful, but his dislike for making deductions from rules takes away an important weapon from the logic game arsenal. Taken with a grain of salt, however, the book provides insight into logic game structure and a good approach to tackle even the strangest games."
1,Not compatible with all devices,Not compatible with my Sony MP3 player NWZ-B105F.Compatible for charging my Alcatel GSM.
1,the title was better than the read,I was expecting something out of the ordinary however I didn't get it. The book seems like it was written to make money and not to do anything in particular. Don't even buy this book
1,This has the best plot out of all of the new generation seri,"I think that this is a minor improvement. i know that it is hard to write books as i have written two and am halfway through another. sometimes the words flow like a river does but other times it takes you five hours to write a paragraph and then you delete it and start again. but these writers are writing from the part of their brain that doesn't do any work. the plots were getting worse until now. i got christina's courage and dumped it in the bin after i read it. don't pay out Joanna, she hasn't had anything to do with the change in the series,in fact she was surprised when they came out like this. Don't pay her out and hop[e for the best."
1,Remember the Commador Vic 20?,This toy looks like it was created in the 70's or 80's. I thought it would be cute for my daughter (age 5) but she kept saying that it looked like our neighbor's baby monitor and she is a 'big girl now.' We returned it because it did not captivate her interest. This may be fun for pre-k or younger but a karaoke machine or CD player would be a better choice.
1,This movie sucks Hairiness!!!!!!!!!,"it sucked! all of it! it was retarded, not even x men esque i would rather watch money burn then buy this garbage. Go buy district 9."
1,Be Very Careful Ordering This,"I needed a complete alternator, as in with pulley and this was one of the only ones that did not specify a pulley swap is needed and shows a pulley in the advertisement. Like burger king you don't get served an item like you see in the picture. Regardless of the item being functional (or not since I cannot use it until I find a pulley) one star for the extra hoops I have to jump through to make this work."
2,Does what its supposed to do,While the fan is a little on the loud side (I tend to keep it on high) I couldn't be more happy with it. The temperature in my room is very noticeable cooler and putting the parts together was very simple.
1,Plastic gears are the Achilles Heel,"The sprinkler is so great the first few days. Then the inner gears break. If it just had metal gears, this would be great. I posted some pictures of the problem weak area. Keep looking for a better idea..."
1,Rather Weak,"While this book was a page-turner, and Grisham's style of writing is eminently readable, this book lacks depth. As with other Grisham novels, you're constantly waiting for the surprises and twists, but few arrive. The end of the story is lackluster as well, leaving the reader with a somewhat empty feeling.This book appears to have been written in relatively short order and without much forethought, resulting in one of Grisham's poorest efforts to date."
2,Not a fan,I purchased the kindle version from Amazon. I rooted against the Celtics during the period covered in the book. Rooting for them would be like rooting for the Yankees. I did admire the talent on the team and respected them. I remember the players well and enjoyed the book very much. I would recommend it to anyone who followed the NBA during that period.
1,Ripoff,"I'll buy it used on eBay- They're apparantly using syndicated prints of theses shows, although no one has listed the source for that info. I'll buy it and time and then re-review this."
2,a crowd pleaser and an outstanding performance by the ever lovable Aaron Eckhart,"A charming comedy about a loser who finds himself in his struggle to remain himself. Aaron Eckhart is simply irresistible - if you haven't liked him by now, you certainly will after watching this little gem."
2,"Easy read, good advice","I haven't read the entire book, but from what I have read I agree with about 95% percent of all of Dr. Habib's statements, stories, and conclusions. There is something about reading about the experiences of others that makes a book so much easier to read than just giving us theories and steps to reproduce. Other people's lives are like parables for our own.The advice Dr. Habib provides in marriage and family is so relevant, but unheard in today's word of failed marriages or just plain unhappy ones. Life at home can be a joy, and this book can help!"
2,Cutting board,Great product. Exactly what I wanted. will order more when I want different scenes... Looks great in my kitchen..thanks again
1,Understanding What Your Order,"I was happy to have found the book I had been seeking, and trusted, (a word that should never be utilized in net-purchases)it to be new or nearly so, as the price was just that. However when I received the book I found reader notes amuck.I seldom if ever destroy the sacred pages of a book, especially one by such a beloved author with mindless ramblings but others do it and that is fine for them but they should NEVER attempt their resale with-out notice. This book is useless to me!"
1,Worked well before it died,I have used this unit for about 45 days of field work over two summers. It was always kept in a case and handled gently. It stopped powering up in the field. Seems to be the power switch. Worked well while it lasted but was not reliable for me.
2,Tingle Toes,This foot massager is easy to use and leaves your feet feeling tingly . The aftereffect is a mild sensation up the legs that feels like the circulation is going. Much better than the cheaper foot massagers that have no effect at all.Good to share with friends and family . A conversation piece that tickles the fancy ..
2,3 years and still hooked,"We love LOVE this baby wash. I have used it since my son was first born, and he will soon turn 3. It is expensive, but each bottle does last quite a long time, and its well worth it. The smell is wonderful, and doesn't last long--a good thing in my book, as I don't want him covered in scent, even a naural one. The foam is silky and rinses easily with no residue. When we use a different brand for travelling, I can always tell that his hair isn't as soft and clean as it is with his Earth Mama wash. I only wish I could afford to use it on myself too!"
2,"awesome, kind, sensible book","This book is full of valuable information for anyone thinking about getting a dog (whether from a shelter or any other source) as well as anyone in the animal welfare and sheltering field. Not only is it full of great information from someone who clearly knows what she's talking about, it's funny and interesting to read - I couldn't put it down!"
2,Worth it,"Quality is decent and I didn't notice any overly obvious interference sound issues. This length of the cable is great; long enough for me to plug my computer into my HDTV outside without having to worry about how short the cable is.For the price, I think its a decent purchase."
2,What a great song!,"I really enjoyed listening to this! It's sad but really good, I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Boring,"This book failed to engage me. The main character chooses to run away from her problems, and finds a handsome man who's all too willing to share his life with her. The little conflict felt manufactured to me."
1,Worst brand i have used,"90% of these discs won't play in my car. It doesn't matter if i burn them at 48x or 4x...they are almost all coasters. This is the first brand of CD-r's that i have had trouble with. I have good luck with Memorex, Maxell, TDK, Verbatim, etc."
1,Not really a children's film.,"I bought this DVD as a flick some children I babysit could watch. Good thing I watched it before they did. I have to say it's not really a children's movie & it is a bit of a downer as well. The preview makes one think it's a real fantasy film but, alas, it's short on fantasy & humor. NOT a feel good movie, IMHO."
2,Almost Perfect,"As desktop nearfield monitors, the DX4's seem almost perfect for the job. I would have given them 5 stars if M-Audio would have included grills of some kind (to protect what are reputed to be very delicate drivers, especially the tweeters). Aside from that, I'm very happy with the system so far. Flat, clean sound with plenty of volume even when I back away a few feet from my desk. Amazon's price (with free shipping) was right, too."
1,"Mirror, Mirror - don't bother","Don't believe what you read in some of the reviews. This really stunk, and I wish I could get my money back. As a rabid horror fan, with thousands of titles, this is one that I tossed in my donation bin. At least I got the tax receipt for my taxes."
2,The Queens of Noise's swan song,"After the personnel changes that occured at the conclusion of the girls' 1977 Japan tour this record shows the Runaways at the end of their existance. Starting with ""Queens of Noise"" the band had a formula for types of songs. For example, at least one track could be considered an anthem (Queens of Noise: title track, Waitin' for the Night: Little Sister), one track showcased Lita Ford's talents on lead guitar (Queens of Noise: Johnny Guitar, Waitin' for the Night: Fantasies). The only break in this pattern is Waitin' for the Night's title track, which is the Runaways' only (albeit hard-rock) ballad. For ""And Now.. the Runaways!!"" the anthem is Saturday Night Special and Lita Ford's guitar exhibit is on I'm a Million. This album is not the best of the bands work, that goes to the Live In Japan LP, but this is a historically significant work considering the later solo successes of both Ford and Joan Jett."
1,Watching people fight is a laugh riot?,"I'm a big Woody Allen fan, but this movie gaves me the creeps... Mostly, it is a series of arguments where the viewer feels like they're watching something very ugly happen right before their eyes. I certainly wouldn't call it comedy. I love every Woody Allen film except this one, I almost couldn't finish watching it; I felt so terrible when it was through."
1,Stink-o-rama,"This toy is not at all what it seems to be, doesn't work well, and isn't fun. My son played with it for about ten minutes. Once he realized how NOT fun it was, he put it in his room. It has been in his drawer since Christmas.I don't know who the people are who are giving this toy a positive review. They must have stock in the company or something. For the rest of us, this toy is stink-o-rama."
2,Definitely does the job,Very solid and a bit heavy but it has puliverized everything I've used it on in a very short time. Not too tough to clean. It would be difficult to imagine something better as far as a mortar and pestle goes. Even for smaller things like a little saffron it works just fine.
2,From the Belly of the Beast,"Short stories on the worst Rome has to offer. A little boy gets raped and killed. Two Albanian teenagers sold into Italian Prostitution. In Africa, a nun is raped by Muslim bandits. We get inside an insane asylum, hear about the abuse by a father, and ever so much more. In all the stories we see Police Commissioner Adele Sofia at work, at times helped by Inspector Marra.The stories are devastating because they ring so true. The author writes straight forward, not losing any time on asides or descriptions. Brute crimes, basic language."
2,Very Nice!,"This is a very good live set by Tiesto. Although I've heard much better sets by him before (too bad none of them have been comercially released). There are some key high points like tracks 4, 9, 11 &12. If you like this set, you'll probably like Magik 6 as well."
1,Who does this help?,"I'm not really sure who this book is supposed to help. It came to me and it's almost as small as a brochure (14 pages of photocopied nothing!). It gives tips that someone completely clueless would even know, i.e. always pay a little something on your credit cards, set money aside, invest in your future, pay off all past due bills. If you had the money to do all of these bullet-pointed things you wouldn't need a book like this to begin with! Is this guy serious? ...On the flip side, along with this worthless ""book"", I got The Budget Kit by Judy Lawrence. A few dollars more but an extensive look at how to work with your money and budget what you've got with an in-depth workbook and explanation of what it takes to get you back on the road to financial stability!"
2,"Excellent padding for heavier weights, bit of a bulky feel.","I do not have a great deal of experience with large varieties of weight gloves, but I do feel that these are very nice.Pros:Easy to put on and take off. The fins on each finger are very effective.Excellent padding covers the gloves making heavier weights easy. I actually had a hand injury (unrelated to lifting but why I got the gloves), I was able to lift using these without pain.Fairly good sizing chart. I believe I might have been able to get a slightly better fit in a perfect world, but these work very well.Cons:Bit of a bulky feel. I'm not certain that the quality could be obtained without having this bulkiness in the glove, but if you don't need as much padding you will likely find other gloves more comfortable."
2,70's Guitar Rock Defined.,"I used to listen to this album in '76 and now over 20 years later, found it at Amazon on CD. If you love 70's guitar rock, you will enjoy this album. Great songs, great guitar ala Doobie Brothers. My album collection would not be complete without this one."
1,Not originals!!,"I was very disappointed with this CD. These are not the Original Artists. If you are a purist as I am, you want the Original Artists that sang the song back in those days of great music. These are not the real thing. If you don't mind subs then you will like this."
1,Yuck,"As poor sounding a collection of songs as I've ever heard. I suppose when you mix two 1960's relics almost 40 years later this is what you get, and what you get is not pretty. One flash in the pan and another never was provide the muddy sounding vocals and the mixing was also poor in my opinion. Two songs are identical except that one is a solo version while the other is a dual vocal disaster called 'The Hungry Years'. Sure was a dissapointment when I heard this cd, and I ended up tossing it. Not recommended."
2,"Great book, great condition","This book was purchased in the used category, but came in brand new condition. Extremely interesting book that I have digested for school."
2,useful product,"Pros:-raises laptop screen to a more comfortable level-angle of keyboard make typing easier-keeps computer off of wood desk, no more marks on wood-provides for good ventilationCons:-requires attention to placing laptop correctly so it's not wobbly (only an issue if, like me, you are taking your laptop off the stand every day)"
2,Couldn't Put it Down,"I liked this book a lot. It made me want to laugh, cry and murder an already dead woman. It's the story of love cut off too fast for no real reason. The three sisters were holding on to so much pain from their mother that they could barely fuction in their own lives. Ms. Ansa truly out did herself with creating believeable characters that you can understand and relate to. This book is a great AA author starter book."
1,Over-priced,"Yeah, so I'm writing this review a few years after I purchased it. Never really liked over-paying for college textbooks so it's hard to give it even 2 stars...sorry, 1 star it is."
1,Agreement with Smalter & 'Don't Bother' reviews,"First of all, I am not a football fan, but when I first read about him, I became a fan of Walter Payton. I feel football was the medium for his message and he sent a great message, he was a truly great man. However, I did not feel this book did him justice. He wanted his life to serve as an inspiration to young people and it did, but the book missed the boat. Unfortunately this book will soon be forgotten. I felt like I had to wade through the dross of panegyrics to find some of the nuggets of true value. Someone must be able to write a inspirational book about this inspiring man."
1,VERY DISSATISFIED,"Not as advertised. Listed as new, but was refurbished. Toner all over inside of copy machine. Makes black copies. Am contacting seller to get this matter addressed. We shall see how it is handled. Do not like the fact it was refurbished not new. Very, very unhappy customer"
1,dont slag Baby Born....or else!!!!!!!,"i am a Baby Born defender and I want to say to M hutchison (the neurotic mom who babies her kids too much) that Zapf has NEVER, EVER marketed baby born as a potty training doll. they have marketed her as a friend, a sibling-prep doll, a baby doll, but never for potty training. so don't be dissapointed if your baby born doesnt teach potty training. and dont slag her just because youre too lazy to read and folow the instructions and actually TRY to make her work. who wants crappy ugly fat baby tubbles anyway? she sucks."
2,Excellent Example of the Genre,"This movie is a great example of the pinky violence genre, and I found it very enjoyable. Reiko Ike and Christina Lindburg are gorgeous and its difficult to take your eyes off of them while they are on the screen, whether clothed or not. I recommend to anyone."
2,A PAGE TURNER,"Street dreams is a classic, there is really no other way to put it.If anybody says they're not feeling this one, it's just that they are not in tune with the streets."
1,Save Your Money,"I really loved this pedometer when I first got it. It tracked everything I did, even the ""steps"" I took while working out with exercise DVDs. I loved that I could carry it in my pocket and it still accurately counted my steps. Then, the battery went dead. I replaced it, and it was no longer accurate. I re-entered the stride-length information, as the directions specified, and it just wasn't counting steps accurately anymore. I thought maybe I bought a bad battery, so I bought a new one and re-replaced it. Unfortunately, that didn't help. I'm very disappointed in this product."
1,Problem with packing,I returned this product because the bag was open when I received the package. I was very disappointed because I really wanted this product for my cats.
1,What is wrong with you people,"This is the worst game to ever *cough* grace *cough* *hack* a systems library of games. All you ever do is swim in a completely bland environment. Then, you engage in simple, boring, and extremely repetitive combat. The cutscenes, if you can call them that, are just comic style pictures with extremely corny dialogue. I HATE CORNY DIALOGUE. The only reason this game merits a single star is because the submarine fights, that kinda resemble something like fun, add a little variety. In a pinch, you could have more fun shooting yourself in the foot. Nuff said."
1,Totally useless book.,"This book does not have any important information and it constantly prompts you to his other one, the Mucusless Healing Diet (which is interesting but somewhat outdated for 21st century standards). Total waste of time and money. His cure of constipation is included in the above mentioned book. I follow a vegan diet and bought it out of curiosity, so I have to say if you are eating like an average American, it is a very radical change. Do not bother."
2,pope joan,Although lacking any scientific evidence the book presents a very interesting scenario that shows numerous clues for its authenticity.The fact that the catholic church denies all references to Joan makes the subject all the more intriguing.I'd have no problem recommending it for a read
2,"Before ""The Outsiders"" there was nothing.","This movie is absolutely great. There's not other movie of the same genre that can actually compare to this one. The story of these young men trying to fit in into society and the conflicts they encounter in life are just a short example of what this movie is all about. This is one of those movie that you watch and will stay with you FOREVER. It's not a big surprise that if it was based from a great book the result would be an even greater movie that everyone would enjoy watching. Before ""The Outsiders"" for me, there was nothing as big as this. I recommend this movie a 100% and I guarantee it has everything and even more of the things you look for in a movie. It has action, suspense, drama, sad scenes, and why not, romance everything done in a clean way. The format would show its age eventually but a master piece will never be too old or too bad for the new generation to enjoy it."
1,nice if it worked,"crucial online help useless,claimed product number wasnt their part,1 gig of two not ""seen""....64 bit mem sent for 32 bit os... since anything was better than 512 I just kept it....hassle to return. slot still shows empty...they fought me the whole way though I was pleasant and patient......I think it was just a bad day for me.---heed...Crucial fought me the whole way,even though I was patient and pleasant.ie its your fault. oh well..not gonna sweat it..gonna buy a voodoo anyways...so ill just give it free to one of my customers. and use someone else next time.I have installed over 1000 kits from other ""lame brand"" ie chineese with nary a problem and quick change out when I got a dead stick....which happens more often than people realize.things happen .. its how you fix the problem not whether a problem occurs."
2,A decent box set,"This set collects the seven individually-released Chobits DVDs and puts them into one package. The set also includes a soundtrack CD (Chobits: Character Song Collection).The extras on the DVDs were OK, but nothing overly spectacular. But compared to some anime DVDs I've seen recently, there's more in the way of special features on these discs than on DVD releases for other anime properties.The Character Song Collection is a decent soundtrack CD, although I would recommend the two soundtrack CDs (one with a black cover, the other with a white cover) over this one, especially since the audio CD included here does not have the opening credits song.If you're a fan of Chobits, this set is definitely worth it."
2,My Fisrt Piazzolla,A very good cd whith the best of Astor Piazzolla. Easy to know a good player and compositor. Very good music
1,It does not have quality graphics,My son would not even try to play it after it was cut on. It did not grab his attention.
2,Very satisfied with this purchase,"This is my first eco-drive watch, and the least expensive ne I have seen @ $87. I am very happy with this watch. After one day in the sun it is charged for 6 months. I was worried about the green strap, but it is a nice dark ""manly"" olive green. The face is clear and even the second hand stands out. My only negative, which is what you get for ordering on the internet, is the face is a bit smaller than I thought it would be. I thought it was large, but I would call this a medium sized men's watch."
2,"Good, and not as tough to read as the page count suggests","Jordan's first entry to this series is good--but not great inmy eyes.It's lengthy but a page-turner...there's no labor togetting through the book, which was a great relief to me.Much of Jordan's drama seems to rely on conversations which real people would never allow to happen--if one or two characters stood up and said ""Wait a second, I'm not finished yet"" or ""Perhaps I might offer my opinion here"" there would be much less of a book.Of course, fiction is supposed to deal with human failings, but it gets a bit ridiculous.The characters are fairly stereotypical--I've seen these people before and liked them better in other contexts--but not unredeemable. The pace is good and the scenes fairly vivid without getting too verbose.As an alternative, consider Zelazny's Amber series--you'll have read through all the good books in the same page count as this one, without being tied to reading 6+ sequels...END"
1,Don't work,"Unfortunately, i didn't look at any reviews before buying this product. Like others said, the range is not near six to ten feet, more like a few inches. My dog didn't even act like she heard anything either, it is worthless. I'm hoping I can return it."
1,Would not play on PS3,"I tried to play this DVD on my PS3 where I play all my movies and it would not play. It would load the main menu, but as soon as I made a selection it would lock up. If anyone has had success playing this on a PS3 would love to hear how."
2,The hands down best,"I have read many many fiction books in my life and whenever asked which my favorite is I never hesitate to answer ""Dermaphoria"". I am not sure where to begin with this book but I can say this much; across my right arm I now have a tattoo that says ""The Devil is Just the Angel who asked for More"". Chapter ten in itself is a mini masterpiece. Craigs writing style is the absolute cream of the crop. I love Chuck Palahniuk and Stephen King and perhaps Bret Easton Ellis, but this guy really stands alone in his craft. Craig only has two books currently in publication, this one and ""The Contortionist Handbook"", both phenomenal works but this one is my favorite. Enjoy it."
2,Great Little Workhorse,"This basket is well designed companion for those nearby errands. In a few seconds, it can either be taken off or be easily be moved from bike to bike without any tools. It a handy size and nicely carries two one gallon jugs of milk or a couple of mellons. Not too big, not too small."
1,"It's OK, but NEVER Littmann good!!!","This advertisement is written to confuse the buyer into getting this Everdixie stethoscope. I'm a fourth year medical student and I have to say this product is not actually bad, it allows a quite clear auscultation, but it is not littmann quality, as the promotion intends to imply.The company should show the product as it really is... an everdixie!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is a piece of GARBAGE! Poorly designed, flimsy plastic top that you have to hold down until the sealing begins....problem is the sealing NEVER begins. Run, don't walk, from this lemon. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trash."
1,One of the VERY WORST!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing.The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is ""How Technical Analysis Works"" by Bruce Kamich."
1,I wouldnt recomend,"After using he product I did not see any great improvement. Not only that, but my teeth were in sever pain that started about an hour after I used the product and continued until the next day. If I saw significant results I wouldn't mind the pain, but as it didnt really do anything for me, it was waste of time and suffering for nothing."
2,Great Product,"Read about this product in a vet column and they raved about it. So I tried some and was equally impressed. Within a few weeks, the tartar started dissolving from my dog's teeth. Nothing else worked. Great product!"
1,Needs to be edited MORE!,Send it BACK! If you bought this CD DON'T LISTEN!!! My mom ordered this for me because you could get it in a clean version. If this is clean what is the uncut version like? We're very disappointed with this CD.
1,MPI Goof,"I wanted to respond to the many reviewers regarding the poor audio quality of this DVD. Evidentally, the transfer was not up to the newer DVD player technology because it plays fine in my older player, but I experience a sound problem when I play it in my newer one. I intend to contact MPI and hopefully get this resolved, and a new, updated copy of this DVD.Until then, this one gets 1 star."
1,Not quite what I expected,"Not the original Betty Boop cartoons as they were but a recut ""remix"" with a voiceover by a Smothers brother."
1,Not worth it,"Listen to the other reviews. This book is just an encyclopedia of waste. At least an encyclopedia has pictures and examples; this book has neither. After the first 2 chapters, it's all downhill. It is a very frustrating read because there are absolutely no examples. It's all theory. Don't waste your money and don't listen to all the fancy quotes on the book's back cover. This book just doesn't cut it."
2,The Priests DVD,"I can't believe I did not know about this DVD earlier after it was made. I love sacred music and there are many beautiful, inspiring music for the soul. I love concertizing beautiful sacred music which lifts and nourishes the soul whether one attends a church or not. The music speaks for itself, we need more of this type of concerts, the Priests are great, I hope they continue to create more DVDs such as this. Music is another way communicating with God and the joy of the music certainly uplifts every soul who supports good music."
1,Didn't fit,I bought this and it didn't fit around the nano at all. I was very dissapointed as it is a nice product.
1,disappointing,"This book was very disappointing, and unfortunately, not at all reliable with regard to this information provided. It is ashame, because such an introduction to Hebrew, intended for the lay person, was definitely needed. Back to waiting..."
1,dead like me dead again,"Replacement actors suckedStory line not so goodDVD bad I mean bad it made noices all the through outOrginal crew did goodfor a dead person to show themself's to their family then die again""dead like me dead again"" stick a fork in it's done"
2,This is a great learning toy and lots of fun too!!,"My 14mo. old son loves this toy. He received it for Christmas last year and it has been one of his favorites ever since. It was great for tummy time play when he first got it. Now that he's bigger he loves to chase after it and listen to it sing. I know he'll love it as he gets older too. I use it in my preschool classroom, and the children love it. Its been great at helping them recognize their alphabet and helped them learn letter sounds too. This is a great toy, I recommend it to everyone."
1,Not if you're into the 1970's classics.,"Certainly there is room for more than one ""best of"" commercial parody disk from SNL. This one contains a lot of the more recent stuff, but a lot of that stuff is more crass than clever. There is the classic bass-o-matic and the classic car commercial with the circumcision in the back seat, but were is ""Quarry"" cerial, and the triple blade razor (which has since become reality), and ""Tryopenin"" arthritis medication? I know there are others tooOf course, there are the early seasons out in box sets, so I suppose they're on those."
1,get what you pay for,"I realize it wasn't that expensive, but I had serious issues with this. The directions say to press the two pieces together and recommend a rolling pin. However, neither piece make it easy to roll. The plastic part is what holds the filling, so it is bumpy. The metal part had feet on the bottom so you can't use a rolling pin there either. Also after you press them together, you still have to use something to cut them apart. Depending on how wet or dry your pasta is, or the filling makes it... it could stick to either of the pieces. I had tried using some non stick spray but that only made the pasta more moist and sticky. Be ready to have a few bad batches."
1,Knockoff,"Aside from the fact that it took two weeks for my order to arrive, once it finally arrived the shirt appeared to be a knockoff. In comparison to another Duofold item I purchased from another seller, this shirt is clearly inferior - not only is the material different but the tag appears to be an iron-on copy with several of the words blacked out. I would never buy from this seller again."
2,Silky enticing vocals. Listen or dance to this music.,Catchy rhythms and melodious lines. Original and sure to cross over. Any serious collector of latin music will want to own this CD. I believe this group did backup for Roberto Carlos.
1,beware,This seller brilliant store does not sell the Fedco battery. I received a Dekcell battery that they also sell thru Amazon for a lesser price. It would only last for 1 hour. They did give me a refund but I am out the shipping cost. Beware the bait and switch.
1,An awful read.,"What caught my eye as a potentially interesting book regarding an ""expose"" into chiropractic turned out to be nothing more than a witch hunt based on biases and misrepresentation. As I read through the chapters, I started to get an impression that these authors were willing to base gargantuous claims on little or partial pieces of evidence simply to make the book more tantalizing.Spin Doctors is a written form of Jerry Springer if I have ever seen one, but at least Jerry doesn't come across with the supposition of being credible. While his show doesn't disguise the fact that it is not to be taken seriously, I get the distinct impression that Benedetti and Macphail wrote this book with the express purpose of discrediting a profession. Personally, I did not appreciate their attempts at taking advantage of a reader's trust or trying to make money from unjustly attacking others.Unless you are interested in seeing true ""manipulation"" at it's best, I'd stay away from this book."
1,unimaginative projects,"The projects are unimaginative. The book starts with a pinch pot. Why? I have only seen a good looking pinch pot once, when shown by a professional potter.The rest of the projects are all cliches with no imagination also."
2,Not the John-Boy we know and love,"Richard Thomas comes out of Duluth's Congdon Mansion woodwork to pester a young Patty Duke in this 1972 pre-slasher thriller. He's more like ""The Shining""s Jack Nicholson than John-Boy Walton. ""You'll Like My Mother"" is a variation on the Captive In A Snow Storm theme that works very, very well. Not a good palliative for cabin fever, as it will induce more anxiety than it cures, but be brave! Turn down the lights, stoke up the fireplace, get some Hot Chocolate, and meet ""Mother."" Or be really, really brave and make it a Triple Feature: ""You'll Like My Mother,"" ""Misery,"" and Jack's ""The Shining."" Reviewed by TundraVision"
2,My opinion of Kindle.,"Thanks for my Kindle. I'm really glad that I purchased it. I've had it for a couple of weeks now and have all ready read 6 books.It's remarkable how easy it is to preview, review and purchase what I want and in seconds. Great! You did a good job.Again, thank you."
2,SCARY -- WONDERFUL -- HIS BEST YET!!!!!!,"This book fits in the class with The Shining, it is mesmerizing, frightening. The story is wonderful, it is fast paced and it doesn't explode in exaggeration at the end. From the very beginning it draws you in, it is scary and the characters are so real, one comes to really care for them, alive and dead. There is no better combination! If you read any King at all, read this and The Shining!"
2,Life doesn't always go as we want. This might help.,"Life does not always go as we want... as we had hoped... dreamt... prayed.This book was written to help people coming out of relationships that were brought to an end... by choice... by accident... by illness... by betrayal by the other... by whatever reason.Regardless, at some certain point, reality has to be accepted, and you need to move on. You can only suffer for so long.This book is both a crutch and a companion. It can be a guide. It is certainly worth the read."
2,Meets Expectations!,"This screen met all my expectations when I installed it and started watching movies. The installation was very easy and obvious. Dimension published on manufacturer's web site does not include this screen model but I was able to guess it based on similar model with black case (This model has white case and image published by Amazon on product page is misleading). I have been using this screen almost daily since last two weeks- opening, projecting movies on it and closing, and so far its performance has been solid. Picture is vivid and sharp. I really don't know any other way to evaluate the projector screen. I bet more knowledgeable folks would have better technical feedback however it does get two thumbs up from me."
1,Garbage from Garbage!!!,This is the most poorly written book that I have ever read. American Indians should be insulted. This book was actually written by a former Ku Klux Klansman to mock an entire race of people. There is no merit or salvation in this book as other readers have claimed. And I suspect that they liked the book because they are racists as well. This is a deplorable effort from a man who is not worth any more of my valuable time.
2,The best Science fiction movie of the year,"The Matrix was the most unpredictable, awe-inspiring, edge-of-your-seat movie I saw this year. This DVD offers a basket full of behind the scenes video and audio commentary. If you don't have it, get it now."
1,A Memory of Love,"Not like her other books at all. More recent works including this one seemed to be rushed there is not the magic of the story like there is with Love Wild and fair, Skye O'Malley, or A Love for All time, just to name a few. Though I read the book cover to cover I was disgusted with the fact that I had paid fifteen dollars for that. The battle scene with Rhowyn was hyped in the synopis and jacket covers but it only lasted for three pages. I was expecting a strong feamle character and was extremely disappointed. Unlike many of her other books I was not drawen into the story of the principle female character. It seems like Small is writing books these days only to earn the money. She has come out with several books each year recently and they seem poorly written compared to her earlier works."
1,"This one misses, but....","After realizing, some time ago, that the main reason I listened to Pat Matheny recordings was because of the piano, I bought all of Lyle Mays' CDs, and he has become one of my favorite jazz composers and performers. His technique is excellent, and his compositions can be both lyrical and challenging. He has something to say with his music, which is surprisingly rare among many otherwise gifted performers.If he ever records another solo performance, I will buy it because I know he has a great talent and is capable of delivering a stunning solo performance. However, this first try is awful."
2,Love the book version,I love the book and have a hard copy. The kindle version would be better if it had a jump feature.
2,ANXIOUSLY WAITING,"I have just started going through my Country phase and have started listening to country music during the day. When I first heard ""Wish You Were Here"", I waited to hear who the artist was .... and everytime they played the song, never once did I hear the artist's name. I finally called the radio station last week and asked. The DJ thought I was a total idiot because I asked who sang that song. And now that I know, I'm anxiously waiting my CD in the mail. Everytime I hear that song, listening to the words makes me teary-eyed (I'm also a little emotional from being pregnant). When my coworkers ask why I'm so emotional, I try to explain the ""hidden meanings"" I get out of that song. Do you all think that ""this place"" is refering to Heaven? The people he sees that she knows say hello,those have to be her family and friends in Heaven???? Such a wonderful song. the other songs are great too. BUY IT!"
2,I like it but...,"The reviewer who said it isn't as powerful as the older model is right. I had one of the older models, and finally ""did mine in"" from use.Even so, I feel it's a decent machine, because my pain is quite intense and requires a subtler deeper massage. If that's what your looking for (this one won't make your teeth vibrate) this is the machine for you."
1,lasted six weeks,"I bought one of these after buying one of the cheaper ones. It worked great on my auto accident injured neck. If you have ever been on a $ 10,000 cervical traction machine at doctors the relaxing sensation is similar. Unfortunately, it blew out at about six weeks."
2,Sexy!!!,These boots are really sexy! The fit nicely and are comfortable. This is the first time I have gotten platform style boots and I was afraid that I was gonna break my neck but they are actually very easy to walk in. I love them!
1,Minute and hour hands mis-aligned.,"The hour and minute hands were mis-aligned, so that the clock was always exactly two minutes off. Multiple attempts to reach LaCrosse support via email and telephone were futile. Long holds only to be shunted off to voice mail, which promised to return the call, but never did."
2,you can't take this book from teen's it's like video games,"One of the most intersting books ever, you'll get attached to it like leeches to your body.Cole saw a spirit bear will he ever see it again!(read the book for more detials).Will Cole ever get out of the island?.Cole is strong I like him, he fouht with a bear for his life!.He turns out to be a good preson.(read it for more details, man!).One thing I would change about this book is to make it shorter it's just too long.I recomend this book to teens because it's a little hard to read."
1,"Predictable, boring, typically formulaic Turtledove drivel.","If you like predictable psuedo-historical formulaic drivel you'll love the continuation of the Videssos Cycle. This book, like so many of the author's, uses repetitive and unimaginative language and themes. Turtledove uses the same phrasing, the same situations, even the same quotations from one book to another. The simple stories go nowhere and the characters are one dimensional and unbelievable. These type of alternative historical novels have been done so much better by almost any author that has laid pen to paper."
2,wonderland,"More dazzling writing and thinking from Swift, who would have earned five stars for this had he not written Waterland, still his best book. Not since another Graham -- Greene -- has there been a writer to write such beautiful, wonderful, thought-provoking sentences -- especially to end chapters. And his ability to connect seemingly disparate thoughts and occurences and motives is unrivaled.For my money, Swift is the greatest living English novelist. And only One Hundred Years of Solitude is a more impressive novel than Waterland."
1,remember when hip hop was synonymous with TRUE expression?,"there once existed an emcee who had the ability to paint landscapes of haunting beauty.....told stories so detailed that you could literally invision yourself in the same position or situation....acquired the privileged ability to flow like hot descending pop corn butter into an empty bag....this emcee could battle any other contender out there....now, sadly, he has been consumed by the commercialism that he so vehemently & naturally went against....bye for now NAS....until we meet again...until music is once again emblematic of ART...shall you join us?? let's hope...."
2,Watch out!! Here he comes again!!!,"I discovered this series last year while surfing the amazon website for new author's to read. When I came across Lee Child I read the reviews you guys wrote about his books. They were all positive. So I started at the beginning and read The Killing Floor. From then on I was hooked. You will too if you haven't read this series. The Hard Way is a great story. I won't go into detail because many of these reviews have that info already. I will just say this is a great addition to the series,very worth while, however I would love more action with Jack, kicking some butt. I had to wait until the end to get it this time."
1,Too small,"It's cumbersome to use, the mirror is too small, and its difficult to set up. I didn't like that, I prefer to have one fixed to my bike."
2,This Show Changed my Life,"This show manages to use a serious, gritty, believable, sci-fi backdrop to explore issues of war, peace, politice, religion, hope, doubt, apocolypse, forgivenss, trauma, surviving, guilt, loyalty and how one ship, built by the hands of man and machine and blessed by gods, can change 2 races forever.It also never lets up on the cylong killing, super graphics destructo action.Simply put, the best show I have yet seen. And will ever see.I will always miss you, Commander Adama, Laura, Thrace, Baltar, the 12, the 12 and Daniel...if only we knew you."
2,WOW! Extremely Emotional! No human words to decribe it fully!,This book is a work of art! it just grabs you and it is vurtualy impossible to but the book down! I could fel the emotion of every character and the words painted every pictured that I needed to make sense of the story. There are no human words to decribe all the emotion in and from this book! A MUST HAVE!
2,Satisfied Customer,"I purchased this product to be able to bring work home. Although it is something I shouldn't do because home time should not be spent working. I am satisfied and pleased with the product. I am able to save my files and work on them at work, at home or on any computer because the flash drive is attached to my key ring. This drive is small and discrete and since it is with my keyring, I take it wherever I go. It also holds music files, so when I am working on my files I can listen to some of my favorite tunes."
2,Wish I could give this ***6*** stars!!!,"My son and I love, love, love this toy! He just turned two and he recites his whole alphabet...pretty amazing for a kid who's been in speech therapy since 11 months! I am convinced that his rapid turnaround has had something to do with this toy. He repeats the letters and the sounds every time he puts a letter in the holder and is now working on the singing part. Every bit of this toy is very durable and easy to clean. Sticks great on the fridge and comes in handy while I'm cooking dinner. I do agree with another reviewer about wishing letters came with this too. Buy this toy...you won't be disappointed!!!"
2,Best book!,"I am not a big reader, but this book took me by suprise. I loved this book and couldnt put it down because it hit so close to home. Everything seemed so real,from the characters, to the reactions, to the war & most of all the love story. I almost felt like i was one of the main characters because the author gives such a vivid deccription of the characters emotions,reactions & feelings. After the book was done, i didnt want to say goodbye to the characters, and i wished it would have ended like a typical love story, although the novels ending wasn't shocking, but sad. Almost like a movie your really into and then watch the ending and feel empty & wish everything had a ""happily ever after"" ending. I would deffenitly recommend this novel."
2,Must read,"I truly enjoyed reading this book. It's informing, sad at times and truly caputures this unknown world in a way that you can't help but help these people. Greg Mortenson deserves a Nobel prize for his humanitarian efforts there. It's hard to believe such people still exist. Not sure why he didn't win the Nobel Prize but in my eyes he's a top winner. I just bought his new book (Stones Into Schools) and can't wait to start reading it."
2,We love this movie!,Ever since my children were young we have watched the Wee Sing movies. It's a Christmas tradition in our family!
1,I was disappointed,"I did not read the fine print, I thought this was Bishop Paul S. Morton new album it is not it is the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship Mass Choir CD, he doesn't sing until track 8 the other 18 tracks are various artists , who sound good, however that is not what I throught I purchase when I receive the CD."
1,Didn't work for us.,"The lactation consultant recommended these bottles to use while breast-feeding. We were having troubles latching on and were told the wide nipple would help him get a wide mouth. These bottles didn't work for us. The nipple flow was too fast. They dripped all over. He was very fussy after eating because of the gas. The Mylicon drops didn't help much.I even tried the Avent bottle with the plastic bag for less air. It didn't work either. It was impossible to get all of the air out. There is a feature at the bottom of the bottle to push up the liquid, but it didn't go all the way to the top and was also frustrating. Plus, the regular Avent nipples don't work with this bottle. You have to buy more nipples. We didn't care for these at all."
2,*Phat*,I thought this cd rocked!! I loved all the SONGS!!! And they are a really great group.....hopefully they will keep up the great WORK!
1,Not as good as I expected,I initially had a dex food mill which was just perfect. It prepared the baby food in just seconds and made a smooth paste as my baby liked it. However accidently it broke and I had to purchase a new one. Thats when I thought will try something new and got this kidco food mill. But to my disappointment its not working as expected. The motor goes on as soon as I connect it to the power supply ( even before I press it down as per the instructions ). Also the food is not mashed completely and my baby is not enjoying it.
1,NO WAY would i recommend this,I bought this with high hopes... they were shattered! my little one could kick his feet out within min. Also I contacted the company and they are SOOOO rude and hard to deal with. Don't do it. Learn how to swaddle well with a regular blanket
2,Useful utility table,"This is a useful utility table - exactly what I was looking for. It stores neatly in the closet until needed for use, and then sets up quickly."
2,Softpaw is WRONG. This Tea is Awesome,"I have tried every flavored tea known to mankind that I have access to and by far Walters Bay is the best for flavor AND for value. Raspberry, Mango, Peach, and Plain iced are all wonderful and 1 pouch will brew 2.5 gallons of tea. 2.5 GALLONS! I bought the flavor sampler from them and each version yielded the same result. Yes its a dark brew but so what...for me that translates into my tea dollar stretching much farther than ANY of their competition. I am not a tea snob by any means and ONLY drink iced versions. Period. So it may be that for the tea snob inclined the flavor, body, bouquet, balance, yadda yadda may disagree with you and if so, so be it. For me, Walters Bay is a perfect and very economical replacement for Paradise Tropical, China Mist, and all other flavored variants. And for the tea snobs out their, Walters Bay Tea has won multiple awards details of which can be found at their website."
2,Makita Grinder Review,"We just finished our review of this grinder and it is very nice. As the other user noted that he was having problem cutting through rebar, we cut through it with no problems. He is right, if you are cutting all day, you might want to go with a corded version. We also cut some concrete and it didn't bog down. Overall a very nice grinder."
2,"A classic, I wish Part II would cme out",I LOVE Mel Brooks. The first time I saw History of the World I went looking for part two!!!!!! I am trying to own all of his movies. This movie is filled with stars and will have you peeing your pants from laughing so hard
1,"Say, wha?","Um, can you say one of the worst movies ever? The only man that fell here was me..falling for the price of renting this horrible movie! Lifeless, dreary, and humorless. Perhaps has something to do with the depressing plot: A loser janitor (Dylan Baker), listens to opera and has emotional and social issues. Fast forward to he meets up with another loser (Hutton), and his loser shop-lifting wife (Stone). Stone looks stoned. Stone looks yucky. Somewhere I lost interest. I think it was like right after the opening credits. No. Maybe it was the awful acting. Still, it could have been the lack of a coherent plot, I don't really know or care. But if you want a ""gripping psychological thriller"" as the box claims, then you'll do yourself a favor and keep looking. What a waste of talent."
2,Urantia,"I love, love, love this book! I was introudced to it back in 1993 and live by it's words. It is the Bible of the future. I pray that many more people will reap it's benefits. I am also so thrilled to have the CD version to listen to while I'm on the move. Thank you Amazon for carrying this special book in your stock. The online purchase was so simple to accomplish. I have bought other books since and will continue to use Amazon! You are the best =)."
1,HELLOOOO.....I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!!!!,"GOOD LORD, WHERE'S THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THIS?????? WAIT, THERE IS NONE. It's sorta fun for my three year old, she gets pretty bored with it easily. I think I'm going to duck tape the speaker right now, maybe that will help."
2,Wonderful Sound!,This trumpet is a great buy for beginners or intermediates who want a great sounding instrument. It has great intonation and clarity.
2,Short Corcuit,"Great movie for young kids. Seller sent clean, well wrapped DVD. Would recommend the seller to friends."
1,I hate the annoying 'seat squeak',"I got two of these and they both have a annoying 'seat squeak' damaged saddles? No way--I Re-assemble saddle clamp with saddle in place, applying a small amount of bike grease to all external and internal threads--STILL A annoying 'seat squeak'"
1,rip off,it is outrageous the price they are asking for this here. when you can buy the book from the author's web site for $97.00. still better than the $300.00 they were asking for last time. that's why i gave this one star not because of the content.
1,Sucks,I have only had this unit for less then 5 months....and it no longer works. What else can I say. DO NOT BUY.
2,Gelomyrtol,Took this after I had a sinus infection and it helped get rid of it! Probably would've worked better/faster if I'd have used it shortly after I got the infection. Order enough to have some on hand to nip the sinus infection in the bud when it surfaces - I did.
2,Highly entertaining,"I just love the tempatations and always have, I was born in Detroit when some of their hits were being produced. I now live in Europe, but when I hear them I almost get goose-bumps, I get in the best mood, a definite natural high. I share a love of this group with people everywhere, starting from my grandmother and going down. The movie supposedly tells their story, with a few alterations that is. It shows how success messed up some of their lives and how for others although, it made them very happy, there were still some more important elements missing in their lives. It's a good, long story with lots of music and drama. I only wish they had gone on making music together for a longer time and with less problems of all sorts. They were so good and blended in so well together. They'll always be a soul legend."
1,80 Great Natural Shade Garden Plants,"Not so good. Just a list of plants for the shade. Expected more about shade gardening. Also, a very small book in size."
1,This is ...[no good],Average Review:This is cool 'cause I read about it in ...[magazines] and they said it was cool and now I like it a lot even though it is pretty bland and isn't very interesting musically or lyrically.But Chris has some really cool tattoos!
2,damn nice,"Upon repeated listenings, this is a beautifully crafted album .. all we want from Tull !! I really like it . I mean REALLY like it. My only complaint, is that on some of the tracks I think the drummer could have done more. Enough said. I love this album."
2,An amazing book!,"I read this book to help me find answers to my questions about strict Church guidelines. My questions were answered with this book. This book is wonderful in showing how the inerrancy of the Bible is ridiculous and how ""traditional"" practices of the Church are not traditional at all. Jesus would actually be considered a heretic to these Churches. The Southern Baptists and other ""Christians"" have used the name of Jesus to preach hate. Jesus was a teacher of unity and love, whereas the fundamentalist Churches of today teach separation, hate, and fear. These cannot be farther from the truth of what Jesus wanted to teach. The differences between the ""Church of Love"" and the ""Church of Law"" are striking. Hopefully, more people will read this book and come away with the same message as I did."
2,Instructional,"There's not a huge number of spinnaker instructional videos online and this one, from Canadian Yachting, is helpful.It has tips from Tom Whidden an America's Cup sailor (Tactician for Dennis Conner) and some good shots on the water and with model boats and sails that help viewers visualize spinnaker-handling basics and various ways that one can affect the spinnaker's sail shape to meet the windy or light conditions. From the VHF tapes in the video and the old clothes, I'm guessing the video was shot sometime in the late 80s--so, cutting edge, this isn't. Still, it's worth a watch."
2,Barbecue grill cover,"Good quality. Equally as good as the highly-touted Weber grill cover, although a bit long. Had to trim about 4 inches all the way around the bottom."
1,Won't last-save your money,"This toaster is very big & bulky on the countertop. I bought this toaster so we could do 6 slices- not really!!. It's great to use to bake cookies and pizzas. Note of caution once the toaster gets hot it burns food, toast ,etc fast! Another fun thing is the door fell off- just after 1.5 years perfect after the warranty wore off. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this as buy."
1,Broke during warrantee- will TEAC honor warrantee?,"About 10 months after I bought this CD Player, it died. I sent it in for warrantee service on 3-23-2006 - yet as of today, 8-4-2006, I have not received it back. The service center says that Teac needs to deliver a part. Teac acknowledged as much. For a while, Teac said they would try to find the part, but now Teac no longer even answers email, and telephone support seems non existant.Bottom line: Maybe you'll be lucky, and your machine won't break right away, but if it does, even if it is warranted, good luck!"
2,Great Starter Set,"I purchased this set as a gift for my teenager who wanted to try calligraphy. It is perfect. I looked at sets that had more and less nibs, but this selection of nibs is just the right number for a starter set. It writes beautifully, and is used almost daily."
1,Sacrafices Melody and good hooks for Heaviness(Big Mistake!),What it is about working with producer Roy Z.??This is the second time a great artist who has worked with him has released a very disappointing follow up to a excellent debut!It happened with Bruce Dickinson and now with Rob Halford..I realize an artist doesn't want to make the same cd over and over again but to do a complete 180 and go in the exact opposite direction from brillant to mediocre blows my mind!!I can only guess that they(the artist) are listening to Roy Z. too much.Both follow up CD's by Dickinson and Halford try to be TOO HEAVY and to me totally miss the mark because of it.
1,gee...made in Bollywood?,"geee,,,,police are bad people? I didnt know this. What else I didnt know?Hollywood and Bollywood same company?I guess I was not really smart when paid 14$ for nonsense but, after all, not much in life make much sense anyway."
1,Good while it lasted but only lasted a month,"The light looks pretty decent, the reviews were great, but mine stopped working 2 days after the ""return window expired""! The light comes on when I flick the switch manually to reset the mode, but then goes off after a few minutes and picks up no motion after that. Would've hoped for it to last at least a few years. Now I gotta deal with calling the manufacturer to figure out the issue."
1,Dreadful,"This movie was just dreadful. From it's turtle pace and horrible acting, to the ill-concieved notion that a half naked, muscular man in clown makeup is frightening. Nothing worked in this film. There are so many fantastic indie horror films out there, please save your dollars and pick something else as ""Fear of Clowns"" is just a bottom of the barrel horror film."
2,"Ok, but its a different band now","With a new singer comes a new sound. While its a good cd, i was dissapointed. Sonic Praise was the best cd they put out. I couldnt wait for this one to come out. Oh well :(. While they have a few good songs, the rest will have to grow on me."
1,"Some good raw ideas, but terrible arrangement.","There are several points where this music is actually good. Unfortunately, those peaks are surrounded by wide valleys of poor arrangement and overzealous mixes. Mike achieves many exciting ideas, but explores them only shallowly. Part II killed the listening experience for me. The rage-filled gutteral screaming is tasteless and out-of-place. If I can't return this CD, it will quickly become a coaster."
1,Zareba K9 Electric Fence Charger - Don't Buy This Unit,"Very disappointingZareba K9 Fence Controller for Zareba Pet and Garden Kit. Just doesn't work, and after several calls to the manufacturer's tech support group - who are pleasant and helpful, they said to return it (but from the techie's comments it sounds like they get a lot of complaints about the K9 unit.) And NO, it wasn't my wiring, since my 17-gauge galvanized wired fence line with porcelain insulators activated just fine as soon as I connected it to a Havahart charger SS-725, which, unlike the K9, has a conventional ground terminal."
1,Broke too quickly,"I bought this pair in June and by September there is no sound coming from out of the right side. When they worked, they worked fine. Not anymore."
2,Bullfighting at its best!,"The title is perfect. The topic is not new, but this treatment deserves attention. Although the authors get themselves a bit tangled up from time to time, trying to be just a little too clever, they do a good job entertaining with their examples of dumb-speak. Highly recommended, particularly as a gift to the appropriate business colleagues."
2,Great BluRay,"An ageless wonder with hours of extras. Just in time for Xmas. Thanks Amazon for great price, both for movie and shipping(free)."
2,Great Read!,I found this book in the library and picked it up on a whim. I started to read and was blown away by the rich texture of the story.The premiss of the book fascinated me; tidea of reading about women who lived during Old testament time was excitig and new; the details of the period added rich color and life to these well known characters.I loved the book and am sad there was not more to hear from Dinah or the author. For similar premises I recomend works by India Edgehill.please visit me at BookDevour.blogspot.com
1,yuck,"Shouldn't be called hardon because it is super floppy. It also has a pungent ""blueberry"" odor with it. It is super slim line as it did nothing for me...looks to be more for rear end pleasuring... The smell and uselessness of this made me throw it away. The balls on this are laughable."
2,Nice for the Price,"I shopped around before ordering this bag. It has a very nice look to it, professional in every way. There is plenty of room for your laptop, accessories, files etc. I would highly reccomend this for the business traveler. It is slightly on the heavy side for daily use, probably due to the rigid construction that provides protection around the laptop compartment; a fair trade off if you think about the protection afforded the laptop. If you travel, this is the bag for you."
2,A doozie,"Next to Othello, Shakespeare's most haunting royal tragedy. And quite easy to follow along, if you delve closely into the language. King Lear was more complex but the theme of callous ambition still rings true today, with elements of the supernatural thrown in for good measure, such as Banquo's ghost and those sublime cackling old witches. Best enjoyed if you just mouth the words out loud, or better yet, see a production of it lived out on stage. The action is fast, and really, you can read the whole thing in probably about an hour."
2,Cute and effective,"I love this grinder. I bought it in red and it's a really pretty, vibrant, true red. I like the looks of it so much that I tend to 'forget' to put it back in the cabinet after use.As for function, there's a lot to like there as well. I bought it for grinding spices and flax seed. I've used it almost daily for one or the other (mainly flax). Some reviewers complained that the stainless steel didn't go all the way to the top but there would be no point - the lid fits inside and rests on top of the stainless edge.I personally wouldn't recommend this for grinding coffee. I use the Krups burr grinder for coffee beans (close to 10 years now) and it works great. However, this little blade grinder is perfect for quickly pulsing spices and seeds.I think the cord is the perfect length, on par with that of my slow cooker, blender, and similar appliances. Any longer and it would just be a hassle wrapping it up for storing in the cupboard."
2,Dangerous,"This book really makes you wonder who is more dangerous, humans or animals? The safari guide, Mark Ross, is a first class adventurer with 9 lives."
1,How Loud can you go,"I found this trainer online and read the reviews and i was expecting it to be a little loud..but it is way TOO LOUD..the faster you ride the louder it gets, i thought i could drown it out with headphones, but nope..if you are looking for something quieter, spend the extra money. Wont be riding this at 5am, I will wake the whole house. You get what you paid for, and it is not peace and quiet."
2,Never leave home without it!,"When ever I leave home(for any reason whatsoever), I grab my keys, my wallet, and my NIV Life Application Study Bible. Period, end of story!"
1,don't buy this product from alternate new and used sources!!,"I have used this product and been very happy in the past. I gave my set away and wanted to replace it, so visited the Amazon site. My mistake was ordering from another source through Amazon, and although they show the product description as same with ""2 miracle balls included"", only a book arrived. I can tell you that you do not get the same results rolling around on the book. The 2 small balls make all the difference. Be sure that the product description is accurate. I was told by seller that they would not accept return."
2,"Truly eye-opening, again...","Like in his two other books, Mark Rashid manages to share his ideas in a fascinating manner in ""Horses never lie"". Impossible to stop reading. Even more impossible to not want to go straight away to see your horse and watch him/her with new eyes, listen to him/her with new ears."
2,bump under toe hurts at first,"These look comfy and in a way they are. Good arch support. My problem was th e bump under the toes, the right foot hurt me for a week or so and still bothers me a bit. I live in NYC and walking in flips flops/sandals is wearing on your ankles and feet. Not to mention getting home and seeing how DIRTY your heals are. EEEK! The birkis eliminate that which i love."
1,Unbelievably Poor,"I read approximately 2/3 of the way through this book. While it's amazingly well-substatiated, Mr. Pfeffer has used numerous resources to state his case.Unfortunately, the position he takes is about 180 degrees out of whack with the position taken by those who founded our nation!Nothing like rewriting history..."
1,The defuser Melted at the bottom and was a fire hazard. Also made the place smell like burning plastic.,however I manage to save the pharmone oil and put in in a spray bottle with water and the do scratch less. It would best to invest in the spray and its cheaper too.
1,Think twice before renting - silly dialogue,"We love Chris Pine and Renne Witherspoon but this movie was just bad! Sorry guys. The dialogue was poor, not close to reality, and derevative. Just silly! Not worth 3.99."
2,Brake Pads,"OK quality, and little dust now that they are bedded in. These are OEM pads so you do need to work the clips at the back to get a good fit into the barrel of the piston"
2,He's eating my brain!,"I'm watching my third tapeof this movie, having worn the others out. I love everything about it, from the kids (the boy reminds me of my own little brother, while the daughter is, well, the friendly sort). Capt Ron himself is a free spirit, and manages to to get the Harvey family to enjoy life the same way. This is one of those movies that gets under your skin, and you find yourself quoting lines from it all the time. I keep coming here to see if it's on DVD, because I'd like to stop wearing out VHS tapes. I would also like to see the soundtrack. That way I could listen to it and imagine the movie. This is great entertainment! I wish they made more like it. Whenever I see Kurt Russell, I think of Captain Ron."
2,Bringing the exiled voices to light!,"The author has done a wonderful service to any student of Jewish thought and history, by providing this survey of the works of sephardic world, which so often goes overlooked. Due to the vast amount of material covered, the book only provides a brief overview, but it whets your appetite to know more. The tone of the book is academic."
1,It's not what advertised,"The base of the wiper fitted correctly. However, the BMW 525i, has a rounded windshield. So even with all the pressure points, that they say it has, it doesn't fit the windshield. Only the corners touches the glass, the rest not even close.So, beware, it's not what they say it is."
2,This product works,My old tom cat Old Lad who had adopted me as a stray had tapeworms and I wanted to do something about it to make him well. I got the Tape Worm Tabs for Cats and a single dose did the trick and he has been free of the problem since.
1,Just Left Me With A Headach,This game was the worst I'v ever played. The graphics were bad and the game play was impossible. It is true that the only way to score is to take it to the hoop. There are no real special parts about the game. I think you should just ignore this game because no good or fun comes from it.
2,Time Traders,"I lthought it is a great story about time travel, but didn't cover the bio-war that was started in the past.Time Traders"
2,Summer Island,I really enjoyed SUMMER ISLAND. My mother died 30 years ago at the age of 58 and I still miss her. I have two daughters and I have always tried to be there for them. It's amazing what good came from all the bad things that happened to Nora. I'm glad that she was able to overcome them and explain to Ruby and Caroline what had happened and why. Eric and Dean were an added bonus.
2,Excellent,This is an excellent feild manual for identifying edible and medicinal plants. Very extensive information on all plants in the eastern United States. With this manual i'll never ever go hungry.
1,"errors, errors, errors,","The Preface of the THIRD edition (1999) states "" We have taken particular care to ensure that the text is free of errors"". If this isn't misleading, I don't know what is. The books is loaded with errors, misprints, and poorly worded sentenses. Many of the imperfections are carried over from the previous edition but new ones also appear. No students should be required to buy this book until a clean second printing is available.The second edition (1999) of Miessler and Tarr contains errors but at least the solutions manual comes with a list of ""the corrections that are most important for student use of the text""."
2,my favorit book,p.s. longer letter latter i my favorit book. i finished this book in one day because it was such a good book. if you do like books in letters or diary form then this would be a great book to read.Two best friends broken apart in a move and all they have left is letters back and forth and very very ocational visits to one and others houses.
2,My recommended buy,"Had bought a set of the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick cookware, but it did not include a 2 qt. covered Saucepan.This size is something I use a lot. I love the lighter weight than the 14 yr. old set we had. The rubberized handle and lid are great.I love the glass lid and the nonstick finish is great! Clean-up is very easy. I don't use high heat as directed, but do boil in the saucepanwithout any damage being noted. I highly recommend this size pan and the whole set. It is less expensive than some of the more popularbrands, but I like the look and function better. I am a very satisfied customer."
2,Super film,"Loved the entire Highlander series. Super adventure, great action scenes and a handsome leading man. Good film to curl up with on a cold day."
2,No other book has impacted me as this one...,"What I have learned in this book has directly and indirectly been used throughout many years. No other story has affected me like The Hiding Place. It has been such an encouragement; and how blessed I am to know about the ten Boom family and Corrie's testimony! Her books and videos have had a profound impact on me, and countless others."
2,good case,"This is a good case for my new Sony camera, though the value for money aspect kept me from giving it a perfect score of five stars.The fit for the camera is snug, and it manages to provide the camera's body with adequate protection without being bulky. It also resists scratches -- I've used mine for several weeks and have already traveled with it a great deal, and it still looks new (and thanks to the case, so does the camera). It even comes with a variety of carrying straps, assuring that at least one will suit your needs. It is obvious that a great deal of thought went into the case, just as it did the camera."
2,So very sexy,"All four stories in this book were excellently written, and as I read them, I could relate to the characters in each story. That is how I know I've read a wonderful book..when I can relate to the characters."
2,Kid Rock: You'll ROCK: buy this!,"Not just rockin' hard-core Rap. Turned out to be some really groovin' ballad type songs as well. The lyrics are excellent, the bass kicks, the back-up singers sweet, guests joining in (listen for Joe C) rock, an upset couple of answering messages (one from his mom)...this is HOT! Rock's here to stay! To Rock: Keep 'em coming, keep 'em tight"
2,Wonderful!,"I loved this book! It was so beautiful. I felt myself falling in love with Simon. He was an awesome character. Why can't real guys be like him? Zoe was a well structered character as well. She was a strong female lead. I was in tears at the end! I won't say anything to ruin the ending for people who want to read this! I hate when people do that. I'm sorry, but I do. If you are considering to read this, I suggest you do!"
1,Flex plate failure,I am running a Hays #12-040 on a Jegs 351W crate engine. I have ran 302 miles with about 20 starts on the engine. There are 7 teeth broken off of the starter ring. The plate does not seem to line up so that it uses the entire surface of the starter teeth. I guess I will look for an OEM and see if it will perform any better.
1,The most horrible movie of all time,"This movie is so bad that it does not deserve my time to even get into details but if some of you get a kick out of reading reviews of awful movies, you can enjoy some of the reviews by other unfortunate people who have seen this movie for one reason or another. All I can say is that the actors are a complete joke, the budget of the movie is not more than $1,000 and whoever directed this movie made a desperate attempt at creating a ""plot"" which after seeing 5 minutes of would make any decent director collapse from laughter. Bottom line is, unless you are on the verge of suicide and have nothing else better to do, avoid this movie at all costs."
1,"patronizing, fake sounding","This book is superficial and preachy. It is filled with stock answers and suggestions which turned me off and turned off the people I showed them to. It's hard to believe that teenagers would want to read beyond the first page.I also found the language elementary, and the grammar occasionally incorect. Answers to common questions were surfacy. This is a great title with very weak back up in the text. I work in a school as a counselor and have a teenage child, and I'd never give this book to anyone who really wanted the lowdown."
2,Takes your breath away!,"This is a series of breathtaking photos of the Andes range from the Caribbean to Patagonia. There are stunning photos of the mountains and heart-wrenching photos of earthquake survivors as well as many photos of everyday life. Mario Vargas Llosa, the famous Peruvian author, contributes ""inventions"" imagining subjects thoughts, feelings, attitudes and stories. This National Geographic book, photographed by Pablo Corral Vega, makes a wonderful tour of the majestic mountains and haunting coutryside of the Andes."
1,Inconsistent Screen Issues,"No matter what the outside condition of this monitor...production date as indicated on rearof unit was JULY 2003. This fact was never indicated in the description data! Had I beenaware of inconsistent screen issues (contrast varies from dark in center to light atthe outer edges), I would have NEVER made this purchase!"
1,cartridge,"I did not give a good rating on this product only because, it is generic. The delivery service was fast and the price was cheap. You get for what you pay for."
1,Completely Useless,The vibration unit only works if its inches away from the main unit (not 15 feet like the box says). I tried different batteries and even returned the unit for another one. The new one did the same thing. I tried contacting the first years via phone and email. Nobody EVER answers their phones and I got no response via email. POOR product and POOR service. Too bad because I think it's a good idea.
1,The Brain Eater Claims Another Victim,"An Ann Coulter screed thinly disguised as a science fiction novel. Proof of Louis B. Mayer's famous saying: ""If you want to send a message, call Western Union."""
2,If You Can't Make It To The Show,"It's been over 25 years since Frampton Comes Alive rocked the music world. And on this gem of a live CD he hasn't lost a step. The sound is electric, all the hits are here. And on the import double disc version you get an extra helping of Somethings Happening, Penny For Your Thoughts and the rockin I'll give You Money. If you haven't had the opportunity to see Peter live you'll want to check these discs out, and if you have you already know what I'm talking about. And you'll want this as a souvenir. This is the next best thing to sitting front row, so I strongly suggest you check it out."
2,good,"so far so good. its cheap. i have rayband but i prefer to wear this. this is all around eye protection specially on the beach, and i can swim with it."
1,BORING,"granted a very ""skilled"" guitarist but i cant appreciate the melodies the playing or anything about the songs. this cd [is bad]. maybe he should learn to not play the guitar. he doesnt seem to understand the concept of silence which is as crucial to a good song as the notes are. there will always be guitar players that rely on flash to win over an audience and this is definitely one of them. put this in the trash..."
2,Gain The Attention of Others!,"I read the author's previous book on managing stress, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I like it because it starts with a basic assumption - that it's harder and harder to get the attention of others because everyone else has so much competing for their attention - and builds upon that. I think the chapters are laid out in logical fashion. Some of the chapters didn't apply to me at all, so I just skipped them, but there's a lot else in the book that does apply, and so I thought it was worth while."
2,Great!,"I bought this monitor for my daughter, who had just given birth. I was wondering if she would have preferred a video monitor but then she told me that she was glad I hadn't got her one as there are privacy issues with video monitors. She absolutely loves it. It is very sensitive to sound, has a good range, remote lullabies, a star-show night-light and a microphone on the portable parents' unit to sooth the baby. She is very pleased and I am happy I made the right choice. They've had a slew of presents but she rates this monitor as the most indispensable."
1,Make sure you get the real thing,"The company that makes the highly rated version of this speaker is ""Pacific Rim Technologies"" but there are multiple cheap knockoffs of their design from companies like ""Pacific Image Electronics."" Make sure you're getting the real thing before you buy.You can buy the real thing for $19 from the Pacific Rim Technologies Web site and it includes an AC adapter. Those are great speakers for the money. The $5 knockoffs are junk."
2,THE MOST INCREDIBLE MOST BI-ZARRE VIDEO EVER!,"THIS VIDEO FREAKED ME OUT! A MASTERPIECE BEAUTIFULLY DIRECTED BY CHRIS CUNNINGHAM WHO DID VIDEOS FOR MADONNA AND LEFTFIELD. ALL THE LADIES' BODIES ARE SEXY BUT THOSE FACES---YOWCH! ALL DIGITALIZED FACES OF RICHARD JAMES A.K.A. APHEX TWIN. THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO OF THE DECADE-VERY FUNNY AND VERY ORIGINAL (...)I'M GLAD I DON'T HAVE MTV ANYMORE. THEY DON'T PLAY TECHNO VIDEOS AND DEFINITELY NOT THIS CLASSIC DUE TO SCENES OF SEXUALITY AND THE 1ST 4 MINUTES OF VERY DIRTY LANGUAGE (...). YOU MAY THINK IT'S A RAP VIDEO BUT AFTER 4 MINS, THE VIDEO GOES 360 DEGREES AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!"
1,"Not exactly durable, does the job.","I bought two of these cases a few years ago and since then they've begun to fall apart. The backing on one case came off and on the other, the front end is gone. As for being enclosures, they work and I can transfer my data, but they aren't very good looking. Being encased in metal with no fan is also bad, as there's no on/off switch like some of my other enclosures.All in all, if you're looking for a quick, dirty, and cheap solution, go ahead, but if you want something to match an aesthetic or be long lasting, I'd steer clear and invest in something a little better constructed."
1,Not at all a good value,"Rip off. Unless you have tons of money to spend and you've helped everybody and every cause you can, don't buy this. This perfume smells just ok. Nothing fantastic or memorable about it. And the price for the size.............ricidulous!"
1,This would have been a great toy if the coins didn't get stuck,"What a total waste of money. This toy would have been great if the coins didn't get stuck. I'm so mad I spent over $20 on something that broke within a few hours. There are 2 coins wedged in the toy that will not come out. I thought I might be able to dismantle the toy to get the coins out, but no, there is no way to do it! I highly recommend not to waste your money on this toy. I'm so disappointed. I deserve reimbursement."
1,Do not buy this book unless absolutely necessary.,"This book provides little in the way of explanation of how to do any of the problems at the end of the chapters. The drill problems do nothing to help the learning of the student. If you find a better Signals and Systems book, let me know."
1,ok but could be better,this game is unrealistic it takes like 5 sec in air to do a flip and is hard to grind and is stupid because u get a life line but fun for a wile then gets stupid
1,poorly made product,I purchased this table for my girls for christmas and the bolt has stripped on one of the legs
2,Essential for all the Bleepers Out there.,"Contains many truths. You will appreciate this book very much if you:1) Have seen ""What the Bleep We know"" movie2) Have been taking advanced yoga classes or other practicing any other discipline3) Have read any of Robert Anton Wilson's books4) Have favourited ""Matrix"" as one your all time best movies5) Have seen ""The Secret"" movie6) Have been a Cabbalist or a Free Mason7) Have been a Ideological Anarchist8) Have been a Theologian9) Have been a PhysicistMind into Matter is a book with many exotical ideas and interpetations (some sceptics may say convenient extrapolations) but it is an interesting backgorund for the things that may follow in the next years.One more book in your personal library of enlightment."
2,Benny and Joon DVD,This is a wonderful movie. It arrived within a few days in perfect condition and was packaged with care to the contents. We are very pleased and would recommend this seller.
1,Where are the great Christmas Specials?,"Disappointing. Fast forwarded through the entire thing and regreted spending my money. I also ordered and received the Donny and Marie Christmas Special. Though I wasn't asked to review it, don't order it. Far too wacky. Where are those wonderful Julie Andrews and John Denver Christmas Specials???"
1,"Not a Total Failure, But.....","Unfortunately I do not share in the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers. This record is the transition point between the classic Soft Machine and the humdrum new age Soft MAchine of the mid-late seventies. There are moments of brilliance but to compare this record to the likes of Third, Fourth or even Fifth is ludicrious at best. this is the beginning of a whole new band and a much different one at that. Without Wyatt and Ratledge taking a distinct backseat the entire feel of the record is ""safe"". With all the live issues out (from 69-72)and the the first 5 records also available theres no real reason to purchase this. My advice: avoid."
1,IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL PICTURES RELEASE !!!!,"THIS DVD LIKE SO MANY OTHERS RELATED TO THE SHAW BROTHERS COLLECTION, THAT ARE NOT RELEASED BY CELESTIAL PICTURES ARE A SHAM !!! I WILL NOT SUPPORT SOME LOW DOWN PIRATES LOOKING TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK !!! IF IT AIN'T A CELESTIAL RELEASE IT AIN'T WORTH A DIME !!!"
1,Stick to what you do best,"Carly does not presently have the voice for standards. Shepossibly could with retraining, but that would change the soundof her core repertoire that made her famous.The pieces are sung too low to show the nuancesand colors of standards. Then there are pitch problems. I'veloved Carly on her earlier music, and recommend she stick toher own genre and not try to cross over. For standards, I'drecommend Jane Monheit, and Queen Latifah's Dana Owens album."
1,Not as good as Fat Girl,"Bought this book after reading Fat Girl by the same author. This book is not as good in my view because it is really a loose collection of personal essays , supposedly around a food theme, but not all of them are about this theme. Some essays just don't belong. This makes me annoyed as I wonder if it's one of those things where the publisher says we need more stuff to fill up the book so they threw in random essays. Fat Girl, in contrast, is a short, sharp, focused book that gets its point across. I couldn't finish reading this one."
1,Do not waste your money.,"If I could have scored it at a minus number, I would have, especially for the price. My 1 cat just needed a taller litter box, but I trusted a friend who told me she has 3 cats & just takes it out once every week or two. Either we are totally different on a cleanliness level or hers version is better than what I bought. In her defense, she said she didn't have to put anything together. I did. I'm now cleaning out one heck of a mess every other day or two as the yuck goes through cracks in it and onto my floor. Wish I would have bought a way cheaper, simply taller box."
1,Practical but overpriced for what it is and does,It is NOT whole house and not worth the price you end up paying for it. They sucker you in with a promotion and then turn around and declare the value higher than what you actually paid so tgat you end up paying what you saved in duties and customs!Get ready to fight with it to get an interference free signal. I have yet to get anything but a static filled signal from it!
1,doesn't fit inside a 5 gallon bucket,"it doesn't fit inside a 5 gallon bucket. yes, it fits perfectly on top, but that means it slides off easily. it would be better if the top half had a diameter that prevents the entire sieve from going into the bucket and the bottom half had a diameter that fits inside a 5 gallon bucket."
2,The best,this judy garland box set is wounderfull it has songs i never heard before and i have over 20cds not includig the ones in my boxed sets. if anyone out there loves judy garland or has never heard her give it a try i like it maybe you will? So buy a cd that dosen't have so many songs or just sample some songs right here in amazon.com.
1,Yes Chip,What a joke! wish could get my money back plus some for the aggravation.They should remove the NO Chip from the label
1,It wouldn't play,"The Disc has some block on it from another country that it wouldn't play. So I have no review to give, since I could not use the product that I purchased. First time that has happened to me on E-bay."
1,Alternate Version of Slayers (season 1),"This series of books follows (as you'll find in book two) the story arc of the first season of Slayers, with a whole lot of minor changes here and there. The major problem with these books (besides being formatted for American readers but still containing some mis-panellings) is that the anime series is so vivaciously voiced and well-directed that it's difficult to stick the characters on flat paper and then read their words. The paper format works better for Lina & Naga where their adventures are really little more than cutting one-liners about discreet events on the way to a meal. Comparing the paper to the series, however, it falls short of giving us the long-running complex characters that the anime gives us."
2,good price,"Came fast and was shipped well. It does have a bleach like smell nasty, I put it into caps to get around smell"
1,Wont Play on PC,"I bought this game because of the high rating on Gamestop. When I got the game and loaded it everything was OK. When I tried to start a new game it quit running and a bug found window popped up and asked to send a bug report to the game maker. I sent the report twice and got a mailer daemon for undeliverable address. Some support!! There is another selection to play online which I did try and it ran fine and took me to a site for team type play. I do not play games of this type on the internet as my reflexes are not as fast as a twelve year olds anymore and there is too much cheating. I have since Googled the game and found that quite a few people have the same issue, it won't run. Some have got it to run with very techy work arounds but I am not that tech savy. I contacted the company via there website but have not received a reply.I guess it is buyer beware on this game, too bad because it looked like a good fps."
1,Harmless but Overrated,"The show is relatively harmless teen schlock, but in general I've found it to be quite overrated. Not bad television, but no where near as wonderful as it's generally purported to be.If you like teen angst, you'll enjoy it. If you are a stickler for details or you find yourself irritated by teenagers making pop-cult references to the 80s that are more indicative of a writing staff in their 30s and 40s than to anything actual teenagers would say, you'll probably find yourself annoyed.Not awful. Not great. But if you love WB teen soaps, it's probably right up your alley."
1,Looks great. Too bad it stopped working.,"These are great looking fans. Silent. They move the air around. I bought two from different sellers on Amazon. BOTH stopped working! The most recent was 9 months after purchase. The seller Del Mar was great. They're sending a new fan. Whew. Unfortunately I still have to pay an electrician to reinstall. I wouldn't buy another minka fan, which is too bad, since they look great. Just too much trouble to replace."
1,Still waiting,"I'm sure this will be a good product to have especially if you have a new mac power book that has NO 400 fire wire port,but I have not received it yet from the seller in the time frame that was estimated."
2,A required 80's RA disc,"Even without a bassist, Brother ""Ra's"" funky basslines swing hardcore.... A really tight-knit studio recording from the band in the eighties."
2,Awesome movie showcasing my fav Teen Titans!,A great movie to end the series. Very sad that the series had to end. I am hoping that all the series and this movie will be on bluray soon ...
1,No gender indication for Swedish nouns,"Indeed, this dictionary is quite useless for learning Swedish. Main flaw: no gender indication. Say, you want to translate ""an oak"". This dictionary won't give you a clue whether it is ""en ek"" or ""ett ek"". Also no plural forms are given. So for non-Swedish speakers, this is quite a waste of money."
1,NAKED and BAD,"So they are naked. That isn't enough to watch this thing. If you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies. SUGAR, GRANDE ECOLE and NEVERLAND (the gay themed Peter Pan - NOT the Johnny Depp movie!) are far more impressive. Even NEVERLAND's prison/bondage thing at the end with the lost boys tied up and in jail is sexier than this. Just because guys are naked doesn't make it hot."
1,Terrible Movie,I went out with a bunch of friends to see this movie and EVERY SINGLE PERSON HATED IT. I could not wait for it to end. Not a good buy!
1,not worth it,really not worth the money. although it is not expensive. It really just was not helpful to me. The company did ship it quickly and it was exactly as they promised.
1,Piece of crap,"Bought the 2GB micro sd card - it would only accept 663mb of data. Called for return authorization and they shipped another. Tried using this one, but computer would not recognize it when I put it in the card reader, using the adapter that makes it a full size SD card. Put it in another micro sd card adapter I had and now the computer recognizes it. However, this one only accepts 558 mb of its 2gb capacity. piece of crap. [...]."
1,Not Original Music,"It's almost ludicrous to see all the praise being heaped on Richard Rogers for his score to Victory at Sea since very little of the score is original music. I remember seeing an interview with Rogers sometime ago when he laughed at the idea that he could possibly have composed so much original music in such a short amount of time. He borrowed most liberally from Richard Wagner, with some of the themes for which he receives so much praise from other reviews at this site being lifted directly, note for note, from some of Wagner's Operas. Rogers main contribution was reshaping previously composed music to fit the various episodes and perhaps composing a few notes to transcend from one theme to another.What's so sad about undeserved praise is that Rogers was a truly great composer, perhaps the greatest ever on Broadway. But this time I think he'd be embarrassed to receive praise if he were in the company of other composers familiar with the classics."
1,Oh...My...God!,"Can't believe I actually finished this book. Could not find a single likeable character in the entire book, never mind realistic.Even ended up disliking the female character thoroughly and sympathizing with the ""bad guy"". All that stuff about Cody being so sweet(yuck!)... Not my idea of a sweet girl, she's just so shallow and dumb! After reading the book, I wouldn't mind tossing a rock at her myself."
1,Not the author's best work,"I give this book two stars for its excellent diction and a few amusing bits of description, but I find it painfully sentimental, like Shel Silverstein's ""The Giving Tree."" I have never understood why this story with its abstract ""The Boy"" protagonist is kept available while the same author's delightful masterpiece, ""Poor Cecco,"" is long out of print and valued by book dealers mainly for its wonderful Arthur Rackham illustrations. In contrast to the sadness of the Velveteen Rabbit, the tale of Poor Cecco the wooden dog, his fellow residents of the nursery toy cupboard, and an amusing cast of human and animal supporting characters - all with distinctive personalities - and their droll adventures at home and on the road, is a treasure replete with mystery, surprises, and an elegantly natural style. I was lucky to be given it as a child and wish others could be so fortunate."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money buying this kit. I bought it from another site on the internet. I bought it to make an ethernet cable for my boys' X-Box. It worked good on his cable. I made one more cable for a customer (I'm an electrical contractor), and it turned out fine. That was it!! I successfully made and tested 2 cables. After that, the crimper started destroying the ends, and as a result, the bad ends messed up the tester. I ended up buying a new crimper for over twice what this whole kit cost, and it's worth every penny. Also, the new crimper and ends that I bought were RJ45 EZ. With the EZ ends, the individual wires come out the front end of the connector so you can tell if you got them in the right order. The EZ crimper cuts off the excess wire as it is crimping. I will be purchasing a better tester, also."
2,Strider,"Slightly dated, jumping controls are not exactly the best, but still a must buy for anybody who owns a Genesis/Mega Drive."
2,Storm Surge,"I loved this book, and I loved Mick. The characters and setting were so realistically drawn that I almost expected to turn on the television and find reports of a category five hurricane or a murder investigation going on. I recommend reading the three books in order because they are closely tied in together. I LOVE this series, and Rene's books."
1,lemon-y goodness,"Two of the seven jars came broken, and after cooking yogurt (which, frankly, did not come out particularly deliciously), the second jar I opened broke as well. I am not a she-hulk, and I successfully use glasses and other fragile items each day without their shattering in my hands. However, this comes out to 3/7 of the jars breaking right away or almost right away. At this rate, I'll be lucky to get one more batch of yogurt out of this. I'm going to be returning this immediately."
1,no so much...,"I really dont use guides that often. My friend purchased this guide for me and it is really awful. Bad layout and small fonts fill this cheating device. POint less screen shots show awesome graphic but, you could play them game and see awesome graphics. if you buy this cheat guide you cheat your self. the idea is not to finish as fast as you can its to have and tons of fun. I used the wrong gun a enemy several times and each time i was dis membered. But as my limbs where ripped from my body on my computer animated me the real me was laughing my head. Dont get this. If you really want to cheat use the web you get it cheaper and theres not shipping involved"
2,RACHEL GIBSON HAS BEEN ADDED TO MY FAVORITE AUTHOR'S LIST,THIS BOOK WAS A GREAT FIRST EFFORT. I LIKED GEORGIE AND JOHN AND THOUGHT THAT MS. GIBSON DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF MOVING THE STORY ALONG. I ALSO LAUGHED QUITE A BIT WHICH WAS VERY REFRESHING. I HAVE OFFICIALLY ADDED RACHEL GIBSON TO MY LIST OF FAVORITE AUTHORS AND LOOK FORWARD TO HER NEXT WORK
2,Nice Harp,I like how these play. I am on my 3rd one now. I play a lot and I play pretty hard. But at $40 a pop I am not sure I can afford to keep going like this.
1,Same Bass Line Throughout the book,"I thought I would learn some very cool bass lines, but it was disappointing. Its mainly quarter notes in 4/4 time. The CD is awful to follow. It sounds like the same bass line with slight variations. There might be a couple bars here and there that I could use, but I got much better ideas from my piano teachers. I say invest the money in a lesson with a good pianist instead."
2,Pretty good... it entertain me on my 2 week trip,"I bought this to play on the play and in case if I get bore during my 2 week work trip to Asia. It kept me entertain the whole time.Three things I think it can improve on:1) I wish the AI was a bit more challenging if you keep playing. It seems the level of the AI is very level at medium.2) the graphics is not the best, but I can't complain since is on gameboy.3) the slider to increase the amount of money you want to raise is slow, you have to hold it down to make it speed up, but then it will pass your intended amount quickly. There is a button to go all in.I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.GL."
2,Top album,"To me, as a new fan, this is Thunder's best album. I like it from beginning to end and to me there are no fillers, just great songs from start to finish. I'm glad I had the chance opportunity to come across these guys on YouTube, and have since become a serious fan. May never get to see them live, but I'm glad to be able to hear their music - good solid hard rock with a bit of blues and funk thrown in for good fun. Even my wife likes them! Stand out tracks - title track and ""Andy Warhol Said"", and all the rest are pretty darn good as well."
1,"Don't buy it, waste of money","First of all, I couldn't even get this game to work properly. I have a high end system with a $400 video card and this game lags!! I can play Doom 3 on high settings but not a Tony Hawk game?Secondly, this game is way too easy even on the sick difficulty. Half the game was spent earning basic abilities like Manual and Spine Transfer and the rest of the time was spent trying to impress the local bums who give YOU money to do such simple things as Kickflips and 2000 point combos! Every once in a while you'll get a real mission to do but it usually something very simple and last all but 30 seconds. This whole game is beatable in two hours if you skip all the side missions and just do the main goals.Thirdly, classic mode is incredibly weak. There's only 6 levels! Beat that in one hour as well.In conclusion: If you must purchase this game buy a used copy. Get it for the PS2 or XBOX instead of PC because this one blows."
1,Horrible...,"My wife and I started watching this but gave up halfway through. The movie has no plot and no resemblance to Sherlock Holmes whatsoever. The real mystery here is why many of these reviews are positive. Probably because few of them have ever read any of the books. Elementary, my dear, Watson (which Holmes never actually says in any of the books) :-)"
1,Doesnt work,It works once out of every 10 times I press any button. Looks nice and solid but the connection between the remote and ipod is really crappy.
2,"Love this, works great and easy to use","Yes I had to read the manual and that made using this a breeze. Once you learn to set up the voltage that's it. I discharge the batteries first so it keeps more life in them and I'm only using this on Sanyo Eneloops, which are ok to fast charge.This is small enough to travel with, which is very important to me and it can handle world current 110-240v.I'm also using the adapters that convert to D cells. So far they work well on my older flashlights that I don't want to buy new D cells for.Overall this is easy to use and charges fast and that's what I need and it will charge 1-2-3 or 4 cells, another plus is not having to charge in pairs."
2,A little complicated?,"My mom said this was a little hard to figure out, compared to say monopoly.IDK it seems like they like it."
2,Nice bag,Great bag. It's roomy and colorful. Goes with so much stuff. Has three inside pockets which are handy. Definitely recommended.
2,Dear old friend gets her favorite book back again,"Wonderful, Thank you ! I ordered this for a dear friend of mine who had been missing it for years. She had leant out her own copy but never got it back and didn't want to ask for it. This is an elderly friend of mine who does not use computers. She described the looks of the cover - I searched for it and you had it ! - She was thrilled to receive her ""old lost book""."
1,Worked for 1 day,"The product was received in a timely manner. I was able to use it for one day ok, on the second day part of the screen went black and could not correct the problem so I returned it."
2,"Hot Chocolate, Everyones a Winner",Hot Chocolate is a fine group and I am waiting for my next purchase of their work. This CD is Primo and I play it every day. Thank you Hot Chocolate for fine work!
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this dutch oven. I opened the box and when I took off the cover of the oven there were already a few chips in the ceramic. I just sent it back and got a refund. I ended up spending more and getting one at Bed Bath and Beyond that was made in France and not in China. Hopefully, this one will last. It did not have any chips in the ceramic. It is not Le Creuset, but another company from France. Not as expensive as Le Creuset, but looks like as good quality."
1,kind of boring!,"i have only played this game once, but i really wanted to try a surfing game ... there is not much out there, i'd rather waste my time playing cod or halo ."
2,Favorite Buddy cd and the most fiery studio blues album!,The passion and outright blues savagery are unparalleled in any studio blues recording i have ever heard! I have actually shed a few tears while driving alone and getting sucked into the blues played here!
1,Disappointing,"The negatives other reviewers (e. g., bombadillo & John Dunn) mention are disturbing, but I was most put off by what seem to me to be ""dumb"" errors, the kind usually caused by pure carelessness. This caused concern for what errors might exist that are not obvious. On p.7, he lists a few of the ""more than two thousand well established, older neighborhoods"" that his friend and associate Jon Robbin , ""a Harvard-trained mathematician and a brilliant researcher"" found for him. One in the list is ""Fort Worth, Texas 75225."" NOT! 75225 is University Park, a Dallas suburb. On p. 243, in bold print, no less, he says there are 1317 millionaires who say a supportive spouse is important for every 55 who both have a spouse and say spouses are unimportant to wealth accumulation. He then says ""That leaves only 55 in 1317 who..."" If these are valid examples of his research and his logical process, we should not give great weight to his conclusions."
1,blown,bought 2 of these at a local wal mart store. maybe these bulbs were sub-standered but i doubt it. anyway the first one blew out about a day ago. the 30 watt coil blew with a big flash then a few hours later the 70 watt coil blew when i turned the lamp on leaving me in complete darkness. to top that off the other bulbs 30 watt coil started flickering. and just so you know these ge bulbs used to be good bulbs but now they are real bad
1,It's OK,"It's a decent album if you listen to the music but the lyrics suck! They SUCK! i can't believe Alice actually wrote any of these song except ""He's back"". That's a good song that deserves 5 stars but the rest of the album balances between 1 and 2..."
1,"This DVD should be called ""CRAPULA""",The WORST Dracula I have seen in a very long time. I would rather watch the 1970's Frankenstine vs Dracula then this garbage! If you really want the best movie find the masterpiece theatre Dracula by the BBC in 1979(?)Please don't waste your time with this stink bomb!!!!!
1,Crackpot...for cretins only,"Marvellous illustrations.Theologically Jack Chick is the Father Leonard Feeney, SJ, of the left-hand section of the intelligence distribution among Protestants.But Chick's is also the Henry Darger of comic books, and his worldview and eschatology even more bizarre. An idiot's Dante that makes Chick Faulkneresque.If Christianity is this simple, then why did the Apostles, who saw the Risen Lord, still not proclaim until Pentecost, and even then after that they argued? Chicks theology is Procrustean and lobotomized."
2,Great price/performance in a 4 inch speaker,"These are perfectly adequate 4 inch speakers.For what you pay, you get decent sound. Not the best, not the crispest, but certainly a great value."
2,nice product,I bought this product because I was having problems. Not a great solution but helps when you are on the go.
2,Great little book,"There are six pre-cut stencils in this sturdy little book from Dover. The pages are easy to remove, very durable, and clearly labeled. The designs themselves are great, bold and fascinating. I used them on a set of jars I had, and they came out beautifully. They make exotic containers for my collection of beads and marbles. The designs included are arctodus (a bear), smilodon (the sabre-tooth cat), mammuthus primigenius (a wooly mammoth), pilohippus (a type of horse), andrewsarchus (a type of wolf), and archaeotherium (which resembles a boar)."
1,This thing sucks! It's broken after 2-month gentle use ;(,"Exactly as what the previous reviewer said, the cheap glue-together flip stopped kissing each other after 2 months. This thing sucks!"
2,My mistake - not the size I wanted,"I use Aqua Velva regularly, but did not really want this size. I was looking for a smaller size to be used for travel. The fault is entirely mine."
2,freakin awsome,i love my new zune i can watch my videos listen to my favorite radio stations and show off my pictures. not to mention i have the special red edition so it sticks out. if you want a quality mp3 player and dont wanna be an ipod zombie get zune you wont regret it.
2,Great pictures and guide,Easy step by step instructions to producing a fly. It gives information that is both useful to beginners and advanced tyers
2,Great for extra help...,"With taking Geometry this year, I got stuck with a not so great teacher, and decided I needed extra help. We saw this product, and decided to purchase it. So far, it has great animated examples, quizzes, and tests. It also includes a ""game"" for when you pass a test with a good grade. This program contains eight discs starting at pre-algebra going up to calculus and also statistics, and ""real life math."" A great deal for brushing up or using for high school, like I am!"
2,Funniest ever!,"Mel Brooks is at his finest in this slapstick marvel. With Rick Moranis as Dark Helmet and John Candy as the lovable Barf, this movie excels in every detail. You won't stop laughing. I've seen it over and over again and I know I never will."
2,Great Book!,"Rawsome is great for beginners because it has tons of nutritional information that is thoroughly researched. The book doesn't feed you all the junk science many other recipe books do and it also has great recipes! This book is a great addition to everyones raw library. The book has a sprout chart for a guide, it also has a seasonal chart for when some vegetables and fruits are in season. This recipe book has references in the back so you can always go check out other books and websites. I found the information to be very beneficial. If you need a book with more than recipes and don't feel like reading tons of testimonials and junk science this book is for you!"
2,"It Blows, in a good way !!!",I use this to clean my D200 and lenses. It does a very good job of blowing of dust and fabrics. More powerful than the one I used to have.
1,NOT a 500 sheet tray,"This tray does not hold 500 sheets, not without jamming. You can only fill it up half way or else it will jam on every try. I have had this add on tray for 1 year and am very unhappy with it's performance. It will constantly jam (bad design, see my review for the T640 printer to learn more)."
2,So far these are top choice,"I lent one of the sockets to a neighbor (bad move right?)He had tried to use it to take off a stuck lug nut on his old beater.the wrench he had used (not the ones from the set)was bent like candy cane, the socket, not a scratch.so i hand him a wrench from this set. After some serious pulling, the lug came off and the wrench and socket are just fine.Now don't go taking lugs off with these but i was suprized to see the strength of this tool set, also the metric and standard open end wrench sets Denali sells are amazing .Top Choice"
2,Bottom line -- it works!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. After nearly 2 months of use, I'm a believer -- the volume of telemarketer calls is down dramatically.My only complaint is the cost. I'd think they'd do better selling it at $..."
1,Died after only three months,"It's been a long time since I bought an electronic appliance that failed in so short a time. And of course, returning it is more hassle that it's worth. FYI: piece of junk."
1,Adobe Limpness,"Photoshop is a pretty powerful tool, but it is undermined by its own supremely crappy print drivers. One piddling window with maybe four controls and NO PRINT PREVIEW! No print preview for a piece of imaging software (at this late date) is perhaps the stupidest idea since the first caveman chewed on a tigers tail because he was hungry. Seriously, without a decent set of print drivers, you might as well try to alter your photos with a crayon and an iron. Idiocy. Unforgivable.Even Adobe's own Illustrator has a robust Print controls window."
1,P. U.,"Loved Dawn/Day of the Dead. I even loved Zombie. I greatly looked forward to Zombie 3. But this movie was ATROCIOUS. One minute you have the traditional slow moving zombie, next minute they are jumping of roofs and talking! No plot. No continuity. This movie was just plain bad. Stay away from this steaming pile of crap"
1,this thing crashed my windows,"I installed this device and when I rebooted, my Windows was NEVER able to run again. I had to reinstall EVERYTHING. This is truly a piece of junk. Wasted hours and hours of my life. And now I'm not using it. Yeah, really good deal. I paid big bucks so that I can not use it and have it trash everything. Genuine garbage."
2,Great Product! Must have for Fussy babies!,"This is a great product recommended by our friends who are ""veteran"" parents! I was skeptical at first about soothing aid that helps to put babies to bed - but it works wonderfully on my fussy 3 months old baby boy! It takes a while for the soother to work and he seems to be crying less and less during bedtime when he hears the music and sees the light. I should have started to use the product when he's younger! It will even be easier to condition him that ""now pooh is on - it is bedtime!"" I am also using it at naptime, and just purchase a ceiling soothing projector as part of our bedtime routine. Hope that will work too! I highly recommend the Pooh Soother to any parents who are starting to sleep train their babies!"
1,.........,what was going through sonnenfelds head when he filmed the third act of this thing? It looks like they cut alot of stuff out of it at for the final.The only thing worth rembering is that glimpse of salma hayeks butt.
1,"great, until the seal on the lid fails","I got 4 of these jars based on the reviews and a 4 for 3 Amazon deal, and they were perfect for about 5 months, until 2 of the 4 lids lost their ability to hold steam and heat."
2,Excellent,Kept my interest the whole time. I wanted to finish to see what happened to the key characters. Enjoyable and a good read
2,"A Good, Different Film","This is my first review here on Amazon, so what does that tell you? This is one of my favourite films. I first watched Buffalo '66 having no idea what it was about, or what genre of movie it belonged to. I've seen this movie around 15 times, and I can't decide whether it is a comedy, drama, romance, all three? Anyways, it is one of those movies with a great twist in the end and many quotable lines. I can't say enough about this film. Just check it out, it is different. We all need different. Good different, too."
1,Just OK,I thought this one was long in getting the stroy moving along then cameto a pretty abrupt ending.
1,Charlie and the Great Glass Elevetor by Roald Dahl,"I ordered two copies of Charlie and the Glass Elevator, Spanish Version, from two different vendors and I got it in English. I tried to contact vendor but it was difficult to contact them."
1,beware of revision B4,"with revision B4, D-link apparently claims to have gotten rid of the necessity to enter a security code during the installation. sounds great in theory, however, once installed, I get repeated error messages 'valid security code not found'. the drivers on the CD are the same version as the most recent ones from the D-link site, so no solution from there. uninstalling, restarting, reinstalling, all day long wouldn't help. calling D-link tech support wouldn't help either, they seemed to know less than I.as much as i hate to give bad reviews, this is really completely unacceptable. i'm going to return the DBT-120 and give the competition a try."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"We actually registered for this item before our daughter was born and finally when she was old enough to use it, she totally freaked out. The music and the noise level totally scared her. The little nobs and things you can pull on are also not very interesting so even when we turned the music off, she was not interested in playing with it at all. We had some other kids come over to our house and they don't like it either, so it's not just our kid that doesn't like it. We are trying to figure out a way to get rid of it now..."
2,Intense,"I think that this album can be summed up in one word: Intense. Its a great album. I think Nsync realizes that the sound of the music world is changing, and they're changing along with it, but unlike many other acts, they're taking their fans with them. You can still hear the vocals of the group, and the harmonies are still there to be heard with sounds of two-step and electronica in the backround. The men of Nsync have definitly changed since their self titled debut album- but its a change for the better. Some people are looking for a follow up to their sophomore album No Strings Attached, but this isnt it. This is a whole new sound for them, but it completely works for the better. I, personally, love the song Gone(written by justin timberlake and wade robinson) and The Two Of Us. In Gone Justins voice is perfectly pitched and has a soulful blue-sy sound to it. and in The Two Of Us, the groups harmonies are perfectly set. I think this album will be another record-breaker."
2,Its lonely sometimes in the fastlane! - Lindsay Lohan,"Honestly I really loved this movie. It was cute, girlie and funny. The cast was amazing of course the beautiful Lindsay Lohan, Chris Pine, Samarie Armstrong and Bree Turner. The movie is about a happy go lucky girl named Ashley who takes everything for granted. Jake is a bad luck, gets all the wrong stuff in life and kisses Ashley at a masquerade and looses her luck. So Ashley has to find her luck back before it ruins her life. So... I will let you watch the movie to see what else happends. Trust me this is a very funny movie even though the movie got low ratings I still reccommend it. :-)♥Cassie"
2,This is a great collection.,"Arcade perfect ports of Mercs, Final Fight, Forgotten World, Ghouls & Ghosts, Bionic Commando, Street fighter 2 & many more. I would've paid over $20 just for an arcade perfect port of Final Fight or Mercs. We finally have it & it will cost us less then $1.Many great games on this collection. 22 games from Capcom, just wow!This is the second best collection in the market today, only bested by Taito Legends. Don't waste your money on the Midway or Namco collections. If you want to get a real great collection, then get this Capcom Classics collection or my favorite the Taito Legends collection. You will get over 50 games between these 2 collection & most of these games are great, not like some of the other collections I can name."
1,Does not keep hot for very long,"I was hoping this would keep my tea hot for the morning, but just Luke warm after an hour. I use it for loose leaf tea. A lot of the leaves go thru the sides of the mesh. I also have problems with the cover leaking when pouring."
2,Didn't know how much I loved them until I got this album...,"Ernie and Bert have some of the best music on Sesame Street, and this album is the place to find it. It not only includes the standards ""Rubber Duckie"" and ""Doin the Pidgeon,"" but there are some terrific songs that were new to me: an incredible lullaby incorporating deep breathing; ""Up Goes the Castle"" and a fun song about asking for help; ""Lonesome Joan."" This CD should have a place in any Sesame Street fan's collection, be they 2 feet or 7 feet tall."
2,"if not now, when?","Rebeccasreads highly recommends SAY SOMETHING as an important picture book with something to say!It's one thing to notice how your schoolmates get along, which ones are always alone, & who is always teased. It's quite another thing to be on the receiving end. So what do you do? Do you do anything?SAY SOMETHING urges you, in scene after scene, to become aware, to test your courage, to step forward & do unto others as you would have them do unto you, especially when teasers & taunters are looking for a bit of put-down fun."
2,old favorites still the best,"Great game for any kid over 5, easy to learn , easy to create new versions, only drawback is stones break easy, wish they included some extras"
2,A mix of old favorites and new music.,"This album contains some fresh updates of some old favorites along with some new songs. It has a decidedly country twang, but is none the less refreshing for those of us who aren't primarly country fans. My favorites are the old hits Walk Away Renee, Hooked On A Feeling,and It's In His Kiss. Patsy Cline fans will love Vonda's rendition of You belong to me.This is one CD that isn't going to collect dust on my shelf."
2,LOVE!!,I have two of these- One for inside and one for the patio. I have a 70lb pit bull with joint issues and he loves it!! The only thing I've noticed is that my dog don't like laying on them without covering them with a blanket or towel. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!!
2,Love it! Great buy!,"My husband put this on his bike for my one year old, they both love it! My son couldn't stop smiling. I love that he can see everything my husband can and I know that he does too. We bike around town everynight, getting compliments from everyone that passes by. It's a MUST buy![[ASIN:B000FIH0EG WeeRide Kangaroo Child Bike Seat]"
1,Crane not real. Cheap toy. Falls apart easily.,I was looking for an inexpensive construction toy for my 3 year old son. This looked like a fun play set but it is a little lame. The crane falls apart when you spin it because it does not clear the back of the set. I thought the crane would move up and down but it has plastic 'ropes' that are fixed and do not move. The ramps detach when you move it. The wrecking ball knocks down the blue shed easily but too easily for my taste. Makes for a high mom/dad maintenance requirement to reset it over and over. The die cast trucks are what you would expect for the price. I expected the toy to be a little on the flimsy side since it was inexpensive I just wish the crane really worked and it held together better.
2,Damages-A must read!,"B.K. Bazhe is an eloquent writer, whose style reveals the heart of an artist and a poet.Damages in an amazing story, that is, at times, raw, gritty, painful and yet, hauntingly beautiful.Its an epic tale, told with skill, a unique style and most importantly, soul.I recommend this book to anyone seeking a story that will linger, long after the last page is read."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have had this phone for almost a year now. I'm having all the same problems as everybody else. The display is fading - almost illegible - and the beeping noises are incredibly annoying. It also has very annoying ring tones. You have to be sure to set the ring tone on the same tone for every phone and the base or else there's a *horrible* cacophony every time the phone rings. This phone never had good voice quality. Every time I talk to someone on it people tell me they can barely hear me, and I can hear an echo which makes communication very frustrating. Since I got this phone, I have used my cell phone SO much more than I ever did before. Yeah, this was an inexpensive phone, but you get what you pay for. This is just a cheap piece of junk, not a great deal. I would rather pay a little more money for something that will work well."
1,0 Star Presentation of a 5 Star Movie; Sony/Image Lied,"This is apropos of the DVD version. This movie is pan and scan, despite what the description says and what it says on the back of the box. It is 1.33:1 format and even says at the beginning of the film: ""This film has been modified from its original format-It has been formatted to fit this screen."" If you got stung, demand a refund. What nitwit would release a film in an obsolete format?"
1,I really tried to like this book,"I read 185 painstaking pages and just had to stop. I didn't really care about the characters. The plot was so jumpy. Characters were introduced so randomly that it was hard to keep them apart.DaVinci code style, my eye! It's this summer's garage sale fodder!"
1,Stopped working after 1 day,"Worked alright for the first day, but today it just made a high-pitched whine without light, then stopped working all together. I'd return it but HDE charges a $2.99 s/h fee since the shipping was free. Add 2.99 to a few bucks for return shipping and the return costs more than to just keep it. Won't buy from HDE again. Word to the wise - check the return policy on all non-Amazon.com purchases."
1,returned,I returned it. It was broken when I received it. I was very unhappy with the return process trying to get a return # was very difficult and felt like I was imposing on the staff. I have bought many things on the site and have never had to return anything. I ended up getting one from the Keurig web site (of couse it cost a little bit more). Your welcome to call me on my cell @ 520-820-2790.
1,"Excellent for RCX, not so good for NXT","I bought this book to teach students to program their NXTs using Java as the next level above NXT-G. As I began using the book, I came to realize that many examples and explanations were written for the RCX. The few that existed for the NXT did not seem to work or were not as well explained. I am still using the book for ideas but this book is not helping me as much as I expected."
1,colony,Boring is the only word I can use to describe this book. I am usually a big fan of the author; but not this time. It just goes on and on and on and on. Do you get the picture. I have about 100 pages to go of this over 600 page book and I can not wait to finish it. I have seriously thought of tossing it; but I have too many nights invested in reading it and I am usually a fast reader. There is so much happening with this family it is difficult to believe. Each generation has horrible things happen. I really keep hoping it will improve---- maybe maybe ?? I dont think so ! anyway that is what I think of the Colony.
1,crack!,"the belt cracked after just a few weeks use. It still works months later, but it's cracked up on the back."
1,thumbs down,"This book is written for people showing in Britain. It is not particularly helpful for those that show in the US. The author is in a unique position that is really unrealistic for most of us, e.g. her husband built her trailer. Her idea of a shoestring is quite a bit different from mine!"
1,HD DVD,"SCAMMER! I received the DVD's and they were clearly opened and had been resealed. The writing was even slanted and it was obvious these were knock off's and or already opened. I contacted the seller, he told me to return the items and he'd return the purchase price MINUS the shipping, which was about twice the price of the items.I did that, with USPS delivery confirmation. He then avoided me for OVER A MONTH and NEVER REFUNDED ME! So I was out the items, shipping, and return shipping out of my pocket! Thankfully Amazon reimbursed me for the purchase price plus shipping but BEWARE! This was my worst experience on Amazon, Ebay, you name it."
1,chocolate fountain does not work,"The chocolate fountain would not bring the chocolate up through the fountain. We followed the trouble shooting tips, but it would not work. It was a huge dissappointment."
2,"Gripping plot, fast pace, believable characters.","I thought this was a great book--suspenseful, plenty of twists and turns, and a very likeable and complex protagonist in Molly Cates. It cracks me up that other reviewers complained that the ending is far-fetched. This is what the mystery genre is--if the butler didn't do it we'd be disappointed! Highly recommended."
2,UNFORGIVEN,This was a wonderful read for someone who enjoys historical romances. I had trouble putting it down. A story of an outlaw and a rancher's daughter who fall in love and face more obstacles than they can endure. Or can they! Read this wonderful story and see what happens. You can't miss with this one.
2,great documents,"This book is put together well; the documents are in a good order that helps give the reader an overview of the Great Awakening. As a Christian, the documents are inspiring and interesting because some of them give a glimpse of people who were fervent for and enjoying the Lord. The freshness of their contact with the Lord as seen in these primary sources is similar to our fresh experiences of the Lord today!"
1,ipod touch has too many problems,"This is one of the most amazing electronic gadgets yet conceived. Sadly it's not ready for prime time. There are too many problems. I had two of them and both had major issues. One had a bad screen and the other wouldn't load. As far as I'm concerned two tries with a product is enough. Hey Apple, next time you release a product you may want to be sure the majority of them work properly. Especially as $399 a pop."
1,read this,yo was up every 1. i think that you should stop listening to Nas and start listening to Tupac. \ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \/ \/est Cost
2,good performance when you are sitting straight to the receiver,good performance when you are sitting straight to the receiver.i needed a wireless mouse and kb to use with my mac mini.Earlier i used kensington's but that didnt work good.This worked good.Minor problem with it is that you have be sitting straight to the receiver.
1,garbage,"One of the lamest, most boring, dreary, plotless pilesof shallow trash ever to insult the name of Dr.Who. Give methe Peter Davsion era anyday,or the Pertwee era for that matter.Heck, Hartnell was better than this! This is up there with theSensorites for boring ""so what"" value. It's pap! What's more the superficial mish mash of time travelers who decide to dress up as The Phantom of the Opera and Fu Manchu for no apparent reason are only moderately less pointless and silly that the totally out of character Doctor who has decided to dress up as Sherlock Holmes and start babbling about ""elementary"" etc, like he's swallowed the complete works of Conana Doyle. I suppose if Tom Baker had put on a dress and started acting like Miss Marple, that also would have been acceptable? This just looks a bit less stupid, but scrape away the ""style"" and the substance is just as rank!"
2,Good.,"its a fun game, but a little confusing at first but then you get the hang of it. graphics i feel could of been a lot better. i consider it a hassle to aim the gun every time you play or having to set up the infrared sensors. The gun is not cordless whitch was not appealing, together with the gun color(bright orange). other than that is a fun game to play."
2,Great fun and a great value,"This is the perfect size for a smaller space and ideal for our 2-year old. She loves the fact that her coloring books and papers can be hung with the clip as she ""paints"" on the easel. Converting to the desk is also a flash (she does it herself) and there is ample storage for art supplies as well as papers and coloring books. We haven't used the dry-erase board yet but assume it will work well.The only thing to be aware of is the fact that the bottom legs of the desk as well as the stool as slick plastic. They would work fine on carpet but we had to place some non-slip furniture pads on the bottoms to keep everything from sliding on our tile and hardwood floors. Overall, this is an excellent item."
1,Drum is junk!,"My son reieved this tumbler as a birthday gift in November. Just finished the first round of rocks and the drum has a hole in it...... I could see after time the plastic drum wearing thin, but this was the first set of rocks! I would not recommend buying this product!"
1,"Great frame, but no longer any service","This is an awesome frame, but there is only one problem...the StoryBox network which is required in order to send pictures via the internet is no longer accepting registrations of new frames. I recently purchased one for my mother only to find out she cant register it and thus cant use it.The amazing thing is that no one tells you this. Even storybox.com doesnt tell you until you got to register a new frame (see for your self!!!). Storybox tells you that they are no longer accepting registrations and to contact Kodak for a refund. Save yourself the hassle and dont buy this.I can not belive Kodak, StoryBox.com, and all of the retailers are still promoting a product that obviously has no future and can no longer be used with the Intenet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Worse than King Arthur,"KOH is about as interesting as watching paint set. It is quite possibly one of the worst epics ever made. Considering that this is a Ridley Scott movie one has to beg the question - what on Earth did he think he was doing? Since the early 1990s Hollywood has been evading a movie about the Crusades... and now we can see why. An English blacksmith turns out to be the heir of a Jerusalem Knight and goes off there to find himself, only to replace his father and serve the King of Jerusalem who is having a hard time maintaining law and order in his own house while Muslims are knocking down his doors. Plotless, pointless and utterly boring, the fight sequences have been seen so many times before that you will just sleep your way into the end credits... and what a three hour nap it will be. For all the big names on display this really does leave much to be desired. Forget Gladiator or Troy. This one is clearly a no-brainer."
2,one of the best of Hooker's CDs,"This CD has many songs that stick in your mind but, the title cut is one I can listen to over and over. It is almost an anthem to me and my friends. I guarantee once you listen, you'll feel the same!"
2,hard drive,"I had to rebuild an old Dell computer and wasn't sure if it would work or not. I took a chance and decided to try to find another hard drive on amazon.com. For the price, it was well worth the effort. Item I purchased worked great. Many thanks."
2,"Good Book, Bad Presentation","I found this book quite a delightful read. It is full of universal truths regarding love and learning; however, I find it quite apalling that the University of New Mexico Press would represent this book as a true story. It is especially disturbing to me that this book is being read to young school children who will most likely take it to be true. I am particulary distressed about the fact that Carter writes about Cherokee beliefs which are not Cherokee beliefs at all. I think this book is great for adults who are willing to investigate the history of the author and the beliefs of the Cherokee; however, I feel that it is not appropriate for children."
2,WE HAVE MISSED THEM,"Pussycat was one of my favourite groups in late 1970s. I was quite excited when I heard that this new CD would be released by late May 2000. It is a great collection and no doubt a nostalgic taste. Especially ""Mississippi"" will take many people back to the good old days of 1970s. Thanks for releasing this CD."
2,Among the best,"Hannah Whitall Smith is among the great classical Christian writers. It was a blessing to find the book,""The God Of All Comfort"" The contents 1.Why This Book Has Been Written 2.What Is His Name? 3.The God Of Al Comfort 4.The Lord Our Shepherd 5.He Spake To Them Of The Father 6.Jehova 7.""The Lord Is Good"" 8.The Lord Our Dwelling Place 9.Much More Versus Much Less 10.Self-Examination 11.Things That Cannot Be Shaken 12.A Word To The Wavering Ones 13.Discouragement 14.The Shout Of Faith 15.Thanksgiving Versus Complaining 16.Conformed To The Image Of Christ 17.God Is Enough"
1,impossible to overlook the flaws in this horrible adaptation,Obviously an unfinished work which should never have been released to the public. Horrible animation! I imagine that everyone who was involved in this project are all groaning because of the new attention it is receiving and wishing that whatever money grubbers decided to release this in DVD just to ride the wave of Peter Jackson's success had thought better of it. You should get paid to watch this.
2,Beautiful Love,"I really enjoyed this book. The more I read, the more I couldn't put down my ebook. I loved the story and especially loved the ending. This book takes me back in time to my youth. Loved it!!"
1,This one is Very Bad,"After listening to the CD many times, this long-time Westerberg/Replacements fan has reached a conclusion about it: It is horrible. The new material does not rock, and the songwriting is some of the weakest Westerberg has ever produced. In the past, Westerberg demonstrated that you could have great songwriting and still Rock. This time around we learn that Paul can also write some weak, mellow songs."
2,Meg,I ordered this dvd on a Monday evening and received it on Wednesday! It was super speedy service and the description was the same as the product. Thanks.
1,Dangerous! Lacing hooks nearly killed me on ladder!,"Nice comfortable shoes but I have had trouble with the lacing hooks catching on things. Once I had one catch on the side of a ladder I was coming down (TALL ladder) and nearly got killed or at least hurt. Replace the hooks with a better system and they'd be a great shoe, as is I consider them dangerous."
2,Daughter Enjoys,"My daughter has learned a lot from this read, it is informative and talks about rules of the game as well as moves."
2,Cuts crusty bread great,"Cuts hard and crusty bread without crushing it. It is big -- if you have room for storage it is great that it is big -- one long pull and your are through the toughest crust and complete with your slice. My other knives are very expensive (Global and such). I got this because of reviews that said you can never really sharpen your serrated knives like you can other knives. I've had my $150 bread knife sharpened professionally several times. It gets sharper but not like new. My expensive old bread knife could not get sharp enough to handle super crusty bread. So, I got this Victorinox expecting to replace it in five or so years if and when it gets too dull. I had forgotten how nice a real sharp bread knife can be until I used this one last night. This should become a go-to knife whenever a serrated edge is needed.BTW, in spite of the low price, it looks great hanging with my other knives."
2,"Very funny, very sad, very thought provoking","While I could have some major issues with this series, for example, terrible language, off color, unfriendly to religion in general and my denomination in particular. I found myself really hooked after watching a single episode on the sci-fi channel, so I had to buy both seasons to watch after the family has gone to sleep. My wife doesn't share my enthusiasm, and I wouldn't want my kids still at home to watch, due to the afore mentioned concerns.So what is the appeal to me then?For one thing it is wonderfully acted, with razor sharp wit in the dialogue. But mostly it is a thoughtful, and unique look at the importance of not wasting your life... That is a good reminder for us all."
1,How to waste 30 bucks for nothing,"When I first saw this game I was attracted by how much it was hyped. ADVANCED AI!!!!! THREE DECKS!!!!!!!!!!! MORE OPPONENTS!!!!!!!! Don't be fooled. The AI was beyond advanced. It would pump up a monster, then sacrifice it for a weaker one. You'd find a much better opponent in a four year old. I would have usually been excited for more opponents, but here they just wasted my time. You need to duel someone over and over to unlock someone else. It just gets old. When I beat the final opponent I felt like chucking this game out the window. I am not risking my money by buying another yu gi oh game. EVER AGAIN"
2,OMG Its about time!,"My boys have been wanting the Oddessey on dvd forever, and its only been found on old VHS. Why the wait for dvd?"
1,Tasteless and pathetic,"A little too much graphic sex and too little romance. I am a romance writer and definetly no prude but there's a fine line between vulgar and tasteful. This story is just plain vulgar. It's like Penny Jordan couldn't find anything else for the characters to do so she just writes a lot of smut until Julia gets knocked up and Silas admits he loves her. The gist I also got from this story is that they're distant relatives, grossness! Plus Silas is egotistical and way too pushy. There's nothing wrong with being a modern day girl who enjoys sex but Julia just sounds like a sl*t instead of a likable heroine. Want a better read with tasteful sex scenes? Then read Fugitive Fiancee by Kristin Gabriel or Father by Choice by M.J. Rodgers or the Wedding Planners trilogy by Darcy Maguire. They're written better without a lot of smut like this book!"
1,Was not as described,"Granted I paid very little for this, as you they say you get what you pay for. But after receiving it, I found pages where misses, about 6 pages? Was disapointed. Had I known it was in this condition I would've had bought it anyway based on the very low price but would've liked the heads up on actual condition. Thank fully I'm creative and could fill in the pages and my toddler doesn't care."
1,Warning!,"Warning! I love Fun Fun but I never buy CD's from Hot Productions anymore. They both look and sound cheap. It's known among music fans that the sound quality is awful on their CD's, so stay away from them!"
1,One Problem,"This is a very good summary of the current state of Biblical archeology, with nice diagrams and pictures. But I am a bit of a maverick and I kept asking myself as I read it: ""yes, but what if the chronology is wrong? What if the Exodus occurred in 1450 BC as the Old Testament states and what if that was at the end of the 13th Dynasty rather than the middle of the 18th?"" Then all of the problems in Dever's book would not exist. Do yourself a favor and check out ""New Chronology"" or ""Synchronized Chronology."" Dever acts like it doesn't exist."
2,Hysterically funny and heartwarming,Dawn French shines as the lovable Vicar of a small pastoral village in England. The quirky townsfolk are each unique and very funny in their own way. It made my whole family laugh out loud! A pleasure to watch again and again!
2,Great tea accessory,It is a great little tea ball. I use it all the time as cannot stand a taste of paper from teabags in my tea.
2,That's So Me!,Who can't in their late 20's early 30's relate to Bridget? I loved her....I am her...she's me...it's so now! Looking for light and laughable...don't pass this up!!
1,"Racing on freeways, what fun is that?!","I thought this game deserves one star because the gameplay is fu***** cheap. The only race mode is race on the freeway, it gats real old, real fast. The only thing I find fun is the ways you can customize your car, but that is pretty much it.Also this game does not deserve to be $25, it should be free."
2,Levi's 550 Relaxed Fit Stretch Dark Jeans,The item came from Amazon in great time and in good condishion. Size was right on the money and first rate condishion overall. The one thing I found with this pair of pants is that they are made to ride to low in the frong and back. If I still had the body I had in my youth then no problem. What happens is they keep working their way down and I have to keep pulling them back up. Outside of that they are a good product for the money.
2,Perfect Cup to Warm you,"This is my favorite cup of tea when it's cold. The smell of it as it infuses is so spicy and delicious. I love to enjoy it any time of day, but especially before bedtime. It is an herbal tea, so there is no caffein or actual tea in it. It has cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, carob, chicory, black pepper, Chinese star anise, cloves and cassia oil. All those warm spices make for a luxurious tea. If I'm feeling under the weather, this is what I like to sip."
2,Bizarre in the best way!,"This is such a strange performance piece. The Alexandrov Russian Army ensemble is a great surprise in that they seem to ""get"" what is going on. As the Cowboys stated in an interview, they were all musicians just in different uniforms so everybody got it in short order. Musicianship is very good. Makes one frustrated they virtually never never seen in America.The extras are amusing. The additional videos of their more recent material are on their own almost worth the price. Leningrad, Where's the Moon, and Jupiter Calling are twists from a twisted band. My favorite though is Happy Being Miserable which is so descriptive of people I know, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry."
2,FF9p First and best review,"I can say buy it now or you wil regret for the rest of your life. If you haven't heard any FF song, this`s a good start. This CD contain most kind of music, from classical music to death metal( or at least-hard rock). The end. Review:really short and really compact."
2,Corny and funny,"For all fans of the first Singles Ward, this movie will keep you laughing again. My 4 teenagers love this movie and cannot watch it enough. It's very corny but does make us laugh over and over!"
2,Gloriously Glorious!,"I bought this title as I do not yet own a DVD player - GASP! and cannot get my hands on Dress to Kill (DVD only). I very much enjoy Eddie Izzard's humor and his delivery is to die for! His brain must whirr along at the speed of light! As an Anglophile, Izzard's references to all that is British is great fun and a decidely delightful change of pace. I am carried away by his wit and charm and love his interpretation of the Bible to take us down, albeit ancient history, memory lane! His use of profanity is minimal compared to other modern comedians, so most audiences will tolerate him quite nicely. Eddie's a load of fun and I can't wait til I can get my hands on his latest romp into hilarity."
1,Buyer beware,"This product was a real disappointment, because the base is not long enough to provide any lateral support, and my neck feels very unstable when I use this on a carpeted floor. I doubt that I will ever use it again. Unfortunately, it cannot be returned, so I suggest that you try a demo at a Relax the Back Store before you buy it. For a product that provides a relaxing neck cradle in a much more effective manner, I suggest a foam pillow in the shape of a half-cylinder."
2,An excellent look at a complex story,"I thought this movie summed up the overall concerns and issues associated with teaching evolution in public schools very well. It really gives you insights into the players and personalities on each side. It's also an excellent look into the background on the teaching of evolution, including such gems as the Scopes Monkey trial and the(now debunked) Haeckel's drawings.Highly recommended for anyone interested in this issue."
2,K&N The Best,K&N makes the best filters you can get I have used them in cars and motorcycles for years. I got this for a 1994 4 Runner and has made a great SUV better. I went from 11 MPG in town to 15.5 MPG have not done a road test.
2,Fianlly,"Been looking for this album for a while and finally got it. Well worth the wait. I like all the songs. Excellent guitar work, surprised he's not in a band with someone, but, that's his choice and I respect that."
1,This is edited don't you get it?,"When I heard time life was releasing these videos, I was so happy. However, when I got them, I realized that they were edited. They are completely different from the original HBO series. All of the hip hop once played, has been replaced with elevator music. There is no way anyone can critique these videos without viewing the original series. I think it was dumb on HBO's part to sell the rights to time life. I guess it is all about what sells' rather than authenticity. Do not but it if you were a true fan because you will be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not 6 ft long,"The quality is great for the price, but it is hardly 6 feet long, more like 4. Very disappointed with the length."
1,Lawsuit ?,"Does this album have or does this album NOT have any affiliation with Anggun? The name certainly appears pirated, with just a ""-fall"" added to Anggun's mega-hit ""Snow on the Sahara"". Certainly Ms. Cole cannot expect us to believe that that is just a COINCIDENCE!I notice a few people here stating that she sings Anggun's song. Well, the song which Amazon has on its link as ""Snowfall on the Sahara"", and the song which she sang on Leno under the same name, is definitely **NOT** the Anggun song. So what on EARTH are you guys talking about?I do not have the CD (I had to check a star to post), but if someone who does could post here or email me whether or not Anggun's name is listed anywhere on it (such as ""Composer:"" for the title song), I'd be most curious.Otherwise, I imagine there is a lawsuit going on over this name....?"
2,Fabulous!,"Normally a hard-nosed reader, ""Beach Music"" left me in tears.Pat Conroy's breathtaking command of the English language and awesome character development continue to leave me in slack-jawed awe. He consistently produces America's finest novels. A 10-Star rating should be added just for him."
1,Scary movie - even scarier game,"The only scary thing about this game is that you paid to play it. If Hollywood put as little effort into its movies as game companies put into the adaptations, people would watch re-runs of ""Suddenly Susan"" and stay home."
2,O'Brien's Biography on JFK is Excellent,This book on Kennedy is very well written and extremely informative. The details on his professional and personal life are intense. I highly recommend this book.
2,Well built puppet stand,This puppet stand is just what I was looking for. It holds a good number of puppets in a small space. The price was right also.
1,Scratch this one off your list!,Frustrating and disappointing. Coating is difficult to scratch off without tearing paper. Plastic parts are flimsy. Read several on-line consumer reviews if you are considering purchasing this item.
2,A good place to start....,Shunryu Suzuki's book is clearly one of the most significant pieces of writing about zen to hit western audiences. He has a very down to earth approach to his writing - it is very clear what he is saying and he is always quick to try to minimize misunderstanding and misinterpretation. His emphasis is on practice - and not on any specefic techniques - which is refreshing in this day and age when there are so many books flooding the market that employ a certain way or technique. Along with that other famous Suzuki (Daisetz T.) Shunryu was one of the most successful writers on zen.
2,"Um, okay","I am a visual learner and the examples/instructions on how to create the hairstyles featured in this book were hard for me to follow since the pictures are in black and white. The somewhat detailed descriptions on how to create the hairstyles were helpful - yet, I still believe this book would have been of greater help if the pics were in color. I was disappointed that there weren't any hair models featured with short hair."
2,Beyond Memory,"It always seems to be what Nintendo finally did, other smaller companies did for Nintendo's Gamecube awhile ago. With Nintendo's Memory card 1019, it carries much more memory than it previous 251 memory block card. This device seems to be more crucial than imaginative, especially for die hard gamers of the Nintendo Gamecube. The memory works very well, and the trust that Nintendo carries on this card is great. Although with all different kinds of memory cards available for the Gamecube at all different prices, many will stick with cheaper memory cards that aren't always safe for Gamecube owners. Try to stick with Nintendo and this memory card, or the cheaper 251 block memory card. You really won't be sorry.Overall: B+Value: B"
1,This is not a soundtrack album,"If there were actually pieces of music from the real movie here instead of all these lame pop songs I would have gladly bought the CD. Thanks to on-line forums like this, I didn't even waste my time trying to buy it."
2,Feel good romantic comedy with interesting twist,"I ended up picking this movie while playing hookie from work one day. Jason Segel is a hit or miss actor, which kept me from watching this movie any other time. But i kept an open mind as I was eager and desperate for a good romantic comedy. Turns out, This is just what my fictitious doctor doctor ordered! It was refreshing to have a romantic comedy be unpredictable and yet relative to modern day relationship issues. of course they were a few over the top moments, but with a strong supporting cast it kept Segel grounded making for a true feel good romantic comedy."
1,"Absolute crap, cheapest quality",Don't buy this. The quality is abysmal. It WILL leak in a month or two and you will be forced to buy a new one.Garbage.
2,Clang Rose - Composed By Sandy Lam,"This is an album that Sandy herself considers ""experimental"" in the sense that it has substantial techno influences. The title track, ""Clang Rose"" is composed by Sandy and it is a very unique song, with a somewhat country-rock arrangement. All of the songs are easy listening, and some of the songs' arrangements are just.... amazingly complex~! Highly recommend Tracks 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10."
2,Planet Earth is a magnificent production to watch,"Planet Earth uses spectacular photography and narrative to take you to places never before seen. The five disc set documents the beauty and fragility of our planet earth. Cinematography is stunning, and the content is daunting, beautiful and foreboding about the future of our earth and all it's inhabitants."
2,Worth a second read!,"I absolutely LOVE to read, I've read too many books to count, but never have I read the same book twice.. except for kissed by an angel, it's THAT good! You have to read it to believe it. Then maybe a second time after that!"
1,AWFUL!,"What a major bomb of a movie. How can a cast with so much talent produce such an awful movie! How can a movie with Bill Murray and Ben Stiller not make me laugh? Owen Wilson was especially disapointing as ""Chaz"", the black sheep of an otherwise dysfunctional family. Gene Hackman's recent streak of disapointing movies continued with his awful performance as ""Royal"", the father of this family of losers. Hackman's recent efforts include Behind Enemy Lines,Heist, and that box office smash Heartbreakers. What actualy was Danny Glover's role in this movie? He was completely out of place in this film. Glover should convince paramount pictures to make Lethal Weapon 4.This way maybe he can save his faltering career. In conclusion, the only positive thing that I can say about this movie is that it ran a little under two hours. Please don't waste your time and money on this movie."
2,A is for Alibi by Sue Grafton,"Loved this book. The main character follows through the whole series, but the books can also stand alone. I have all the letters including the current one which is V. I had read this book several years ago and loaned it out, but it was never returned, so I decided to buy it again to have the complete series. I read it again when I received it and enjoyed it as much as the first time I read it."
1,Is this MUSIC?????????,This is the worst crap I have ever heard - just noodlings and noise - what a load of bollocks!!
2,Stat,"I found this book very useful, not just for people in health professions or women. Lots of useful information and real-life examples. The best book on assertiveness I've read."
2,Best Ever,"I originally bought this compilation from a pawn show in 1993. Despite the terrible cover, I hoped the songs would be worth listening too. Turns out, this is one of the best surf albums I've ever heard with a few of the cuts being featured in the movie Pulp Fiction. I listened to it so much it eventually became scratched beyond all recognition and I am really happy to have found another copy. This is a must have for true surf fans."
1,Beware of sparks.,"When I first got them last year they were great as advertised. Inexpensive, light, quiet and dried hair fairly fast but in 6 months one of them shorted and sparks flew out. Then last week the same thing happened to the other one. Definitely not recommended. This is cheaply made and dangerous."
2,I feel great,Asked doctor not to give my antibiotics for uri. He suggested olive leaf extract. He uses it everyday a doesn't get sick. It took a while to get over the uri but I feel great now. Still taking it...
1,for new age music fans,"As much as I like some of Jon's music, I mostly appreciate his lyrics. This album totally disappointed me. It's just another new age album, to me plain boring. I'll stick to ""toltec"" and what he did with Vangelis, most of which I find extraordinary."
2,It worked.,I had deer coming in and using the licking branch and scrape I made and have photos to prove it.
2,Required reading for preachers,"I require my homiletics students to read this book. Not only does the author offer approaches, ideas and stories to nudge their imaginations, but she also models a way of reflecting on ministry that has honestry and integrity. One of my students suggested that this book should be required reading for seminarians BEFORE they begin their studies. I think that the book is so on target that it would appeal to preachers at any stage of experience."
1,"Horrible and seriously, what was the point?","I'm open-minded and come from a punk background. I kept waiting for this movie to get better and hoping for some kind of plot to wrap my head around. I personally thought neither came to fruition. Most of the music was awesome and was a reprieve from the rest of the movie. I am sad that I lost 2 hours of my life watching this pointless movie. As far as the music, I'll just put on my T-Rex and Bowie CDs and enjoy those instead."
2,A must for motorcycle use,"Easy hook-up with a line fuse built-in. Don't understand why Garmin saw fit to add a connector for the audio that you have to still get an adapter for. It's too small for a headphones or line out plug-in. I just use the one on the GPS itself. Other than that, great. And it works for multiple GPS's of that range, not just the 2610. My 2730 and the 2820 also use the same multi-pin slide on interface."
2,Very Good -- But Plot Spoiler Review,"PLOT SPOILER!This film is not a classic, but it is worth watching to see Robert Redford & Faye Dunnaway in their primes.The story line is good until the very ending -- then it yields to the paranoia of the times (1975): Big Government & the CIA controls everything, even the New York Times.A better ending would have been to re-write Redford's ""random"" choosing of Dunnaway's apartment to hideout. Make it less random, and more ""accidental"". Then in the end we discover that it is not her apartment, but a ""safe house"" and she has been sent to kill him (unbeknownst to the first assassin, Max Von Sydow).That final layer of excitement -- two assassins out to kill him -- which one saves him? Or not?"
1,Beware,"I purchased the Power 2000 charger with 8 AA NiMH batteries. New out of the box only 7 of the 8 batteries would charge up. 3 of them checked on a battery tester after charging overnight showed only 80% capacity. Very disappointing. After spending $70 from a store that does not accept returns on batteries. VidPro wants $8.95 to return the defective battery. I did not purchase these on Amazon, wish I had because Jersey Camera sold me 4 for $25 and Amazon lists the same batteries 4 for $5."
2,Born the size of a jelly bean...interesting koala facts,"Children will learn that koalas are marsupials, not bears, and that they live in eucalyptus trees and love to eat the leaves. The powerful koala jaws have 30 teeth for chewing and they can eat more than a pound of leaves per day. Descriptions of the physical characteristics and the behavior of koalas are matched to clear, crisp color photographs. Young children will understand and enjoy this informative and attractive book."
1,crap,Just plan poor quality. I opened the box and drill bits were all over the place. The case broke 10 min after I opened it. The drill were bits sharpened incorrectly.
2,Incredible,"Let me start by saying that I'm not a big fan of Green Day. Sure, they've had a few songs that I really like. The only other CD I own by them is Dookie, which I really like.I have to say that when I first heard the title track on the radio it grabbed my attention. After reading a few reviews on here I went out and bought this disc. I do not regret it for a minute. This CD is EXCELLENT. The songs, production, lyrics, music, guitar riffs, etc are top notch. This is probably the best CD I've purchased this year.If you are even considering getting this; go out and get it now.If you're not considering it, you should. You'll be missing out on a great CD."
1,Broken without ability to repair,"I used my Oster to blend frozen smoothies. It worked okay. It would eventually get the ice and frozen fruit to blend, but it required a lot of stopping and stirring. It was really loud (but most blenders are). After about 5-6 months of smoothie making, the shaft/axel that goes from the motor to the blades sheered off. As far as I can tell, Oster doesn't sell replacement parts for that problem."
2,Great album!,"I have had this cd for years! I came across it on someone's Maynard list, and thought I should tell you how good it is. Yes, as you can tell all the songs are covered, but better than any cover I have ever heard. Great buy, by far!"
1,BBBOOOORRING!,"Why one star? Easy... Sam Neill. If it weren't for him, I think it would have been 1/2 star! Of course, what little part he DID have he did well. The movie was too slow for my taste, but that was only part of the problem. There really wasn't much in the way of ""horse whispering"", and I felt not enough time was focused on the object of the movie's premise... the injured girl AND horse. The relationship between Redford's character, and Ann also brought up some ethical questions. While yes, she did choose her husband over Redford, the fact remains that she did some things that I find questionable. She returns and that's that. Perhaps my beliefs got in the way of a movie that so many find appealing, but even aside from that, I thought it was terribly slow, and not something I wish to view again. Did I mention it's good for insomnia?"
2,SanDisk 1 GB Card works great!,I used this card in a recent trip to China and it worked perfectly. I recommend it highly.
1,Too strong for me,"I was surprised to see how highly rated Burberry is on Amazon. Received it as a gift and of course tried it on right away. I was displeased with the fragrance -- found it too heavy for my taste. Waited about 20 minutes and re-checked - it did not lighten very much and I still did not like it. In my opinion, it was too spicy, strong, and heavy.That being said, I don't wear it often; but surprisingly I get compliments nearly every time I wear it. I've come to believe it's just so strong people can't help but notice it... it's either that or my perennial allergies have distorted my sense of smell."
1,Not a good experience,"Hadn't had a pair of 501s in a long time, was tired of cheap, thin ""jeans"", want some good old Levi's denim... I don't know what these are, but they sure aren't denim... about half the thickness of what I remember Levi's being... The stitching looks cheap... I may or may not buy something with the Levi's brand on it again, but I'll never buy jeans online again. ""Made in Haiti""; seriously?"
1,Not what I expected,"The Bushing hole is not a standard porter Cable bushing size, which I did not gleen from the product discription. It is well made and was readily installed, however, not suited as is for the application I purchased it for .... now I'll have to purchase special bushings .... or not, I may just give up and use a standard router."
1,very disappointed,"tried to find this cd for a long time, after ordering & receiving it...I put cd on to play and high road to china song came on first, but after that it seemed to not have all the music I thought it should, not even close...very disappointed....not amazon's fault but the sellers."
2,Broody and Tender,"Tim Story is one of those arists ill-served by identification with the ""New Age"" genre, His previous two releases (Beguiled and The Perfect Flaw) are insinuating, wry, ambiguous and haunting. You can imagine Satie writing similar music were he alive today. Story's music is often pictorial also; it conjures images, and produces a feeling of fascination although it is superficially very simple. The newest recording Shadowplay is more definitely melancholy, even sorrowful. What prevents it from being just-plain-sad is its compassion. It is musically somewhat simpler than its recent predeccesors, more atmospheric but perhaps a little less intriguing. It is, I should add, very pretty but not at all saccharine. If you like Tim Story - and I do - this music will please you. I'm left feeling itchy to hear what he'll do next."
2,"Beautiful, well crafted, but not without its problems","This passport holder is very well made. The leather is beautiful and has a very soft feel. However, there are two things you should be aware of.First, even though in the product description it states that the fabric inside may not be what is pictured, I was surprised with what I recieved. The material inside my passport holder was plain brown - and while not taking away from the beauty of the product it definitely does not add to it like the fabric in the item description.Second, the size of this passport holder is much larger than the size of a US passport. My passport will fit in any of several pockets, none of which seem to be particularly intended for that purpose.Overall, this is a very nice product. The look and craftsmanship are excellent, but be aware of the above points"
2,I must have been missing something...,"Cady was not so detestable after all--I realized that she just really, REALLY didn't want to experience once again the hunger that had once taken over her body. She was naive and thought she was in love with Aaron Samuels, the former significant other of Regina George, until the end, when she finally realized that she DID love Aaron herself...and I really felt for her.A timeless story and a great movie that I will hopefully soon be adding to my video collection, MEAN GIRLS is a cinematic masterpiece on nearly every level."
2,I really like these...,"...they look like men's socks should, good old fashioned ribbed hose (I am not of fan of plain socks for men and certainly not sheers socks, they look hose for women). These have a comforting old style appeal with a nice mix of contempary colours (they go with just about any outfit!)They are made well of good quality fabric whcih won't let you get uncomfortably hot or cold. And the price is very good. They last a long time too!"
1,Does Letterman Have this in His CD collection?,"Don't WASTE your time Buying this CRAPPY CD. Leave it to the REAL Performers Behind these great hits. Better yet, Get the NOW or Totally Hits compilation CDs instead!"
1,Don't Bother!,"This book was AWFUL. The worst part is that I hung in there until the very end, for some reason thinking that it would pull together into a good story. But it was a bad joke, and poorly written at that. The author appears to have some uncanny talent for writing about incredible things by sucking the life out of them until they are not emotionally moving in the least. The characters were poorly developed and unlikable. The references to mIRC and ""haXXors"" were just plain STUPID. I could perhaps see the story appealing to a preteen, but there's too much inappropriate X-rated trash in this book for that to be a good thing."
1,Not happy,Why do people lie to say its a swing set when it was only hardware????? Its a scam!!!! Im not happy person!!! I want my money back!They need to make sure to tell coustemers that THATS ONLY HARDWARE and that is all it is!
1,What we have learned about making poor arguement,"If you want to learn how to make broad vacuous claims then this book is for you. The argument made by this author about science were without substance or logic. He goes so far as to claim that the very content of science is a social product. If you think that this is true then go read the book, you deserve it."
2,It's a hoot!,"The Last of the Blonde bombshells has tremendous star power as well as a tender plot which takes one back to WWII as well as modern times. I find it a ""feel-good movie"" that can be watched and enjoyed more than once!"
1,chef's skillet,Unfortunately I did not review the dimensions on this item and thought It was a wok type pan. I returned it.
1,Needs a Warning Label,"This book should carry a warning label that lets you know it's a 230-page infomercial for the Kabbalah Center. It contains little that hasn't been regurgitated from ""Rabbi"" Berg's work, and what little doesn't come from him comes from fundamentalist Christians like Bob Larsen. The author's credibility is also damaged in its own right by lapses such as placing Pirke Avot in the Talmud, when in fact there's no Gemara for Pirke Avot, so it's only found in the Mishna. I was bitterly disappointed with the book."
2,A Must Read for any woman considering having children,"As a practicioner of Oriental medicine and specializing in fertility issues for American couples, I have this book in my clinic and recommend it to all my patients. Even in the busy, career oriented lives of my patients, they seem to immediately connect with this book of ancient wisdom surrounding the issue of conception. Since they are all experiencing infertility, this wonderfully written book offers up an entirely new perspective and insights into arenas that we in the West tend to overlook.The author, Seligson, has no idea of how helpful this book has been to hundreds of women with infertility and an behalf of all my patients, we thank him for taking the time to write it."
1,Dogs miss there Four Paws toothpast.,"The reviews sounded great on this item, however I knew the only review that matters is that of my bubbies. So far, after a couple of weeks, they are still not thrilled with it. They used to come to the bathroom and wait to have their teeth brushed, now I must play hide and seek with them."
2,A brilliant tool and a tip how to clean it,"This brush is brilliant. It doesn't ruin your grate like other steel brushes does (this one is not made of steel/iron). So it'll save you the frustration of buying a new grate because the other rusts.Heres a tip on how to clean it. Mix a bowl of warm water with wash machine soap or a tab. Leave the head of the brush in the water overnight and behold - almost as good as new. Over time the wood/handle near the head will lose its protection, but rather that than an ugly brush :-)"
1,Don't listen to the audio version!!,"I'm writing this review for anyone who might be thinking about listening to the audio version. It is the worst audiobook to which I've listened! The reader poorly conveyed emotion of the characters in conversation, sometimes, I think, messing up what was actually being said. What was worse was trying to figure out who was actually speaking since all characters had the same accent, voice, and expression. I'm really disappointed that I didn't actually read this book...I think it would have been a decent suspense read!"
1,Perhaps the most misleading book on ethics ever.,"A famous and influential book that is almost entirely wrong on every count. This book set philosophical ethics off in the wrong direction for over 60 years. The combination of non-naturalism and intuitionism makes ethics actually quite impossible. But do not despair, Moore's famous argument against the so-called naturalistic fallacy is just so many pages of begging the question. Of historical interest only."
2,ibookreview,"The Apple iBook I purchased from Amazon was the best purchase that I made.I was considering buuying a new one from Wal Mart, but came accross the used i Books from Amazon and decided to purchase 2 of them. One is still working good, the other one had a problem."
2,short stories are better than novella,"If you like the style of McInerney, then I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying the paperback or a used version of this book. I would just skip the title and read the short stories. Some of them are up there with Carver!-Borden Burns"
1,Italians can't rap,"NEFFA proves that Italians do not understand the true essence of hip-hop. The group is nothing more than a pathetic refugee camp of wack unemployed greasy Italian MC's and a couple of American stragglers who couldn't find work back in the States. As far as their so-called beats are concerned, they lack flava and spirit. These punks make Vanilla Ice look like Rakim. These toys can't even get no respect in their own home country. Florence, Venice, and Rome have no love for NEFFA. If you want the really dope s***, then go to Amsterdam, where it's always all good. Check out MC Spliff, Sir Smokes-A-Lot, or the Bong Squad (aka the Hash Pipe All-Stars). Peace Out and Word to the Gods."
1,Died in less than a week,I never write reviews but this one bothered me. I bought this for my fish tank lighting and in less than a week the timer stop turning. Since it's in a dry place that never sees the light of day it makes no sense at all.Junk.
1,Defective upon arrival,"One of the fans simply would not turn on. Defective, so it only gets 1 star. Maybe most are fine, but I'm rating my unit only. Back it goes!9/9/2007 8:38 am- Update: Antonline, the seller of this product, has so far only replied to my refund request with an auto-generated ""send it back to the manufacturer for warranty service"" email. This is unacceptable. I've sent another email demanding a refund, but I'm getting a bad feeling about Antonline. I'll update this post again in a couple of days either with a positive outcome or a ""buyers beware"" warning."
2,no lumps no clumps PERFECT EVERYTIME,"This product mixes well and does not overpower the fruits/vegs I add to make a great healthy protein drink. I love the vanilla flavor. The creamy texture is an added bonus. Mix frozen strawberries in to make a ""ice cream texture"" treat and eat with a spoon."
1,anti-bark spray,"I was disappointed when I read ALL the directions that this spray will only stop the dog from barking when he wears the collar. As soon as you take the collar off, the barking with resume. Since I have a small dog, and the spray container is very large and bulky, I have not used the product. I do not wish the dog to wear it forever."
2,"Holy Sleuthing, Batman, it's Harry Potter!!!!","A thoroughly enjoyable HP sleuth effort. I read the entire extant HP corpus 5 times last year (I AM NOT obsessed!) But this little gem made want to read OotP again. I missed many clues, apparently! This one goes into my permanent library for re-reading after the new HP 6 is read! WWP SCORES A PERFECT 10!"
2,"A beautiful, passionate masterpiece.","My hat is off to Ry Cooder for bringing together such a wonderful collection of talent in a single place and point in time. Each piece has its own individual feeling and spirit, and all are enchanting in their own way. It's rare to find an album with so many special tracks; this album is a wonderful compliment to the amazing ""Introducing...Ruben Gonzales"""
2,Fun Movie,"This is a cute, smart, and entertaining animated movie. It's good for adults as well as kids, although not really young kids. The animation is very life-like. Definitely worth seeing."
2,Amazing,It was a very good book so excited to read the rest of the series. I hope the characters evolve
2,A Gamer's Must !,"Whether playing MMO's online or a standalone flight sim... the logitech trackman marble series is by far the best there is! The ability to do anything with a slight move of the thumb makes games where controll, timing, and speed much easier; and the cordless feature is an added bonus! I've never regretted using a trackman marble and keep a spare one around at all times."
1,Dr. Beth is WRONG,"FYI- I based my purchase decision largely upon the review listed above. Foolishly. This griddle is NOT reversible, so you cannot do pancakes etc. It is a rangetop GRILL, nothing griddle about."
2,Sexbomb... INDEED!!!,"I've always loved Linnea Quigley's stuff, and she was super hot in this, but this was the first time I've had the pleasure of seeing Delia Sheppard in a movie, and she is HOT. I mean REALLY hot. Not just her perfect features, but also her snooty material girl attitude had me drooling... but that could be my medication. Anyway, those are the main two reasons (or four reasons, depending on what you're counting) to see the movie, and it does have that purposely cheesy 80's quality that's always good for a laugh, and the plotline's even pretty clever.I first read about this movie in an expose for Linnea Quigley in a shortlived Fangoria-era magazine named Slaughter House. I've looked for it ever since and this is the first release of it I've EVER seen. I've looked for bootlegs and everything, so thanks for digging this one up, Media Blasters."
1,not comprehensive enough,"I bought this book before I was pregnant. While it helped me understand the basics of pregnancy, I didn't get the answers I was looking for after my conception. This book is good in informing you about what you should do or not do, but it doesn't explain the causes of why it happens."
1,A book inside the box...,"I won't award this book one star for the same reason that I rarely offer five. Both are reserved for exceptional representations of the class good or bad, and if there is one thing this book isn't, it's exceptional. It's not exceptionally well written, not exceptionally appropriate, not exceptionally good, not exceptionally bad... in a word, it's quite unexceptional.It's a cute re-hash of the same tired think-outside-of-the-boxisms we've all heard for years, only this time, there's some cheese and a bunch of anthopomorphized rodentia serving as the principle characters. There is a subtle irony in writing a book about change that's fundamentally indistinguishable from all other books about change that seems to be completely lost on the author. Trust me, if you're not a complete halfwit, you've experienced change your whole life, and there is nothing new that this book has to offer, really. Not even a new allegory...."
2,"Very Engaging, Well Told","An enjoyable coming of age/coming out story, told in a folksy, believable first person style. I can see the comparison to Catcher in the Rye.It's not genius, but there will be very few who won't empathize with the teenage angst that lies close to the surface (and sometimes pokes out)."
1,at least it was better than the first!!!!!,"not as good as i thought it would be.Not very good effects,same as the first.It did have a different storyline and better ending than the first.Only if you liked the first!!"
2,pretty darn good.,"This was a lot better than I had even hoped for,you forget you are looking at a small screen after only a few minutes as the quality is so good and I was amazed at the sound as a couple of reviews had said it could be poor.Controls take some getting used to as they are so small but not an impossability to use.Overall I loved it."
1,Very Disapointed,"Fine keyboard, exactly what I expected. I was replacing a similar keyboard where the letters had worn off the keys. Guess what? Withing six months an even worse problem (letters wearing off on the keys)with this keyboard! NOT recommended!!"
1,NOT SIZED CORRECTLY AND TOO NARROW,They should sell these to women. They are way too narrow and they are at least a half size to a whole size too small in length. I should have listened to other reviewers. I bought a pair for me and my dad and even sizing up a half size they were too small. Now I have to pay return shipping for a product that was never constructed correctly to begin with. Buyer beware. Note that these cannot be worn if they are too small because the back has a lip and it would definitely cause a blister if your heel extends out over the back of the slipper.
2,A Good Sucessor to the Slim Shady LP,"This CD is excellent. The Marshall Mathers LP is much more entertaining than the Slim Shady LP because the beats improved and also the lyrical content was made much more interesting. This is one of the first cd's where I can play the whole thing through without having to skip that many tracks. If you are an EMinem fan or even a hard-core rap fan this cd will probably be a good buy for you, but if strong language offends you, you might want to listen to it the first time with open ears. Once again this is a great rap cd."
2,Good basic floor mats at low price,Needed a pair of floor mats for a 95 Del Sol I recently bought which didn't have any floor mats. These floor mats met my needs at a low price and looked good in a red car with black interior.
2,Great little coffee maker,I am the only one in the household who drinks coffee. My little 4 cup maker was getting a little worn and dirty. At work I had a single cup press device that looked great but made the worst cup of coffee. I bought 2 of the Black and Decker Brew'n Go makers and am very happy with them. Easy to use and clean and makes a decent single cup of coffee.
2,Good book for experienced professionals,Good book. In my opinion should only be used as a review book before the exam. There are some missing topics like WINS Node types.
1,"This is no ""Ruthless By Law "" substitution","I just got this album the other day & it's not even in the same league as any of RBL's albums or even Hitman's. The beats are nothing but recycled scraps from Lesson 2 B Learned, Ruthless by Law, & Solo Creep. Black C's production is evidant on this album, but it is wack. N.O.H. Mafia's flow sounds like a dumb@ss imitation of Black C & Mr. Cee. There's not one decent cut on this album, let alone good. IF YOUR A FAN OF RBL POSSE, HITMAN, CELLSKI, OR AN OTHER BAY AREA RAPPER - DON'T GET THIS ALBUM."
1,Handle detaches at top,I bought this coffee maker just a few months ago and now with a full pot of coffee the handle detaches at the top. This is a disaster waiting to happen. So far no one has been burned but I can not recommend anyone buy this carafe. Checking online I have found others with this problem and they report no help from the company.
1,Strange album,"It's not o typical Van Halen album. After one year listening to it, I must say I didn't like it. Hope Sammy or D. Coverdale helps Van Halen return to the great days. I just think if Coverdale enter in Van Halen, the band had to change the name, maybe to Coverdale - Van Halen, because Van Halen is gone without Sammy or Dave. It's part of history of music."
1,"Nice, but...",The inside divider literally broke within the first day of use. Overall though it is a good value for the price but severely lacking if you need long term use.
1,Guess I'm #3 to recomend the new Fozzy CD instead!,Do yourself a favor and do as other reviewers are saying and check out the new Fozzy All That Remains Reloaded. It's absolutely incredible.All That Remains Reloaded (W/Dvd)
1,2010 Char-Broil Bust!!!,"Had this grill for three years. It worked great until summer 2009. Thermostat burned and melted where it connects to broiler element. Char-broil customer service gladly sold me a new one - total with shipping $60.00. First time I plugged it in - which was 2 months after I received it - it melted and burned just like the first. Char-broil customer service wanted to sell me another since their parts only have a 30 day warranty. As a one time good deal customer service sent me a replacement with free return shipping of the newly burned out controller. This replacement of the replacement burned and melted just as the other two had done. However, now Char-broil won't return phone calls and ignores my emails. No response to three emails and three phone calls. Don't buy this Char-broil electric grill. It was a good product two years ago but the 2009 and later components are defective and cheap. Find a different brand. I am going to Weber grills."
2,"Great product, best at Amazon for the money","I purchased this for my grandson to take to college, it is great looking and very roomy. I especially like the zippered bottom with bottles included to keep shampoo, etc. My husband said this one was nicer that the one he had years ago when he entered the Army. If he doesn't lose it I know this will last him for many years to come. Do not hesitate to purchase this Dopp Jumbo kit, it is perfect, heavy duty zipper and carrying strap."
2,"Soft, silky sheets at a bargain price!","I bought a set of these sheets in Ivory and washed per the instructions - cold water, low heat dry. They are the most comfortable sheets we've owned - very soft and silky. The fitted sheet is large enough to accommodate a 14"" thick mattress plus a 2 1/2"" memory foam pad.Excellent product at an excellent price!"
1,NOT REALLY WHAT I WANTED OR NEEDED,"I have been working with gourds for quite a few years now, something like over thirty. There was very little in this work I found to be useful. I am sorry to say I agree fully with another reviewer here who was less delighted with this particular work that probably I am. I did give it two stars simply for effort though. I strongly suggest you search further as there are quite a large number of books out there that are of better quality and certainly more worth the money spent."
1,Really bad product,This piece of junk of a water pic never worked right.The adjustment on the stength of the water pressure never worked.It's on full blast all the time!The contraption is so loud that it sounds like a jack hammer.
2,Very enjoyable,"Michael White is a Producer of stage and screen, and in this light and breezy book he offers his own take on his career, flops and triumphs. He is never harsh on anyone but himself, and details his rise from aspiring writer to Impresario. White has been associated with some of the most popular and notorious entertainments of the 20th century; ""The Rocky Horror Show"", ""Oh Calcutta!"", the London production of ""A Chorus Line"" and Andrew Lloyd Webber ill-fated ""Jeeves"". The book concludes with his forthcoming film ""White Mischief"" of 1984."
2,great for whole family,"I loved this book - it was so well laid out & the images are so appealing. My daughter (& husband!) & I have had a lot of fun trying the different techniques. My daughter particularily loved the fish rubbings, as did the cat! A great book for those interested in creative projects & who want more than the usual parenting magasine projects"
1,Did Not Work,"This stuff didn't work at all, I haven't even bothered finishing it. I just use my epilator without anything now. I'd rather use nothing than use something that doesn't work. It feels a little greasy too, which don't like."
2,One of 311s Best Albums,"311 has always come out with some incredible CDs over the years, but the new CD ""Evolver"" could possible be their best. The single ""Creatures"" off this CD is the best song on the radio right now! The entire album is jam packed with outstanding songs. This is one of those rare Albums that someone can actually listen to the entire CD the whole way through and enjoy every song. There is the harder 311 music with a few relaxing songs that make this Cd wonderful. IT is worth every penny!"
1,"you'll get tired of it, save your counter space, money,time","This thing is like any new toy that is fun for a while but after the novelty wears off it's way too much of a pain to keep doing. After you use the juicer there are about seven parts to clean. You must first disassemble the thing and clean all the parts and I was shocked at the reality of what a pain it is based on other reviews. And really it can be messy. On the positives, it really does extract a lot of juice from the fruit and the juice is very good. The pulp does not have a lot of wasted juice in it, almost none. I've had mine for about three months now and I feel my enthusiasm waning. I think it will soon find a rather indefinate place next to our bread maker on the shelf of unused appliances."
1,Like a bad sequel,"I felt at the end of this book like I felt after seeing Indiana Jones and Crystal Skull. Bad idea, never should have done it! To say that this is book is as bad as Indiana Jones 4 is a little too harsh, but there are many similarities. The plot of this book is not nearly as innovative as the first two and the characters become much less vibrant than the first two. The ending is just awful, unsatisfying, and self indulgent for the author. Its like he's trying to say something significant, but its totally a lost cause. The ""full cycle"" part of the book is also trite and mechanical.All in all, I recommend stopping with the Silver Hand."
2,beautiful and functional,I have always wanted a professional quality roaster and didn't think too long about this when Amazon put it on special. The quality of this piece was obvious as soon as I opened the box. It is so elegant! I used it the first time yesterday to bake a smoked ham. My husband agrees that it is the best ham I've ever cooked (been cooking with good reviews for 40+ years!). Cleaned up easily to brand new appearance. I would love to find a smaller comparable version simply because then I could use it more often. Can't wait to have a chance to show it off to company!
2,Metal-Machine Music,"A quartet of projects spun from King Crimson, the music explores the vast avenues of ideas and virtuosi of Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew, Bill Bruford, Tony Levin, Trey Gunn and Pat Mastelotto.Bruford is a rhythmic wonder on ProjeKct One - Live at the Jazz Cafe, while Belew adds a twist or two on V-drums, and the ego of an arena-rock headliner, throughout ProjeKct Two - Live Groove.But it's ProjeKct Three - Masque and ProjeKct Four - West Coast Live that delivers the most explosiveness. Fripp stretches out sonically through wickedly harsh, metallic-like performances, which covers the artistic canvas with power and urgency.Each CD is a gem and travels a vast landscape of creativity, sound and vision."
1,Buyer Beware,"Please be careful. Alzheimer Disease is a devistating disease and it is not fair to offer families false hope. There are so many things we have learned over the years to help make this disease easier to understand, however, to steer individuals this way is wrong."
1,Positively horrific,"Things I've learned from reading just the first chapter of this book at the Pearls' Web site -- if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself by searching for ""No Greater Joy"":* Place appealing objects within reach of toddlers, then ""switch"" (aka smack) their hands when they reach for them.* If your nursing baby bites your breast, pull his hair.* Newborns cry to be manipulative.* Training children is just like training animals. (I have to wonder, then, why the Pearls advocate hitting children, when the vast majority of dog trainers don't advocate hitting dogs. I've never once laid a hand on my dog all through her training, and she is perfectly well-behaved.)There may be a few positives about this book, but I would never in a million years support these authors by buying anything of theirs."
2,Piano Romantico,"Heard this music being played as background music in a Mexican restaurant. The waiter was kind enough to get me the title. I ordered it and it came with 2 disks. In my humble opinion, this is the best piano music available. This guy is fantastic. It is now standard dinner background music at our home."
2,THE most underappreciated band,"short shrift indeed. swirly, dreamy, literary, skying wah-wah guitary, blissy, lovely fuzzpop. Get thee to a record store-ery and get ejector seat reservation and 99th dream (you already have Raise, i imagine). if you like this you will want to seek out THE LUCY SHOW, THE BLACK WATCH, MEDICINE, AND THE SWIRLIES. ""Duel"" on this record is one of the most majestic, transcendental things i have ever heard. yr oddessy, morrissey, is just beginning! love 'em!!!!"
2,Superwinch wireless remote,"Although I have not used it yet, if it works as good as the other components I purchased for the S5000 winch it will be great. Glad I bought it.Very easy to hook up."
1,Less than perfect,"I purchased two Kindles, one for myself and one for my husband.And guess what? The coverage map (when I entered my zip code) indicated that there was wireless coverage where I live. It turns out that there is no coverage IN MY WHOLE STATE!!! Sprint coverage, at best, is extremely spotty except in high population areas.Major bummer.And, to add insult to injury, I can't download the free samples of books to my computer, only directly to the Kindle.Please Amazon/Kindle, fix these problems!"
1,What a let down,This isn't a guidebook at all! It's a brief overview of some landmarks in NY. If you've never been to NY and don't know the difference between Brooklyn and Manhattan then this will clear things up. But if you are looking for something to help plan a vacation this is not it.
1,Disappointment,"What a disappointment. We ordered the Traveldock 900 for Christmas for our son's Creative Zen M mp3 player. There are not a lot of these devices on the market for Creative so we were happy to see this one. Unfortunately, when you put the MP3 player on the base it is unstable and actually partially blocks one of the speakers. The sound definitely does not ""fill a room."" Kudo's to Amazon for promptly refunding our money."
2,Nice Book,Nice book. Easy to read and understand. Gave an insight to WWII Pilot life and also into the charateristics of the aircraft/s.
2,Great gift for your children,"This rotating calendar is a stylish way to remember birthdays and anniversaries of loved ones. I wish my parents had given this to me years ago, before I made the fatal mistake of missing my mom's birthday. I'm still working my way out of the dog house with the help of this calendar. The still life prints are beautiful too."
2,Step Up From PHM.,"After their debut was released in '89, they made a comeback in the early '90s. It's an EP with 6 full length tracks and 2 instrumentals. The songs are a lot better than any off Pretty Hate Machine and it's when they turn from '80s electronic/techno to industrial and hard rock. It's not real mature lyrically or musically but it's a step and it's a sign of things to come. The songs are way heavier than on their debut and Broken still is their only truly metal album to date. Wish, Physical and Gave Up are my favorites and stand out the most. Rest of the CD is also very enjoyable though. Broken is only the beginning and The Downward Spiral comes 2 years later."
2,"David Sanborn's best, by far (one humble opinion)","This collection really moves-it has the most energy and enthusiasum that I've heard in a David Sanborn album. None of his other works have come close to this one, and every track is good."
1,Ride is too short for use in Cycling,"I enjoyed the other Bike-O-Vision projects very much but this presentation is so short, under twenty minutes. It was not very appropriate for indoor cycling training."
2,Great Knife!,"Not flimsy, but a little bit noisy. Similar to my last Black and Decker electric knife that lasted about 20 years until a piece of plastic broke off the knife! The handle still works and the new blade fits in it (just in case!) Good product; good company."
2,This is a good product!,"When my Mac Powerbook G4's cord started going on the fritz a year and a half after I had gotten my laptop, I wasn't sure what to do. Since the Macbook has replaced the Powerbook, Apple no longer sells the adapter. And to get the adapter online was really expensive. When I found this option, I was thrilled. It has worked perfectly since the day I got it. It is sturdier than the Apple adapter, and so I feel it will last longer. Also, it is white, like many of the Apple adapters, so if you're worried about the aesthetics of your computer, this option is a good one. I highly recommend this product!Macally PS-AC4 AC Power Adapter for Apple G4"
1,Not Satisfied,I ORDERED NAVY SOCKS AND GOT WHITE SOCKS... MY HUSBAND NEEDED THESE SOCKS FOR HIS FOOTBALL GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HE RECIEVED. THANKS
1,They should be ashamed,"This product sucks. On my Windows XP machine I can only run this program with my firewall disabled, no other programs running, and the CD in the drive. And no wonder: I bought it from Amazon in 7/06 and it hasn't been updated since 2002. It's ancient & antiquated.Aside from the technical problems, it's just a shoddy game. The visuals are blurry, if the ""referee"" disallows a play where you've formed more than one word, it doesn't tell you which word is not allowed, it's slow, it's ""hint"" facility is ridiculous, and it uses multiple screens to accomplish simple set up tasks.Whoever owns the ""Scrabble"" name should be ashamed to have it on this game. It's particularly sad because a few years ago there was at least one excellent crossword game (Crosswise) that the company that owns Scrabble (Hasbro at the time, I think) ran out of business by threatening to sue them. Too bad they didn't buy out Crosswise and use it as the basis for electronic Scrabble.What a waste!"
2,Loved it!,"Great story. I watch it over and over to practice my Portuguese but it's such a good story, it's a joy every time."
2,Interesting,Very interesting book about trauma. It forces you to look outside the box on our response to trauma. It explains why we react the way we do.I haven't finished reading it yet to be able to tell you if it helped.
2,First Impressions are always best,"Good read. Loved the story line, lots of adventure and romance. I would definately read this book again. Kept me reading for hours. Well worth a read..."
1,Dissatisfied,"I'm dissatisfied with this bench. It's way too tall, even on the lowest setting, and I'm only 5'3"". The pad also came with spots on the seat. It appeared to be used. The box it came in was all taped up and looked re-used. As long as the goods inside were undamaged and in new condition, it wouldn't have bothered me. But again, the pad had spots on it, and there was no manual or anything that came with it, which I find odd. Even your simple toaster comes with directions or warranty of some sort. If I had purchased this at a local store, it would definitely be returned. Unfortunately, I don't want to have to pay for shipping to get a new one when the bench itself was about $30. I'm going to have to think about this one..."
2,All-Time FAVORITE,"I am an avid reader and this is the #1 favorite of mine. Anytime a girlfriend asks for a book recommendation, I always recommend this one - and they always LOVE it. You will love the characters.. a truly touching book! Read it!"
2,Good Stuff!,It always strikes me as funny when so called fans of a certain artist complain when they do not sound a certain way... Personally these people are not fans and never were. All those people care about is a particular sound and if they do not get it they start to moan and complain. Guess what folks? The point of being a musician is to grow and expand.... To me it is readily apparant to point out those that were able to change and remain fresh enough to remain and those that were not able to change and fade into the background and be forgotten after 5 years.... Don't believe me? Take a look through your music collection and think about who is and who is not around any more....Ok Ok...musicians that died get a pass...I am talking about those that were pretty much one hit wonders and flashes in the pan....You know who I am talking about....
1,Caution,"I bought this tape because the search engine brought it up when I asked for ""Song Of The South"". It is just a tape of sing-a-long children songs which includes Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Song Of The South. A good tape if that is what you really wanted."
2,A Pioneer In THe Field Of Solar Energy,"""A Pioneer In The Field Of Solar Energy""... ""She documents the development of the solar oven and includes plans for ...your own"",many recipes and alot of fun."
2,Good Listening,"This is a great CD for almost any age, as the name denotes. Great combination of upbeat and easy listening. Bought this as a gift for my 43 year-old, young-at-heart sister, and she loves is."
2,JAZZ not for the WEAK of Heart,"Joni has produced what I would consider a truly FINE jazz album. If you are looking for typical JM, then pass on this one. But if you want some smooth, satisfying, slinky, sounds--order it now."
1,"Bad acting & dialogue, below average looking actors!","This movie makes anyone NOT WANT to be gay. I have seen a lot of very artsy, well made gay cinema.... Inserting full on sex scenes in the middle and at the end of the movie only cheapened the movie--cuz the actors are below average looking from head to toe... The acting is so helpless. So, if you're into bad cinematography, sound, music, dubbing, and so forth, this movie's for you. But spare yourself of the agony that I went through!"
1,Poor!,"This CD is not meant for the American market. This is why Ministry have crammed so many commercial tunes onto this compilation. Ministry are trying to cash in on the huge UK dance music market by using tracks that are well known and have been largely commercialised in charts. The hip-hop that has been mentioned may seem strange to many people. This is because it is not hip-hop; it is UK garage, recently enjoying a boom in the UK music market. All that aside this is still a very poor compilation. The quality of Ministry CDs has gone down hill over the last year or two due to over commercialism of dance music in the UK and Europe."
1,Bad luck with reliability,The VCR on mine broke after I used it once (it now chews up tapes). I was past the meager warranty period and it would cost almost more than I paid for the thing to have it repaired. So I'm not a fan.
1,Interest Quotient doesn't make up for Flaws,"Manchester is a good writer. I'll grudgingly give him that. However, I wonder exactly what his purpose was in writing the volume? He must have known it would take a beating for its inaccuracies, so he didn't write it for the academics or scholars. I can only conclude that he wrote it as popular history, that is, to entertain the general public. Just the same, though a more casual approach with more entertaining material is justified for a general readership, still these people deserve a book that at least attempts to be truthful. Did he have an agenda? I don't know but it seems so. He skims over some individuals and periods while devoting multiple pages to others. I can't tolerate historians who cover fascinating times so dully that even fellow history buffs can hardly stifle the snores. However, I am picky enough to want reasonable accuracy too. Manchester could have done better."
2,Good quality solid bench,"This is a good quality bench. The parts are heavy duty and the mechanism for raising and lowering the bench is solid. Overall, it is very attractive and and pad seems to be well built.Construction was easy with just a couple of wrenches. I was missing a couple of small parts but the manufacturer sent me some new ones without any problems in a couple of days.My only complaint is that the cylindrical leg pads are mounted so close to the bench that it can be awkward to get your feet/legs behind them to do incline crunches. Otherwise I'm very happy with it and consider it good value for money, especially with the free shipping."
2,Great,Great book for anyone who truly wants to learn how to listen to someone.Listening is really important to any relationship
1,A Piece of @#$&*,"That's what this so-called power strip is. Like others have mentioned, I could not fit ONE plug of any of my electronic equipment into the outlets. Not one! To those who gave this product anything other than a 1 star you must not have purchased the same product because unless you want to damage the plugs on your good audio/video equipment this strip is a piece of expletive-deleted!!I was initially attracted by the brightly color-coded outlets which match my living room decor but after trying it out and finding not one well-fitted outlet, I consider myself out of $13.00 cuz you can't repackage this piece of expletive-deleted and send it back.I got a better deal from a 99cent store. Monster ought to be ashamed of themselves for selling such a piece of expletive-deleted.!!!"
2,A Strange Movie,"""Lars and the Real Girl"" was an offbeat, but enjoyable film. Ryan Gosling gives a very strong performance as a neurotic, delusional nerd who falls in love with a life sized love doll. In this film, he is nothing like the romantic leading man of his recent films."
2,Blew my mind.,"I relived the same moments JFK had.And Oliver Stone saying that ""JFK was never meant to leave Dallas alive.""Not just chilling, but so bone-chilling that it took me a long time to sleep.For sheer effect, it is on same par as ConspiracyConspiracymovie.The way each fact is researched thoroughly, the rattling inside the team of DA, and Jim's reaction to Robert Kennedy's assasination, my God."
1,very disappointed,"The charm itself was acceptable, however, due to the lack of care involved when packaging this item, the chain arrived to me knots and broken beyond repair. The chain arrives coiled up in a little pouch. For such a fragile chain, this is definitely a necklace that needs to be secured in a box, not coiled up in a small pouch where it will likely get in knots. The chain was broken and useless, i had to return it, and just purchase a new chain locally, as this was suppose to be a Christmas gift."
2,Excellent grounding in knowledge management theory and practice!,"Melissie is a wonderful person, a great writer, and a very knowledgeable knowledge management expert.Her writing is engaging without being patronizing or overly complex. She provides a wonderful overview of a number of different knowledge management practices. This was one of my most-thumbed-through books when I was first learning about knowledge management (having been asked to lead a brand-new knowledge management department, I had to come up to speed fast!).I highly recommend this book for anyone who's getting started in the field and wants to learn more, as well as anyone in any field who wants an overview of what knowledge management is all about."
1,wrng productI,"I like Twin lab products, because they are in glass bottles and a high quality supplement. I was sent tne multiple vitamins with iron when I Iordered WITHOUT iron. IThere used tobe a choice to contact sellar but no longer an option. I should get a replacement of correct product."

1,Breaks Super Easily!,"This collar is great in theory. But, considering it is meant to train dogs, it should be stronger in order to handle dogs that might pull, etc."
1,Espoma - shame on you!,"Espoma - how dare you market urea under the label ""organic traditions""! Urea is manufactured by combining natural gas with atmospheric nitrogen to create anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is then combined with carbon dioxide to form urea. All this is done in a manufacturing facility. This is NOT an organic product! Gardeners, look for the OMRI seal when you wish to purchase an organic form of nitrogen."
2,Bible Commentary,A great book to help understand the writers of the old testament and what the thinking was of the writers at the time it was written.
2,Our gruesome past,"An interesting book on the spectacle of violence. Written more like a casual read than an educational text, it is nonetheless factual and makes pertinent points about moral panic and the way in which we as a species engage with violent entertainment."
2,REQUIRED for the remixes at end of tiger and duke,"This CD is bazare. like everyone says. VERY bazare. BUT a lot of the funky noises and remixes in the tiger and the duke are featured in this album. If you need a song to look for to get into this album look to This Heat. That song takes so many different directions in its 10 mins, that I deem it one of my favorite TSOAF songs. plus its got keith singing (good old war), who is the man."
2,Best Car Seat Buy for Your Money,"You cannot go wrong with a Britax Marathon unless it doesn't fit in your car for some reason. My daughter still happily sits in her Marathon at 5 and a half, and still fits in it beautifully. The people who complain about the buckles being close to the baby, well, if the buckles aren't fitting close to their body, you need to have a certified child passenger safety technician look at how you're buckling your child to figure out what you're doing wrong. Parenting experience or experience selling car seats at BRU does not a car seat expert make. Please, parents, talk only to CPSTs about your car seat concerns. They are the only ones who are trained to give you the proper advice. As for older kids being mad about sitting in a ""baby"" car seat, who is the parent? My daughter sits in hers, and doesn't know any other option, because I tell her it's the safest place for her. End of story.- CPST and happy Marathon owner"
1,wouldn't dare to call my own,"First off, I don't understand why Marian would have to ugly down. Her ""Amanda ALWAYS WINS"" attitude made me want to scream. All she had to do was let her personality outshine Amanda's and stand up for herself. Then she'd never want for a friend or suitor. The man was pretty thick and not the least bit attractive. Basically you got a whole lot of boring people feeling sorry for themselves, then you get a lot of this boring stuff repeating itself, and then something somewhat exciting tries to happen but it only makes it feel random and downright unnecessary. The hero and the heroine (if you want to call them that) went from hating each other to making out, to bickering to rolling around in a barn, to ignoring each other to sucking each other's faces, to fighting to getting engaged. It became too much to keep up with. Is this the same Johanna Lindsey who wrote about that loving scoundrel, Jeremy Malory?!?"
2,Addicting and Fun.,"My Grandmother bought my daughter this dvd on her 3rd birthday and I can't get her to turn it off. SHE LOVES IT and would probably watch 24/7 if I would let her. My one year old boy likes to watch and dance along with it, too. It has a cute story line and fun songs. A must have for any child who loves to sing and dance."
1,i should have read the reviews first,"this machine offers nothing that a little elbow grease wouldn't accomplish. sprays out some solution and scrubs it in. the suction was so weak it left our carpets soaking wet. if i wanted that, i wouldn't have bothered buying a machine. will look into inexpensive wet-vacs instead. too bad."
1,Even more disappointing...,"Volume one of Betty Johnson's Hits was a considerable disappointment on many fronts. One would have hoped that some of the shortcomings of that piece would have been corrected here in the subsequent ""hits"" package. No such luck. And to label this a ""hits"" package is just plain misleading. No additional hits here at all with the exception of the inclusion of ""Dream"", a track that was listed but not included on the volume one CD.Again, sound quality is mediocre and obviously not taken from high-generation tapes. Unfortunately, for those seeking the music of this artist, there are no other options currently available. Johnson's contribution was a notable element of the music of the 50's and deserves much better treatment than that given here."
2,DEATH IS PAINLESS BY ARON LOUIS ROSA,"ROSA HAS WRITTEN A SPELLBINDING NOVEL.DEATH IS PAINLESS IS A GREAT STORY OF POLITICAL INTRIGUE, MILITARY MISS DIRECTION AND RAW COURAGE.HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SAID I WISH THE AUTHOR WOULD JUST STICK TO THE STORY INSTEAD OF ADDING FOUR HUNDRED PAGES OF FILLER JUST TO MAKE A THICKER BOOK.ROSA TELLS HIS STORY RELENTLESSLY AND WILL GLUE YOU TO HIS BOOK TILL THE END.CHARLES RABUN"
1,This is terrible!,I have now for years hamsters and I personally find this cage terrible. It is in my opinion way to small and all plastic. Hamsters have good teeth and can get hurt badly if they bite the plastic and swallow tiny pieces. The wheel ist way to small as well. My cage is a wire with a plastic tray. It is 100 cm long and 55 cm wide and 45 high. It came with a stand on wheels.I also put wooden houses and ramps and a wheel in. It is well ventilated and my hamsters really like it. In those closed tubes feces and mildew can grow and affect the hamsters health badly.Just think about it when you get a cage........Would you like to be trapped in those tubes?
1,Ok for beginners,"This book is a bit older but most fundamentals still apply. As a league bowler I know there is alot of important info here but with all of the other tools available, this is not the best option."
2,Real Life - Real People,"The best thing about this movie is that it ""feels"" real - Like it did or could reall happen to me or you. The fact that the caracters are lesbian is secondary to the story and the great acting performances. The actors are top rate, the setting was classic and interesting without being distracting. The movie is funny and entertaining while trying to get a serious message across without hitting you over the head. Yes that message is ""you can love"" even if you have AIDS and others can love you back."
2,"gotta have a little faith, eh?","This is a greatest hits collection, spread over two CDs, including hits from GM's Wham! days. It's great for listening when reading, or reflecting back on the days when we all had mousse or gel in our spiky hair. Careless Whisper is an old friend, as is Freedom 90, but a couple of songs are missing here (Somebody to Love, with Queen, and my guilty fave, I Want Your Sex). An enjoyable collection nonetheless."
1,What is going on?,"Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album. Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good. In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album. Now to this album, ""the new one"". You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album. What the hell was going on? Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song? Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it. Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!! Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD."
1,Amazon is the WORST video service!!!,"I am currently an Amazon Prime customer! I am also subscribed to two other video services (Netflix and Hulu), and I find that on their best day Amazon falls far short in ALL categories. Since movies consist of images and sound, Amazon fails on both counts. I have actually tested the Amazon sound with an identical movie on Netflix, and can understand every word on the Netflix version with the volume set at less than half of what I tried to hear the dialogue with on the Amazon version. THIS movie will takes forever to load, even when NOT HD. I have never had a single problem loading High Definition movies with any other online service, but again Amazon seems to have a problem getting video to my home screen more often than not. Amazon is the absolute WORST online video service I have experienced so far, and you can be sure they won't ""burn"" me in any more purchases from them!!"
1,I would like to return Season 1 to WB,"I am so disappointed in WB. They have release so many stupid shows and this was one of the top shows ever. What are they thinking??? I would like to return my season 1 to them for a refund. After all, who wants an incomplete set? I did email asking where I can return season 1 but they ignored my email. I too am not going to be buying anymore sets. What a rip-off!!"
1,Boring,"Lots of scenes from Iran which for someone who travels there from time to time is not anything special. Kind of depressing melancholic mood, tone, sound, color. Depressing movie. Waste of time if you ask me - I wouldn't recommend it. Sorry."
1,The Best of Abbott & Costello,3 out of 4 videos worked great but the other video would not start. I contacted the seller with 2 emails but got no response. I would be wary on buying any more videos from Amazon
2,To Whom It May Concern,Great music and talent. Lisa Marie has really matured. Can't wait until the next CD.
1,DRM Failure,"Thank God for Piracy. Why? Because without the pirates, I could never play this game, in spite of owning it. I have the CD, I have the game manual, I have the box, yet I cannot play the game. Stupid Securom and the DRM has locked me out. I bought the game, and I have the right to play it - that is all I want to do, yet I cannot. I have to go to crack sites and download questionable files, just so that I may legitimately play the game. This is a fun game, but don't buy it. Wait 'till they have no choice but to give it away. Its a real shame that EA (and other publishers) are completely alienating their legitimate customers. What if you get tired of the game and want to sell it? That is completely within your rights, but the DRM takes that ability away. So sad that you won't be able to find this one on a used game shelf. Some lawyers need to get together and perform a class-action lawsuit against EA! Disgusting!"
2,Does work in short ranges,Seems to work but in short distances. My pet does get a shock and never go back to the same spot again.
1,"doesn't stay in place, save your $$ and don't buy it","The concept of this product is supposed to be good. But in real use, the first test failed. The Garmin portable friction mount does not stay in place. When the car moves, it moves and shifts and also falls over. Please keep your money in your pocket and don't buy this product!"
2,Great Digital SLR,"The Nikon D50 is everything it's touted to be. The picture quality is great and it is the perfect mix of easy to use, while maintaining manual/professional controls. The color balance and contrast only occasionally need adjusting. I have been particularly impressed with the nighttime portrait mode, which leaves a lot of the original ambiance of the picture and doesn't overwhelm your subject with a too bright flash. The lens that is included leaves something to be desired, however, and will likely need to be replaced with a faster one fairly soon. Overall, I am very please with this camera and the pictures it has produced thus far."
2,Inspiring,"I am a Macho Man amongst Macho Men and I'm not ashamed to say that this movie makes me cry. For anyone in need of inspiration in a tough moment, anyone who wants some thing so bad you are willing to sacrafice any and everything, you need to watch this movie. I am in the middle of a hectic time filled with challenges and I'm buying this movie to help get me over the hump..."
2,classic sci-fi with humor,"Just like a comic book....with awesome special effects. It is in my ""favorites"" box of DVD's with Evil Dead and Princess Bride.I tell everyone about it..Very, very cool. I HIGHLY recommend it !"
1,Verithin are STUDENT GRADE Prismacolors -> cheaper price = lower quality,"Verithin prismacolors are not ""real"" Prismacolor, of which I was unaware. They do not mark with the same vivid color and soft pigment trademark of ""normal"" prismacolor. Buyer BEWARE. You are NOT buying real prismacolors. These mark with the same intensity as Roseart colored pencils. They do NOT blend well. In fact, they don't even match color with ""real"" prismacolor. When you buy Verithin you're getting what you pay for: cheaper quality for a cheaper price. Do not fall for the same ruse that I did. Go the extra $10 and buy the real thing."
2,Sure To Beat Jedi Outcast,"This game looks really cool. Knights of the Old Republic takes place 4,000 years before the first Star Wars film, in the middle of a war between the Jedi and the Sith. You have a fully customizable character, and you always have an older sibling of the opposite gender who is a skilled Jedi Knight. Eventually you will become one, too. But before that, it's you and whatever blasters you may find or pick up. Also, you can make a group that can consist of Wookiees, Jedi, droids, Twi'Leks, or whatever is present and strikes your fancy. You'll travel to many worlds in your ship, the Ebon Hawk, very similar to the Millenium Falcon. En route, however you'll face Sith fighters. This game looks very exciting."
1,Really good at ruining the can your trying to open.,Every can i try to open. It will open 1/2 and 1/2. Leaving at 12 and 6oclock just enough can to where you cant get anything out. Wont buy kitchen aid again. It just keeps popping off the cans. I checked rolling them on the counter and the cans are still round. Not oval.
2,Silver Egg Personal Body Massager,So far it has better quality than Adam & Eve products. My wife is very happy with it.Silver Egg Personal Body Massager
2,Fantastic Read,"This book is marvelous, a true insight to the times and the life of a true saint. One should have no doubts about authenticity, nor doubt the author's talent when purchasing this book. It is utterly fantastic."
1,Buy the UK version,"I bought this at my local record store and was pretty excited to see how it sounded...turns out they did a pretty bad job. The vinyl is noisy and has lots of random pops here and there. Unacceptable for new vinyl. I saw another review saying that the UK version is actually produced properly and sounds as good as the original. Out of curiosity, I decided to buy it and see how it sounded, and yes, it sounds excellent and the vinyl is not noisy like the American version. So, I advise you to go on amazon.co.uk and buy it there and wait it out on the shipping. You won't be disappointed. Also, the UK version has a paper sleeve with a plastic liner. American version only has paper."
2,Get this Game!,"This is a must have for roller coaster tycoon fans. The new rides are awesome and the new scenery keeps you busy for hours and hours. Some new rides include, The Circus Show, Wooden Side Friction Roller Coaster, Vertical Air Coaster, Enterprise, Virginia Reel, Crooked House, and thats just the beginning. I haven't even seen a fraction of them yet. Also there are new shops and stalls. Some new shops/stalls: HotDog Stand, Coffee Cafe, T-SHirt stand, and more. Also, EVERY ride can play music which makes it more like a real amusement park. There are also new landscaping options, new view options, new footpath options, new ride design options, banners which you type the text for, new entertainers, and over 60 new scenerios!!!!!!! WELL WORTH IT!"
1,Wishing it would work in my DVD player!!,"Thus Dvd was a present for my mother, it just won't work in any Dvd player we have, I sent the original back and Amazon graciously gave me another one, itjust will not work!! Amazon even gave me back my money. I don't know if this particular type of Dvd just won't play in any of my players or my neighbors or my mom's.I am bummed out because my mother loves Rod Stewart and at this point just don't know what to do!!"
1,0 star for the video direction,"Terribly thing to do to an opera ....The video direction ,make this dissaster ...."
2,A pretty cool idea and it's also Live Ted,"All-in-all just a fun record. The songs are original and there are some killer songs, some funny (what the heck was he thinking), and some duds. It's live and that's always a bonus for Ted fans."
1,Terrible quality.,I bought this from Sabrina Silver. It was terrible quality. Looked like it had been cut out with a band saw. And they sent me a size that wouldn't fit. I tried all my fingers to no avail. I won't be buying from these folks again.
1,.................,"usually jerry's scores for movies are priceless,(i.e. the other score for ""legend"")but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too""forced"" for my taste.it's ok as a weird sort of comedy album,I suppose,but from the main theme I was laughing because it's meant to be such a serious experience-but isn't!I think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd.(.)"
1,Didn't work for us,"Child tips forward (face first) in the water. Tried it with lots of kids who've come around -all 2-3 yes old. Might be better for older kids. We use the puddle jumper instead, love it."
1,MAKE SURE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I have received several orders of the 2x180 Duralactin tablets. They are shipped quickly by the reseller and packaged well enough, but each of the last few bottles has had several broken or crushed tablets. The previous shipment had more than six smashed pills, and the bottle I checked at random in my most recent order had only 177 pills out of 180. That may sound like I got 98 percent of my order, but to me it sounds like I got my Big Mac with a bite taken out of it. It's a day's worth of pills for my dog. The vendor needs to consider if he should send out a free bottle of 60 tablets for every ten of the 180's a customer orders ! And Duralactin needs to figure how to deliver 180 pills, when that's what they say they're selling !!"
1,Started Strong and Then It Just Died in It's Tracks,"I'm two thirds through this book and I don't know if I have the desire to finish. The book started strong and for a few hundred pages I was enthralled. There were a few oddities like the strange narrative device used at the beginning and then dropped. But the sweeping detail and interesting characters kept me avidly turning the pages.But now, about 2/3 done or more, the book has simply lost it's way. A major character was killed off for no apparent reason (in a book that features a smallish cast of characters). The plot has taken a totally unbelievable turn and the narrative seems to juts be sitting there with nothing to say.Very disappointing to say the least. Don't know if I can summon up the desire to finish, especially since so many readers feel cheated by the ending. The author of this book got the build-up right but he just can't seem to follow through on any of the interesting early material."
2,Great Book,This is a great book for people with health concerns. No matter what your issue having a healthy gut will help your overall wellness. It's easy to read and to understand.This book helped me to trace the origins of my health problems and it got me wondering just which malady started first.
2,Excellent DVD player that plays all your CDRs: ),"The main reason I bought this DVD player is that it can play CDR disc as well. It surely is fun to load in your own CDR disc loaded with MP3s or VCD movie. The picture and sound quality is very good, better than the Panasonic AU120 model I had before."
1,Meh,"These are just so-so. I bought these for my daughter over the summer and they are already drying out and not really that colorful on the paper anymore, even though I'm adamant about putting the caps on tightly after use. I would stick with the old school thick Crayola markers, as those seem to last longer."
2,Amazing for all Fans.,"First of all i am a big fan of Michael Jackson. I own all the DVD collections and audio collections ever done my Michael. I was really amazed upon receiving this new special edition CD.It also comes with a DVD, but has only a few videos in it, It would have been nice if they have included the complete video set from the thriller album including the making of Thriller videos.The CD quality is amazing, plays perfect with crystal clear sound on my BOSE Car Stereo."
2,Love your Chow!,"This inexpensive book is one of the best Chow books available. Written by a well-respected breeder/judge of Chows. Covers all aspects of care and training. This is the best selling Chow book at the Dog Shows. Don't be misled by the small size, the true description of the Chow's unusual character is there."
1,Unsafe handle,This pot arrived badly packed and rattling around in the box. Opened it to find that the handle had snapped off during shipment. When I looked at the point where the handle had been attached there was just the smallest dot of what was a welded joint still visible. I probably just got a bad one but for a pot that has some heft to it (and could be full of hot coffee) it doesn't seem like a safe design to begin with. I'm glad it broke in the box and not in use. Whatever site sold it to me through Amazon gave me an instant refund :-).
1,Not even close to the wire,"After paying good money for a new copy of this book, I felt downright gypped. Page after page is filled with stodgy writing and tedious information that reads like a compilation of disconnected facts, records and quotes rather than a continuous story. The many obvious factual mistakes that litter the pages also add to the feeling that this is the product of a writer whose main concern was quantity rather than quality; the product of a writer who was counting on the subject matter rather than the writing to be the main draw. Not recommended."
2,Great paper.,"Although this is Origami paper, I bought it because the squares are exactly the right size for something I wished to wrap (well, many somethings). It worked great for what I wanted, especially because I could use the many different colors.However, now that I am done with project, I think I will learn how to do Origami. The paper is a nice weight and is easy to fold. And having a choice of ten different colors is great, too.If I don't do too well learning Origami, I know I can think of ways to use the great colors in collage designs for the cards I make.Submitted: hlinnstoryteller"
1,uuhh a 12 year old can do better,"i wish i had sampled it before i got it. its childlike. it has unneccessary laser blasts and blips that make mecco seem like a beethoven symphony. you want star wars dance stick to dezrok that has all the passion,intensity this cd wishs it had!"
2,Very nice set especially for the money,Bought this to replace a very expensive crystal set I'd given away and like it a lot for the money. It's pretty and functional. Comes nicely packaged too. Would not hesitate to give as a gift.
1,not good with my rifle,"Ammunition is different in each rifle and with this ammo in my winchester model 1000 groups were very inconsistent. the closest spread I got was 4.5 to 5 inches at 25 yards. when I started using the old ammo that I was running out of, my groups were in .25 to .5 inch spreads. So for my rifle these pellets did not work."
1,Very unremarkable,I think Galaxie 500 -- at least on this CD -- think they're Yo La Tengo. Except Yo La Tengo are good and Galaxie 500 are mediocre.
1,Ok in the beginning....but after a year it jams on photo paper,"I have to say I had been pretty happy with this printer. I used it for the past two years pretty heavy while working on my Master's Degree, however, now it continues to jam with any type of cardstock or photo paper. Just a warning to anyone who may wish to print with heavier paper types...don't buy this printer."
2,Every song on this CD is just great!!!,"This was Cheo's 1979 release (which he co-produced with Papo Lucca). Cheo gives some emotive and evocative readings on the boleros (""Lucero"", ""Cualquier Cosa"", ""Con Mis Memorias"") and turns the heat up on the dance numbers (""Los Entierros, ""Estampa Marina"", ""Desahogo"",""Asi Soy"").This album is just great any way you look at it."
2,Computer Caper Chaos,"P. M. Terrell, author of the wildly successful KICKBACK, is back with another hair-raising, fast-paced thriller pitting a savvy programmer, a tv news reporter out of his depths, & an enigmatic Chinese-American translator against a dogged police inspector, a newly elected politician & the shadow men of the CIA & FBI.From a news conference with a governor-elect who has a strange reaction to the phrase ""starving children in China,"" to a ski resort in a blizzard where snow plows unearth a corpse, to an inner chamber where computer printouts of a super-secret program must be decoded, to an inauguration on the steps of a state's Capitol, to clandestine meetings and security lockdowns, THE CHINA CONSPIRACY winds the excitement tight, as Kit Olsen & her amateur team pursue the conspirators who have put the results of a recent election in doubt."
2,Steiger Unforgetable !!,"Rod Steiger delivers a superb performance as Sol Nazerman who is haunted by events of the past and disturbed by the reality of the present. Brock Peters , Juano Hernandez and Geraldine Fitzgerald are in top form. but it is Steiger who brings us to the brink..especially ... in the final sequence which packs a wallop you will not soon forget."
1,Please do not make the same mistake I made,I have Civ 5 on a windows machine. I thought Civ IV (on the Mac) would be similar and I thought $15 would be worth it. It is not! The game looks primitive in comparison! I wish I had not wasted my money by buying this outdated game.
2,I want this doll !!!,I am 12 years old and it kinda seems wierd but I want a Baby Born Doll. From the bad reviews I think they are wrong!! My best friend has one and she says the are sooooo cute and when I had a baby born when I was 7 it did NOT pee everywhere..If you are my age or older and you like baby dolls you should get this one!!!
1,Not singing in the rain,"I ordered a DVD based on the five star reviews, when I received the DVD it is not legal for use in the USA. Sold by: ZOverstocksUSA."
2,Good Mp3 Player,"I also experienced the problem that two other reveiwers of this product did. Namely, my screen would flash on and off. I tried replacing the batteries and that didn't work. Finally in desperation I turned the device on and pressed the menu button several times in a row. This fixed the problem and I haven't experienced it since! The sound quality on this prodcut is good. With the volume being (for me anyway) more than loud enough. The radio and voice recording are both decent. Overall this was a very good buy for the money."
1,Vampire Flick,Lame vampire flick about a woman who has recurring dreams of her lover 100 years ago. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,He almost fooled me,The book started off good for the first 150 pages and just went downhill. This book should be called Rap for Dummies. The author of this book needs to stick to magazines.
1,"Tennis Skills,The player's guide",Waste of money. I found nothing new in the book to improve the tennis game.Though it has a colorful sequence of amateur players and sprinkle of one shot of some professional players. The book could have been organizedwith detail suggestions. But I guess coaches do not divulge their secretsin the paper back book.
2,Gene Pitney Greatest Hits,Great songs from the past. Good sound quality. Will enjoy playing this CD over and over. One of our favorite singers from the 60's.
1,Another cheap Universal defective.,"My copy skips and freezes. I wish Universal would take care in their products. I've had defective Munsters season 2, Dragnet ( 2 copies) ,and now this one . The shows are great, but it's frustrating to get into an episode and then have it freeze so you can't see the ending. I'd rather pay more and have better quality."
1,A disgrace,"It's a pack of lies and has been exposed as such in some detail by the likes of Finklestein. Amazed that (i) it's still published. and (ii) quoted by parts of the Israel Lobby that will do and say whatever they can to deny the wrongs committed against the indigenous population. You should hang your heads in shame.Given that Finklestein and others have openly accused Peters of being the worst sort of fraud and liar, do you ever wonder why she has never provided a cogent reply to their very serious charges?"
2,Great Stories,"The premise of the book is clearly defined in the title -- it doesn't make a claim to be scientific discovery, rather the book consists of compelling and overwhelming anecdotal evidence to support its assertions. Anyone who has positive, lasting relationships with animals will find these stories fascinating and often moving. If you're looking for science-method accounts of animal behavior, likely as not the word ""Beauty"" will not figure in the title. Otherwise, I was most satisfied by this book."
2,Blah,"I read this book a while back, in 6th grade. As the teacher passed the books out to us I thought it was just going to be another one of those boring books that we have to read for school. When I opened that book and started reading I couldn't put it down. It was just so facinating. My teacher said there was so many symbolic things in the book relating to the authors Chrisianity. For the people who don't know what I'm talking about. The Lion, Aslan, is represented as God.I thought this book was really good. Better than good. It was just like one of those books that you wished you were in. Like 'Eden' as they would say."
2,Fabulous,Ms Evanovich has a grab your seat way of writing with suspense and laugh out loud tid bits . Fabulous
1,Good - But not great,"The basic premise of this film was, it seemed, to shock an revile, it should have but it failed. Unforetunately we live in the 90's real world, and while we may debate on whether snuff films actually exist, sickos portrayed do exist and heroes like Cages' character do not. The plot, story, cast and the acting were excellent, as was the potential of the execution, but the end product was a major let down. If you want realism look out for Tim Roth and Ray Winstone - Hollywood still has a lot to answer for."
2,Our world as it might have been ...,"In this nightmarish ""alternate history"" novel, the United States and the Allied Powers were soundly defeated in World War II, and America is now occupied by Nazi Germany east of the Mississippi, and Japan in the West. Erwin Rommel is Military Governor of Nazi Occupied America, in which the Nazi racial purity laws are in full and vigorous effect. In the west, Japan rules with a more humane, but still an iron hand, and in both areas Americans themselves are a downtrodden minority and underclass in their own country, and America is being colonized by the victors.But is this real? Or is this alternate universe a mistake; a kind of kink in time? The reader must judge. Author Dick specializes in stories that test the meaning and substantive nature of reality, and that is part of the theme of this compelling novel.This is one of the great ""alternate history"" novels of Science Fiction, and you do not want to pass it up."
2,A Kiss Remembered,"Throughout the novel, you are kept interested in what is going to happen next. The main characters Grant Chapman and Shelley are in love with each other. Shelly has been in love with Grant for years. For so many years, it has been Shelley loving Grant and not the other way around. Now, the tables have turned. Mr. Chapman is falling in love with Shelly, his current college student. Grant invited Shelley to go out with him to a popular place where many of his college students would be. It was then that she decided that she no longer wanted to be seen with him in public. Will she continue to fall in love or will she forget?"
2,A BRILIANT PIECE OF WORK,Even though i didnt enjoy being referred to as a white blue eyed devil every other paragraph. This book made me think and challenged me to treat my fellow man better. After reading about malcolms childhood and how he grew up i can now understand his bitterness and why he fought so hard for equality. I now see why time magazine voted it one of the best books of the century.
2,Works as advertised,"Quality product that does what it says it does. It's convenient that it doesn't require batteries, although it's not as bright as it would be otherwise. The battery required for the IR light isn't standard and was hard to find, but it worked fine without it.It's amazing to see how many stars you can't see with the naked eye."
2,windshield fixit,Item arrived in a timely manner. Instructions were clear and easy to understand. I had no problems repairing a chip in my windshield. From the outside of the vehicle the chip is barely visible. It is a little easier to spot from the inside. Don't know yet about how durable the repair will be but I am pleased with the results.
2,received quickly,"This game came very quickly and made it in time for Christmas. My son loves it. I am not a huge fan of video games and their content, but all that aside, it was a good purchase."
1,be careful,solid for the warratny period and then the hard drive wont kick in when you plug it in and want to get your data back. it hums but the usb is never recognized. i dont know if data is lost or just inaccesible.
1,Fairies... not what I had in mind..,"This book isn't at all what I had hoped it would be. The stories and descriptions are ok.. they seemed to concentrate more on norse myths... but the illustrations were so disappointing. I am a big Brian Froud fan... and after seeing his magnifican drawings, well.. these just don't even compare. So if you like diversity, this might be ok for you. But if you like the beautiful artwork... I'd pass on this one."
1,Book was written for Windows 95,"There are many complaints about this book, but what people need to realize is that this book was based on someone coding Java on a Windows 95 machine! Page 1.8 shows the program list, with some Win 95 programs. Now that most people are coding on Windows 7, how can this really be relevant? They need an updated version that fits with computers we use today. Page 5.22 shows ancient computers in a shopping cart. I know the basics haven't changed much, but come on: saving on a floppy disk?!"
2,"taut,, engaging thriller","Once again, Belsky shows his stuff in this well-written thriller, with well-drawn characters. Couldn't put it down."
2,seriously a great guide to vacationing,"if you had no idea what to do or what to expect when heading to the virgin islands for the first, then this is the read for you. the ideas in activity as well as the breath taking sites are completely cataloged in this book. incredibly necessary."
1,Another simple movie.,"Other than the special effects, this movie is kind of boring. The actors were not very convening. There is nothing new about industrial sabotage or even a dream with in a dream. The only complicated thing about the movie is keeping track of the layers of the dream. This is not that hard as each dream layer is very different from the one before.I see no reason why the movie is as popular as it is. Must be good advertising.The movie is okay but I'll not waste my time watching it again."
1,Buyer Beware,"Upon arrival item is lightweight. They claim that weight in description is a ""typo"" but is still not fixed (item weight is about 5#). Do not buy this item."
2,Great for what it is intended for!,"I haven't had an accounting course in 10 years, this book provides questions and problems as would be on the CLEP exam. It is a great application study guide but you will need a college text book. I used my old text book from 10 years ago to assist with my preparation. This book won't teach you accounting but it does help prepare you for the test."
2,Well Built and as Advertised,"Good capacitors rated 100V. These are non-polar, 1 uF capacitors for a tweeter crossover filter. They work well as advertised."
1,What happened to Lynn,"I remember reading Lynn's book ""Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting"" and it came at a turning point in my life and I inhaled it like a drowning man inhales air. Having said that I can only shake my head in sadness for whatever must have happened to Lynn before she passed on. She kept saying in ""Dear God! What's Happening to Us"", that it sounded crazy and thats the ONE statement in that whole sad book that I agree wholeheartedly with. I have no idea what happened to Lynn that took her off in what was obviously some sort of delusionment that flew in the face of all that she had written previously, but its very sad. If you have ever read any of her previous work, please spare yourself the time and money and leave this sad tome on the shelf and remember Lynn when she obviously had all her faculties and was lucid"
1,Ports failing after a few years,"We've had this for about 3 and a half years now and 5 of the ports have gone bad. Because of that, the switch itself is slow and intermittent. We'll be replacing it immediately, but not w/another D-Link product for sure."
1,piece of junk,"I bought this for my 5 year old for her birthday. The wings keep falling off and so does the necklace and bell on it. Also the saddle falls off when you put the barbie on. I have many mattell toys and this by far is the worst quality I have ever seen. I called the compony and they offered a refund but how do you return a birthday present. Even though I am displeased with the quality, my daughter won't part with it."
2,Excellent,"This is an excellent survey of the history and design of safety cards. I thought that the cards selected were an excellent choice and it would have been impossible for it to be comprehensive. Overall, an excellent book."
1,Just when you start to trust an author...,"It's funny how pro- Zion, modern Israeli supporters and apologists receive the most positive, complimenting, and politically correct reviews. Anytime someone writes a book or comments about the real facts about the Zionist-terrorist activities of the modern day, fraudulent Israel, there is a knee jerk reaction to attack and accuse that person of being ""anti- Semitic"", even though the Arabs that they terrorize are also Semitic people.There is no doubt that the holocaust happened, but way more Christians and other people were murdered than the exaggerated 6 million figure claimed by Zionists and real Jews. These positive reviews for an apparently pro- zion author helped me avoid wasting money on the book. And i thought Dave was a solid Christian..."
1,Cracked Crock Pot,"There is so much to love about the design/features of this crockpot that it's a shame the crock is no good. Kitchenaid provided me with a THIRD crock, which promptly cracked 15 minutes into my pork spareribs this morning. I began to think maybe it's only because I bought a refurbished unit until I read reviews here, Macy's, JC Penneys - and more - all saying the same. I can't believe they haven't solved the problem. It may well be that the element is just too hot, but then they should issue a recall for all. Don't be tempted...it's a bad product in it's current state. Too bad I sold my old little crock at a garage sale! 20 years and it never cracked!"
1,Fine while it's working,"I paid the full... for mine, but had to return it just 3 months laterwhen it stopped working. The very unfriendly people at Braun sent me anew one (eventually), but that only worked for another 9 months untilit too stopped. I enjoyed using it, but I won't bother getting anotherone until Braun get a quality control system in place."
2,Serve the purpose,These work just like they are supposed to. Was able to label cds and dvds. I like being able to choose which point to use.
1,CANN YOOU HEEARR ME???,"Unless you have a psu with dedicated ""FAN ONLY"" molex connections so as to control this fan's speed OR an external fan speed controller it will sound like an old Eureka vacum cleaner! Many online have posted this fan did not last that long...it runs @ very HIGH rpm w/o some type of speed control, which will reduce its lifespan. I have this fan mounted next to a HIS iSilence5 Radeon HD 6670 graphics card (EGGcellent deal on it) using a Zalman fan speed controller. On low speed setting it is quiet moving fair amount of air and my peak graphics card temp under a heavy 3-d graphical load has been 37C*Pros:1- Works great mounted next to a passively cooled HIS iSilence5 graphics card (fan is perfect lenght)Cons:1- W/O fan speed control it will be LOUD and burn out quick2- Like to see a 3 pin connector3- Should include mounting screwI gave it one star, since w/o speed control it is LOUD and I had to fabricate a 3 pin connection to use this fan with Zalman fan speed controller."
1,Informercial for Books,"You think this guy is out to disprove Super Size Me's but him and his ""experts"" were only out for a buck, which is admirable but says nothing about how to help the greater good. Or how to develop a government solution himself. I got sick of seeing the books his ""experts"" wrote. Unlike Super Size Me, he exercised, watched his calories, chose what we wanted to eat, and didn't drink full sugar soda. He didn't want to address the dangers of drinking diet soda, but I won't go there. He also doesn't get the fact that for some people, this is their only source of food due to the price. Living in a narrow-minded environment will narrow your views. And is there real scientific proof that ""Metabolic Syndrome"" exists? I didn't think so. This wasn't comedy = it's just another piece of propoganda. PS - how much of his hamburgers were really meat and how much of it were soy and other things he found bad?"
1,Bribes are Good,The data in this book provides a solid foundation for analysis. The problem is that author lands on some mis-guided conclusions. People at the end of the day are driven by self interest. Rewards play on that and as a result are generally effective. Kohn tends to dismiss this.
1,Doesn't stick,"20 06 11It's claimed that Just4Copper doesn't stick to your hands when you knead it. That's true. Unfortunately, it also doesn't adhere well to the copper pipe. I sanded and wire brushed the pipe, kneaded the stuff, and applied as instructed about a 1/4"" of the mix around the pinhole leak. (Water had been drained for a few days.) Turned the water on after a day, and there was water oozing out around the edges of the patch. Greenish-colored water, I should add. A bit concerned about that. Now I must figure out a way to get the stuff off the pipe.I rate it ""zero stars"". Unfortunately the Amazon rating system demands at least one star. So be it.John Lukens"
2,necklas,I was very happy with the item I wear it all the time and I get a lot of compliments great price great quality great item thanks
1,No torque,"I should have heeded the advise of your other reviewers. When they complained about the lack of torque, I thought how bad could it be. Well I found out. I tried to assemble a prefab simple bookcase, the screwdriver was useless. I would strongly recommend not to purchase this item."
1,Sets a record for how quickly I returned a product!,"I was in a jam. My work vacuum failed, and I needed something FAST. I snagged one of these and away I went. Within 24 hours, back I came!Pros:* Comes fully assembled* Nicely balanced* Folding handle - easy to store* Good suctionCons:* THE DIRT GOES RIGHT TO THE FILTER! (no, my caps lock is not stuck)* The dirt goes right to the filter!* Did I say the dirt goes right to the filter?* Short power cord.I was dumbfounded. In the filter chamber, dust and dirt filled the area around the filter, and the canister was nearly EMPTY. Hoover blew it first time out with bagless and their tall side-by-side filter/canister system, then blew it again with their Fusion series cone/cyclonic design (which I deal with daily) - and now they are at strike 3 with this design. I give up on Hoover. Recommend to a friend? I don't hate anyone that much!"
1,"Distorted noise, bad on the ears","One word: Junk'o'RamaTo elaborate on that, this CD is awfully distorted with a lot of treble. There doesn't seem to be much mid-range sound in it, it's all treble and few bass thuds which don't amount to much. Yuck!"
1,There are a few sweet gems on this one,"The songs I like the most on this cd are so melancholy. The title track, ""It's Madness"" and ""Life's Opera"" just really make me ponder and wish MG were still alive. They are so sad yet give us a glimpse into the man himself, his feeling, emotions, beliefs, hopes and dreams."
1,Another disappointment,I was told that this was the savior of the underground. Well I really should have just listened to Orchid instead.
2,Chaucer's Tales Brought to Life,"Writer and director Pasolini presents a selection of Chaucer's stories, most notably The Wife of Bath and The Miller's Tale. The Canterbury Tales is not without its weaknesses. The quality of the acting is variable (the dubbing doesn't help), and the editing is rough. Some stories end/start so abruptly that it takes you by surprise. However, I can forgive this film almost anything. For me, the atmosphere and feel it conveys far outweigh any faults it may have. Pasolini has recreated Chaucer's lusty medieval world with an earthy realism, exuberance, and zest for life in a way that few other directors could have managed. People who are easily shocked should beware. Pasolini has concentrated on the bawdier aspects of the tales, and added few of his own for good measure. It all combines to give The Canterbury Tales a wonderful hedonistic quality. The finale, a vivid depiction of Hell, makes for a superbly appropriate ending."
2,The best understanding/parenting difficult kids help book,"It's like the author has lived in our house with our child -- traditional behavior management doesn't work with our son, but the basket approach does. We're so much more relaxed and our son is learning how to adapt much more quickly than ever before."
1,Are you up for a fight?,"Can't get it to sink video. Spent hours downloadig this or that. I downloaded the converter software from sandisk's websight. But I still can't get it to do anything. I have spent 4 hours trying to make it work. Don't wast your time buy an iPod, it's only $50 bucks more but it will save hours and hours.... And hours. How much is a headach really worth?"
2,Short stories centering around living in Texas,"I don't live in Texas and I am always interested in different places-geography, food and culture.I like to know what life is really like in other places. Some of the stories are a bit too wordy for my taste but these points are often diminished by the interesting bits. Overall, I enjoyed this trip through Texas."
2,Bed for an old dog.,My older dog has arthritis and has trouble getting up on the bed where she has always slept. She will quietly sleep in this which is on my side of the bed for the better part of the night.With her pillow and blanket she remains peacefully at sleep without feeling abandoned.
2,Quantum Theory in Plain Language,"A book devoted to the development of quantum theory, Jim Baggott gives readers a much-desired rest from the mathematical rigidity of the subject. This book is fun, pleasant, and easy to read. It introduces the fundamental and key ideas of quantum theory through clever, to-the-point analogies and diagrams. Many physical chemistry students, or just science audience, will welcome this plain approach of the subject. Landmark concepts such as operators, postulates, Pauli principle, Bohr-Einstein debate and Bell's theorem are covered with a lucid and thoughtful account."
1,Heart of cinema darkness,"While this movie is titled Journey to the Center of the Earth, you'd never know that it was based on Jules Verne's book of that title. It's a slow, boring journey to the center of something, with a few birds and a plesiosaur - no dinosaurs - and a few hairy people. By the time the cast meets the natives, the movie becomes more like a bad remake of Heart of Darkness, with a grizzled explorer ruling over the natives. Only that ends pretty quickly. On top of this, the acting is lousy and a teenage boy provides utterly useless narration (as if we needed him to tell us when a guy and girl are flirting). The only positive thing I can say is that the special effects weren't half bad for a made-for-TV movie. Overall, avoid at all costs."
2,Spellbinding!,"If you`re an audiophile, you`ll be disappointed in the audio in 1st 2 books, BUT STILL, this does not detract from the riveting, spellbinding tale that John Jakes has woven. 5th disc, book III, has superb audio. Dramatis personae are as though they really lived the years covered. You will not be disappointed watching this epic."
2,emotionally gripping characters,"I have enjoyed Goodkind's other books in the Sword of Truth Series, but I loved Temple of the Winds. The irony is that at one point I was so mad at the way the story was progressing I could have literally thrown the book down and written my own ending, but I wanted to know what actually happened. Goodkind's characters are so real and vividly described that I truly cared what happened to them. I don't remember the last time I felt that way about a book I was reading. Goodkind is also excellent at showing how good or evil his characters are, not just telling. He shows how evil the villians are, but there deeds and how much they enjoy their twisted acts. I highly recommend this book, even if you have not read the previous three books in this series."
2,Good Movie,Bale has been the best Batman. The story was a little long in the middle. Overall an excellent superhero movie.
1,Rusted after one week.,"We purchased this kettle to replace our old enamel-coated Kitchen Aid kettle that had started to rust inside. We assumed that since it was stainless it would not rust. This kettle started rusting inside after only one week of use. Obviously NOT stainless steel. Plus, I could tell that the kettle purchased years ago was superior in craftmanship compared to the current model. Our Kitchen Aid stand mixer is all that it should be, but I will stay away from Kitchen Aid accessories and lower end products from now on."
1,Beware that it does not work for all Chryslers,"I've got 04 Chrysler Sebring convertible and this harness doesn't fit the factory plug in any form , shape orfashion. I will never again buy harness' through the internet. I will go to best buy as I've now learned my lesson for things you can't see don't buy unless your absolutely certain something will fit."
2,This book is very insightful and helpful.,I have taught this book in adult Sudnay School with excellent results. The book is structured in a way that makes teaching easy! I recommend it highly!
2,pretty good,"I love BTBAM, and this album doesnt fail to fulfill my high expectations. Every song on this album is a keeper... well, every song except for the 3 instrumentals. Having a full length with only 8 ""songs"" is somewhat of a drag, but those 8 songs are amazing nevertheless. I just wish BTBAM would make an album with less fillers and more keepers. This album does however experiment with much more use of keyboards.If you liked their last two releases, youll love this one."
2,GREAT PRODUCT,This is my second order for this product. I am a young 72 year old and I definitely would recommend this product.
1,Waste of Money,"We bought this test kit to determine my husband's blood type since I am Rh negative and pregnant. The lancet was useless, it didn't produce enough blood for one circle--and we only needed two circles (antigen D and control). Save your money or get a lancet with deeper gauge--that might work better."
1,Poor fit and cheaply made,"The retaining clip (the part which holds my Treo 650 in place) snagged on the memory card every time I pulled the phone out of the holster, usually ejecting the memory card. Of course every time the memory card went flying I would have to search for it -- not a way to impress others that I am technically savvy. Even worse, the retaining clip broke off after 2 months of use. Needless to say the holster's pieces are now in the trash where they belong. Don't buy this item, even if you like the low price: you'll end up wasting your money."
2,Hip Hop Classic,"This was, without a doubt, one of the best hip hop albums of the year. Jay Z is most clever lyricist around when it comes to bringing ""the game"" to music. This is album that you must keep in your rotation."
1,Good Tool,"Had an electric power washer for years.bought this one because of the reviews.Tried it out around the house and I was fully satisfied.Has plenty of power and I like the features that it brings.For the money this is a good power washer,I would recommend it."
2,Crystal Growing Science Kit,"This was a gift to my grandson and he was mesmerized and could not wait to start growing the crystals. I told him I did something like that when I was a child, grew rock formations in a fish bowl."
2,Captured songs,"As life on the land sinks into the western sunset, these lonely songs sung by rural women may be all that's left."
2,"Question for current owenrs,","I recently bought these headphones. My question is have any one of you changed the batteries on these? I don't see any battery chamber or anything like that. And if you have changed the batteries, are they special or regular rechargable AA batteries?Your response is appreciated.Thanks."
2,really entertaining film,"You really have to watch this movie carefully. Otherwise, you will lose the magic and just feel really bored with it."
2,MY DAUGHTER LEARNED ITALIAN FROM THIS COURSE!,"My daughter (who is a University of Wisconsin student) is studying in Rome this year. She didn't have time to take a formal Italian course before leaving so a friend suggested she try a Language Dynamics course. She did and she started speaking the language right away. She has since learned a lot more of course by conversing with the natives and taking a university Italian for Foreigners course, but she says she owes her 'beginning' to this course."
1,Tastes awful and not sure working,"Ok, so I admit, I've noticed that all teas promising to increase my milk supply taste nasty. So I don't think it's the teas fault. I think it's just the natural herbs that increase lactation don't taste good to me. I also can't notice a difference when I take it and when I don't. And when I do take it, I try to drink 3 cups of this stuff a day. Gross."
1,Version 5 unusable,"As of March 25 I'm having the same experience as others here: SD does catch problems other scanners miss, and can successfully remove some infestations other products do not. However while Ver 4 worked properly, with the real-time protection enabled Ver 5 slowed all three of my fully patched XP SP2 systems to the point where they are unusable, then eventually freezes the system. My advice is that if you MUST use this product to removed a specific infection you enable it for that specific purpose than immediately disable it afterwards."
2,REVIEW ON FAMILY MEMBER WITH CANCER,"One True ThingTHIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT THE VERY REAL ANGER IN A FAMILY TRYING TO COPE WITH THE CANCER THAT A MOTHER HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH. SAD, BUT VERY POINENT , A VERY TRUE AND HEARTBREAKING STORY THAT A LOT OF FAMALIES GO THRU ."
2,Very good product.,Product arrived in a good shape and it arrived very early.. I am certainly going to buy more stuff from them.
2,Heat in a Can?,This product is great for taking the chill and heating up a room. I have a sun gel fireplace in my bedroom. It takes about 20 minutes but a can of this will have the chill gone and the room warm.
2,Wonderous Wilburys,"If you are the least bit a Traveling Wilburys fan, this is a must have. The music is fantastic . . . the DVD is excellent. There was a lot of forethought put into this project. You will not be sorry at all if you purchase this package."
2,Classic,This movie is a classic and I was unable to find it in local stores. Price wasn't bad and you get all 3 copies.
1,Terrible Film!,"I couldn't get past the first five minutes before I shut it off. Being a mother, it was completely horrific to me to see a real baby being used to act out this part. Who lets their child be laid on a pile of fish guts naked and screaming for a movie?? The real kicker for me was when the children tried to suffocate the baby. I'm sorry, no. I don't want to see that in any movie - that truly is a nightmare for me! My mommy instincts kicked in and all I wanted to do was protect the baby, and it completely turned me off to anything else that might have been interesting or thought-provoking in the movie."
1,Not worth the time nor the money,"This book reads more like a collection of randomly assembled notes than a historical treatise. The narrative wanders over more than a millennium and tries to embrace cultural, religious, and biomedical history within the space of 200 pages. It does not succeed in any aim. I was frankly astounded that the author, who enjoys a good reputation as a historian of the Medieval period, would put his name to such a poorly executed effort.This was not worth the time nor the money."
2,Fantastic,"This series is fantastic. I used to watch the Twillight zone marathon every new years eve, and came on amazon to try and see how much it would cost to buy the whole series. I had recieved this as a christmas present so now I have the first season and Cannot wait to add on!"
2,Odd Packaging. Good Film Clips,"I'm not sure why they decided to put the phrase ""Korea Goes To War"" on the front box of this DVD, since it's really about America going to war in Korea, but that's my only complaint about this product and I think that's a minor complaint. There are many, many newsreals on here that take you from the start of the conflict, into the heart of the war and then end with the peace negotiations. It shows you how very different Korea was than Vietnam - which many people seem to forget these days. This was teh last war america was really proud of and I'm glad I got the chance to learn more about it."
2,<<< FUNNY! >>>,"This was definitely some of Paul's most hilarious comedy!I've watched it over & over and I am cracking up every time.In fact, I need to buy another tape because I think I haveworn out the one that I own. Definitely worth buying or atleast see it once!"
2,My favorite of the Edward Eager books,"I'm a big Edward Eager fan, and this is my favorite of his. Something about the setting of this book is extra-magical to me. The children spend the summer in a beautiful old house by the sea that has a large garden filled with all different kinds of thyme that can magically transport the kids to various times and places. The plays on words are cute, the Natterjack is a great character, and their adventures are fun...including a trip to visit the March family from Little Women. All-around great book!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Jay Sherbondy is a con man and a convicted felon that through various schemes has suckered people out of 10's of thousands of dollars. He has no formal training as a psychologist. He self-published this book and lied about his other publications (there are none). Don't waste you money. For more info see: www.geocities.com/stop_jay_sherbondy
2,DR Quinn medicine woman season three volume four,"Episode one,The first Chrismas,A jewish peddler and his family arrive in Colorado springs.Episode two,Indian agent,Sully takes a job as a indian agent.Episode three,The end of the world,A newspaper article predicting that a comet will strike the earth.Episode four,Pikes peace,mike finds a kindred sprit in a retired schoolteacher named Sam."
2,good read,Fun read for the ladies looking to relive the dating scene. Some parts make me happy I'm happily married while others make me super happy! The story is meant to be fun and laugh out loud funny though so overall it's a good book.
2,Very pleased,"Needed a simple tea bag holder to display tea at church. This is perfect. Arrived quickly & in excellent condition. Have already placed an order for additional boxes for friends who admired it. Tea bag envelopes do stand up straight, and there is adequate space for 6 different varieties. An excellent item for its purpose."
1,"Old school RPG, indeed","This game is a grind-fest with practically zero story. I felt like I was playing a primitive RPG. I will admit it is one of few RPGs I have played that is truly challenging.I am not sure why this is on the DS. Besides the draw your own map idea the game makes no use of its power. There is almost no animation. You never see your characters except in a portrait in menus. Battle is represented by an enemy portrait being assaulted by a flash and either a yellow slash or maybe a lightning bolt. The rest of the game is done by exploring a 3D maze first-person style sometimes avoiding a glowing ball that represents a tougher enemy or navigating menus in town.If you like true old school gaming on the go this game is for you. If you want a more evolved game with more substance, I don't recommend this one."
2,Porsche Fan,"As a long time fan and witness to many 956/962 racing wins, and one who has met some of the drivers mentioned in this book, I highly recommend this book to Porsche racing fans. One of the surprising aspects of the book is its insights into the personalities and technologies that played out during their dominance of this era. Very insightful and informative, lots of quotes from drivers, engineers, CEO's and designers too. Many color pictures adds to the enjoyment !"
2,A True American Original,"Paul Thorn caught me totally by surprise a few years ago as an opening act when he came out with only his guitar and voice and wrapped the whole room around his finger. I caught him a couple of years later with his full band and it was a religious experience. I have attended thousands of live shows, starting in 1970, and I would put that show in my personal top 20! This DVD, with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band, comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can. The sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time. Paul has found the ultimate blend of rock, blues, gospel, classic R&B; and country. He and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that's exceedingly rare anymore. The DVD and bonus live CD are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find. You need to see this man's band live, but if you can't, buy this DVD and crank it up!-Billy Rollings"
1,next to worthless,Baum's bio seems to have vanished from Wikipedia. Last I saw it there I don't think there was any mention of any training as an economist. I believe she majored in movie criticism at university. Her columns at Bloomberg seem mainly reactionary pieces of misinformation. Whenever I checked out her assertions vs. the data she didn't come out well. I think she has lots of far right wing opinions and not much knowledge of economics to back them up. I am not taken in.
1,Pointless,"A friend recommended thsi movie to me, promising a lot of laughs. I found it juvenile and pointless."
2,Left for Dead extended life 10 years,"My husband extended his life 7 years beyond what medical doctors predicted. Cayenne is from God, of course. He heals."
2,Great replacement.,"Just like the original. get it. However mine said Ultrasonic, which is not shown in the picture. Lame but oh well."
1,buying through amazon will VOID WARRANTY ...compressor break after 4 months,"After only 4 months of sporadic use the tank pressure gauge stopped functioning, so no automatic switch off at full pressure...and the release valve rubber gasket had evaporated and leaked permanently.Amazon will not take it back and DeWalt - Porter Cable's parent company says warranty is limited. In the best scenario you would have to drive out to a remote repair shop. But when I told them I bought it through Amazon they said NO WARRANTY for ANYTHING sold by Amazon. Apparently they are trying to stop Amazon from selling. Amazon is not an authorized reseller...and that in DeWalt's book voids the warranty.I will stay away from both Amazon and Dewalt/ porter Cable and Black and Decker and Stanley products in the future. I feel I got screwed by both companies - Amazon for not telling and Dewalt for enforcing such a ridiculous rule."
2,Dark and grimy rock classic,"This is the first album by Glenn Danzig's second band samhain. This is not The Misfits at all! Instead a dark dreary sound that is so unique it really defies all labeling. Could this album be considered heavy metal? Punk? Crossover? All of the above? None of the above? Yes!! I like to think of the sound of this album as a dark and dirty punk/metal crossover with melodic songs and nice tempos. Of course, the horrid production quality ADDS to the charm of this jewel of an album. Though cheesy-seeming don't be fooled. This album can give you nightmares if you listen to it enough late at night with the lights down. Trust me. There is magic in the music. BLACK magic!!...Very unique, very AWESOME. Buy it!! 5 stars.`"
1,Sounds like a dying cat,Nothing ruins a good jazz song like Keith Jarrett making dying cat noises to the tune.
2,This CD Sounds Like A Great Vacation,"After hearing Sara sing on an NPR program, I decided to look her up and order her cd. It was a great decision on my part. This cd now has me thinking about visiting Cape Verde and hearing more of this beatiful music."
2,"12"" Scanpan","Scanpans are the best non-stick pans available. Ceramic/titanium is just as non-stick as Teflon, but since it's not a coating there is no flaking, and metal utensils are okay to use on it. It even gets seasoned over time, unlike Teflon. Had the 8"" pan for a few years and loved it, but now the 12"" is the most used pan in the kitchen (it's HUGE)."
2,"""Delicious"" and Fantastic Buy!","The recipes in here are true to the Ben & Jerry's products you find on the frozen section of your grocery store! I easily achieved amazing results with the recipes they provided. (Try the Peanut Butter Fudge Ribbon variation- you will not believe it!). This book is very pratical and written with great humour.I strongly recommend this book to the novice with a sense of adventure as well as for the more experienced Ice Cream epicurian.Sincerely.Blanche, Montreal QC"
2,Murder of A Marriage,"This is a quiet, well-written novel about a happy marriage in a small town and what happens when something unexpected happens to change the entire landscape. The story shifts perspective, which I sometimes find distracting, but worked pretty smoothly here. I will be interested in reading more of Hoffman's work, which has somehow eluded me thus far. If you're interested in more of what I'm reading and recommending, check out my book blog at allthepage.today.com."
1,Review of Mirror and Poor Customer Service,"I received this product as a birthday gift. The lighting was very poor.Further, when obtaining information about a return to this vendor, I received an email that said, if the mirror was in pristine condition and in original packing they would consider refunding the money less a re-stocking fee. Nowhere in the product information is a re-stocking fee mentioned. They did do a refund but charged a re-stocking fee of $10.00. Additionally, I had to pay $12 in postage to return it."
2,"Greatmusic, good show Worth seeing for Coleen Sexton","Although David Hasselhoff's acting can be laugh-out-loud funny a times, the show itself is pretty good. There are some incredible songs: Someone Like You, In His Eyes, A New Life. If I could only give you one reason to see this video, it's because of Coleen Sexton's unforgettable performance as Lucy Harris. She is one of the most talented people I've ever seen. She is way better than Linda Eder from the original cast. All of her songs are the high points in the show, the parts you won't want to stop watching. The rest of the show is alright. If you're into Broadway, I'd say this is worth seeing."
2,The ultimate feel-good movie,"This is one of my ultimate ""feel-good"" movies. If I'm feeling down or blue, all I have to do is pop this into the VCR and I'm soon feeling chipper again. Just hearing the theme song can cheer me up. Maybe it's because this movie came out the year I turned 16 and it reminds me of a happier, simpler time in the U.S. Two of my favorites, Dom De Luise and Paul Lynde, are charming and hillarious as supporting cast.I agree: this SHOULD DEFINITELY be put out in DVD in widescreen! Extra features such as an interview with and commentary by Doris Day would make this a true collector's edition. Anyone listening?"
2,Best book in the world,"Kurt Vonnegut was the most brilliant mind alive at the turn of the century. It is an utter shame that he died recently, but so it goes. In my opinion, this is his finest work. He satorically questions religion, war and the nature of man all in one hillarious masterpeice. He is the Mark Twain of the 1900's. I recomend EVERYONE read this novel."
1,Avoid this product,"My son purchased this unit for me for Christmas. First used it in March, and initally had no issues. Transmitter failed to connect to receiver once, but a reset solved the problem.In the middle of a BBQ on July 4th, probe starts reporting a temp of 199F just after starting a roast.Tech support troubleshoots and advises the probe is bad, they will ship a replacement under warranty and I should receive with a week. Two weeks pass, I call back. Probe is on backorder will be shipped mid-August. End of August, no probe, call back and they say it will be November. They are having a problem with probes, do not have replacement parts, and continue to sell the item although they cannot back it up."
1,bad,"have you ever watched a bad movie and there was that guy who kept kicking himself in the head and laughing in disbelief at the blatany stupidity. this is how schom talks the whole time, and you have to listen. good events though, although i dont know if he left anything out. read this and then an account from a different author."
2,Great resource for physical exams.,"For any beginning practioner this book can't be beat. It is easy to use and understand. It shows how to do all aspects of a physical exam, along with taking a complete and accurate history."
1,This book has far too little material in it to cost so much,For the price of the book I felt that it should contain much more detailed informantion on computer science.
2,Best book of the '90's!,"For all those 35+ women out there, who drooled over thePartridge Family, and Dave's picture on Tiger Beat, this is a mustread! Dave bears all, tells all, and reveals all. From his relationship with his father, to his relationship with Susan Dey. Reading ""C'mon Get Happy"" gave me a whole new love and respect for David Cassidy. I know it's out of print, but find it in an auction if you have to! Or visit a library. It's easy to read and easy to get wrapped up in."
2,great singer great albums,this man was without doubt one of the best singersar ound. these 2 lps are brilliant. buy this andany other john gary cd.
2,Upgraded Sears Contractor Saw,"I ordered the 30"" fence to upgrade my Sears 10"" Contractors Saw. Installation was straight forward. I recommend buying the 30"" extension table. The extension table required me to create some blocks under the supports to level the table with the saw. The installation was straighforward with no problems. When you upgrade you will have to remount the on/off switch. The Fence provides two treaded holes that you can use along with a 6"" piece of right angle aluminum. Fence is dead on accurate and brought new life to an old saw."
1,One door away from boredom,"I have read most, if not all of Dean Koontz's novels and have loved just about every one of them. However, I found this one the most boring of all and couldn't wait until the end. I usually can read his novels in a short amount of time, but this one I found hard to pick up night after night. Nice try, can't wait for his next one, hope it's better than this."
1,Disappointing sound and broke after 6 months.,I don't get all the great reviews. When I first got these I intended to return them but never got around to it. They just broke after 6 months and I only used them in the gym 4 days a week for an hour or so. They aren't terrible but sound tinny. I only paid $10 for them so I didn't expect greatness but I can't say that these sound better than the stock ipod buds.
1,Awful for skin!!!!!! Does not work!,"Do NOT waste your money on this! I am 28 years old and have always had oily/problem skin. The benzoyl peroxide in the face wash and ""day cream"" burn and sting when you apply. Also you can't realistically apply the day cream during the day as it leaves a messy white residue on your face. My face never felt clean using this product and I continued to break out. I would use the spot treatment on existing treatments and I would have to say that is the only semi good product they offer: it dries up an existing pimple faster as opposed to using nothing at all. If you expect this to stop your acne it won't, benzoyle peroxide is awful for yous skin and known to cause thin skin and premature aging. As a side note I have started using Lerosett, an organic clay mask/face wash skin care line and let me tell you it is amazing! I have cystic acne and it works. If you are looking for something on the cheaper side try Aztec healing clay, does wonders. :)"
1,Just Another Trail Log,"After the high praise and 5-star rating of the other reviewers, I expected much more than just another AT thru-hike trail log. Logs of similar, if not better, quality can be found on numerous Internet sites. For a published work, I expected to see a lot more depth on Trail history, interesting people encountered and creative insights. Even the 8-12 photos at the start of each chapter were black and white! The text meanders from day to day, becoming increasingly repetitive as the chapters pile up. On the plus side, I did get a few insights into the VT/NH section I'll be hiking this fall that go beyond what is available in the guidebook.In retrospect, this book might appeal more to readers with limited long-distance hiking experience. Hmmm, perhaps I should publish my Trail notes?"
1,STyle over substance,"While this is a stunning graphic accomplishment, it's no ""Twin Peaks"" in terms of plot development. I confess that I *thought* it was a real story---I believe I saw a blurb on amazon that led me to believe this before it was published. Imagine my disappointment when I realized it's really just a glorified scrapbook with a flimsy plot. Ho-hum...this is one of those books that I wouldn't mind browsing through in a book store, but I bought it sight unseen so I only have myself to blame."
1,OK,"I was glad to find a copy of this book containing the play I wanted to read. It arrived in timely fashion. It is in decent condition.To Amazon:WHY DO YOU FORCE THIS REVIEWING PROCESS SO STRONGLY? TO MY WAY OF THINKING, NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS. I WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE TO SPEND TIME DOING THIS. EXCELLENT NEWS AND REALLY BAD NEWS MAKES MOST SENSE."
1,Lousy Binding,"I've read all but ""A Christmas Carol"" in this edition. I've found several typos. Moreover, the binding is becoming unglued. I estimate by the time I finish ""A Christmas Carol"" the binding will be totally exposed. I value permanent books (otherwise I would buy paperbacks). I suggest anyone who enjoys Dickens buy a better edition."
1,Gets boring fast,"The workout is repetitive and gets boring very fast especially if you are used to high-paced workouts. Leisa Hart narrates with a too peppy and somewhat condescending tone which gets annoying.The yoga section is not neccessarily yoga and has no calming results.I suggest Prenatal Yoga for an interesting, great workout in any stage of pregnancy!"
1,Beware of ToolKing,"If you expect to buy these new in the package, you will be disappointed. ToolKing offers cheap prices by reselling you returned merchandise (I suspect)from their retail stores. I received my batteries used, you can tell by the brass connection points being ruffed up, and not in their original packages. One of the batteries takes forever to charge and this may be why it was returned. I also ordered a charger (not in the orig Package) where they were nice enough to place a crappy ToolKing inventory sticker over the vent holes. You know, the kind that peels off flake by flake. They dont return emails or phone calls. I was ripped off, so beware!"
2,Nature 101 aka Poetry of the Enviroment,"Anyone that has spent anytime in the great ourdoors, be it hunting, fishing or just observing nature, will find something to identify with in Wrigley's poems. He reaches a part of us long ago forgotten and touches our primitive soul, igniting our memory like the wind whipping at a dying coal. Highly recommended."

1,Buyers beware!,"After reading the good reviews here and the cheap price, I decided to buy this monitor. I plugged in the monitor with the DVI cable and turned it on and the picture looked great except when I pressed the menu button a scrambled box came up, all of the menus are scrambled colored boxes!I tried the regular analog cables and its the same. Also when I booted the computer up the next day, half of the screen had my Windows desktop and the other half was black. It took another 20-30 seconds before the full Windows screen loaded, this has never happened before with my old monitor."
1,Very Dissapointed,There wasn't much to this book at all. I was very dissapointed in it. Did not find helpfull at all.
1,i understand how the nannie of a wealthy family would like it but i didn't!,"it was boring. characters, and relationships between characters, were poorly constructed and by the end i didn't care about any of them. no emotional involvement."
1,Plastic grinder not substantial,"I should have read more reviews, but I was in a hurry and the product description said ""Medical-grade, stainless-steel components"". I had one previously that was stainless. This one is not. The grinder is plastic and would not stand up to grinding anything but soft foods which can be easily mashed without it. The description should be changed to be more accurate. It was returned."
1,"Defective item, Seller won't respond","I purchased this camera as a birthday present. Once I got it, I found out that I had to spend even more money in order to even get the thing on and working- I had to buy a battery, charger, memory card, and USB cord. I purchased and waited for the additional items only to find that the camera didn't work. After a little online research, I found that the red dot that came up instead of taking a picture was a common problem for this camera and costs between $150-$200 to fix. I contact the seller OVER A MONTH ago to arrange a refund and I am still waiting on a response. I use amazon a lot and this is my first bad experience."
2,This CD Rocks!!,"Ocean Avenue is completly great in every way. For example, the band isn't your normal, average punk band. They worked a violin into their already talented band. With each song, you find more respect towards Yellowcard as artists and musicians. Their lyrics produce messages that can relate to the listener, and also entertain them with their upbeat, ""pop-punk"" ways. The members of Yellowcard fit so well together, and you can tell in their music. This cd defeats ALL prior to it, and will remain remembered for quite some time. This is DEFINATELY worth the time and money."
1,Four hours that I'll never see again,"I read The Testament this past weekend. This was my first John Grisham book, and I was not familiar with his writing style. Two chapters into the book, I found the characters shallow and the premise anemic. These perceptions did not improve with time. I skimmed through the last three chapters to save time, and tossed the book into the corner when I was finished.I'm not a fan of the legal genre, and I found the repeated usage of terms like, ""holographic will"" and ""testamentary capacity"" boring. Okay, it's cool that you know what those words mean. You know what's even cooler? Using them just once, and letting people look up the darned things if they can't follow along. Repeating them over and over just makes it sound like you're trying to work the Word of the Day into your life.In short, I would not recommend this book. And, given the previous reviews that this is Mr. Grisham's finest work, I would not recommend any book within his collection."
2,"Solid, Biblical Advice","I've read several books on leadership, and this one is now near the top of my most-favored list. It is very readable, yet profound. The author condenses a wealth of timeless principles into approximately 200 pages.Most readers nowadays are familiar with the notion of servant leadership, so Wilkes' principles are not new. What is refreshing is the fresh way he communicates those principles. My favorite aspect of this work is the servant-sayings scattered throughout the pages. For example, the author remarks, ""You will never become a servant leader until you first become a servant to the Leader."" Another excerpt says, ""You are not the leader until the group you are leading says so."" A third quote reads, ""Servant leaders humble themselves and wait for God to exalt them.""This book was highly recommended to me, and I in turn recommend it to all Christian leaders."
2,worth it owning,"well written and illustrated, how to capture water and store it safely. Found another book on how to keep it fresh and alive ionically."
2,Artemis Soars!,"From the beginning Artemis has dazzled me with his quandary. And now I'm afraid to end the book, still stuck slowly reading Chapter 7... Please, I beg you readers to STOP comparing this book and every other childen's book that comes our way to Harry Potter! Please... J.K. Rowling's boy wizard is great and original, and so is Eoin Colfer's child prodigy. Just becuase it's labled as a children's read does not mean it has to be overwhelmed with magic and such. Every heard of Liminey Slicket? (did I spellt hat right?) anyway... This is an amazing voice not only in children's lit, but in science fiction as well. It doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars. Can't wait for the movie."
2,She's awesome!,I love all of her music! Her messages are so positive and uplifting and they help me to refocus my thoughts and to look on the brighter side!
2,Traffic Jam,AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I love everything about Traffic. These guys can really hang after all these years. Get it!!
1,Nikon Coolpix 775 - Software Issues are Huge,"Nice little camera with lots of features. But don't let that fool you.There's a huge range of current computers with which the camera is essentially incompatable - my 1-year-old Dell Dimension, a widely distributed name-brand model - is an example. And the incompatibility in some cases is complete - no downloads are available to fix.We'd expect better of Nikon's software team. And as the issue is widespread, Nikon's customer service team has let the consumer down as well, by failing to identify the potential issues on the box..... My advice if you buy this - spend the extra to buy from a name outlet (about $75-$100 more), make sure you understand their return policy, and test the full range of functionality as soon as you get home."
1,Flawed count down timmer. Timex Men's Digital Sport Watch T5H091,I returned it to Amazon. The count down timer feature does not reset to the original start time. You have to manually reset the count down timer every time. That will never work for me for my refereeing.
1,HORRID BOOK,"THIS IS A SELF PROFITING SALESMAN ATTEMPTING TO CASH IN ON SELLING HIS PRODUCTS. IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE ""SUPERFOOD"" DRINK WHEATGRASS. AN ARROGANT MENTAL CASE WHO IS FULL OF HIMSELF WITH MAIL ORDER DIME-A-DOZEN NON-CREDENTIALS. THIS IS A BOOK THAT FULL ON NOTHING TANGIBLE EXCEPT THE INAPT WRITER AND HIS EGO."
1,Watson ranks with the worst,"Russell Watson is not a competent singer. His singing on this poorly produced album ranks with the very worst that I've ever heard on records. In fact, listening to Watson's shaky singing, one can't help but feel that such a record will only cause a further decline in the standands of performance as well as music appreciation.To release recordings so such poor quality is an act to be denounced"
2,Entertaining,"I thought the premise was cool, the vampires in this book was pretty hot and what I expect vampires to be. I'd buy another book from this author. Another great book is The Guilty Innocent by D.N. Simmons which also deals with a female heroine with psychic abilities."
2,God Sent,"If you've ever been bitten by a tick or fleas, then you'll completely understand the need for treatment & prevention of such pests. If your serious about that notion then you will want Frontline Plus. It Works. Guaranteed. Frontline Plus, for people who seriously don't want to deal with fleas....and also for people who actually care about their cat's health & well-being. seriously, if you don't buy this, you don't love your cat. Vote Bob Dole"
2,A good compromise,"I remember this from the double LP at the Jazz School where I trained. The Basie Bands swings like you can't believe and Sinatra's singing is golden. The thing that made it memorable for me though is his patter. Genuine laugh out loud stuff. Here the CD has been compressed into fewer tracks and a lot of that glorious patter edited out. There is one fantastic monologue though, so short of finding a copy of the double LP this is a good compromise."
1,DONT BUY ONE.,THE HONDA I GOT WORKED FOR 20 MINS AND THEY WILL NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY OR GIVE YOU CREDIT SO DONT BUY ONE THEY DONT WORK 200.00 GONE FOR JUKE.
2,the first of a kind rock band straight out of seattle,"seattle really doesn't have much to remember its music scene by except for about as many fingers as I have on one hand...Heart, Mix-a-lot, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters..those are the biggest names out of here anyway...Heart is what I consider the pioneer of Seattle music...sure seattle seems boring and it is but I'm proud to have a few good people like the ones named above represent my city..Heart is what I would hear on the radio growing up...I can't say I'm a die hard Heart fan but when I'm in the right mood I will kick back with this album and take a long drive in the rain and listen all the way through...Heart is one group that could never possibly fall off the face of the earth...heart is known to everyone at one time or another"
2,Couldn't Be Served Better,"British Comedy is like fine Scotch, it's an aquired taste; and some people never do aquire the taste. I love british comedy and ""Are You Being Served?"" is an excelent example. This collection is well done, quality recordings, neatly packaged and reasonably priced."
2,Raquela a Woman of Israel,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was historical, easy reading and educational while telling a great story. Was really surprised when I learned that it was a true story,, and enjoyed the photos at the end of the book"
2,This movie is beautiful.,"^^That pretty much says it all. The plot is interesting and engaging as well, but by far I just love the beautiful use of colors to portray moods and feelings in this movie."
1,Misleading product name,"Seeing how spray products have worked in other markets (spray butter, spray salad dressing, spray hair gel) I thought that this product would be a convenient way to apply lube without getting a nasty mess everywhere from putting it on.I was wrong. KY let me down. The lube does not come out from the bottle as a ""fine mist"" as what might be expected. Instead, it comes out in a forceful stream that splatters whatever it hits and gets everything around it messy.As a matter of convenience, you might be better served taking the spray top off and simply pouring the lube from the bottle the old-fashioned way. This gimmick simply doesn't work."
1,disappointing,"I've had these glasses @ a year and a half and they are starting to get condensation between the dual walls, and in 2 of the glasses - water between the walls. Don't waste your money."
1,Extremely poor design,"I recently purchased a CuisinartCuisinart DCG-20N Coffee Bar Coffee Grinder, White. I bought it because my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee maker did not grind the coffee fine enough for my taste and there is no way to adjust it.The DCG-20N coffee grinder is probably the poorest designed coffee grinder I have ever seen. The lid for the grinder fits INSIDE the bowl of the grinder. It is almost impossible to get the lid on once the bowl is filled with coffee beans. You can force the lid on, but then there are coffee beans that are trapped outside the lid between the lid and the casing. Then when you go to pour the ground coffee out, you get some beans that did not get ground at all. Why in the name of all that is sane did you have the lid go INSIDE the casing???If I had not already thrown away the box it came in, I would CERTAINLY have returned it!I bought a Cuisinart grinder expecting a quality product. I certainly did NOT get one with this coffee grinder!"
2,Last Word Game,The Last Word game is worth a try. It keeps the mind sharp. We played it over the holidays with family and enjoyed the board game.
1,Opaque and Dreadful Prose,"Difficult to read this book. Many books on Buddhism are written in this odd, flowery manner. If you don't already read other books on Buddhism, you may find it disorienting."
2,Very sturdy and good for little ones!,"My daughter got this for her birthday 2 or 3 years ago and it is in great shape. She is 5 now and doesn't play with it much anymore, but her younger sister (2 1/2 yrs) is now interested. I love how sturdy it is. The doll is thick wood and the pieces are very thick plastic, it all comes in a nice wooden box. The lid slids off easily though, so I don't recommend that part for travel. We put it in a ziplock for travel. It is easy for a toddler to place the pieces on the doll and mix and match fun. I think it's helpful to have two dolls so Mom or friends can play together. Great dress up doll for younger kids."
2,Extra battery for my Kendle 1.,I didn't need a new battery yet but I wanted to have one on hand so I wouldn't have to wait for one to be shipped when I did need it. I use my Kentle every day and some times several times a day. God bless my 2 children for giving me my Kendle 1 I love it.
2,"Definetly a guilty pleasure, but I'll admit to it","I've been a fan of Hilary Duff since 'Lizzie McGuire' and I think she has great singing talent. She's also a great role model for girls and is a lot better than Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson yada, yadaMy absolute favorite song is 'So Yesterday'. I heard this on the radio at the store the other day and my husband was looking at me like I was nuts because I was singing along and checking out my groceries. See what I mean about guilty pleasures?This is another album that's good for traveling. Although I've gotten yelled at for blasting 'So Yesterday', 'Come Clean' and 'Why Not' Oh sue me, I'm 21 and a huge Hilary fan! My husband likes some of her songs too but he won't admit it, like it is with a lot of fans.Hilary rocks! Buy this album, it is very worth it!"
1,Not Good...,"If this is going to be a classic in the future, music truly is in a terrible state. I found it to be an ok album, but not the great masterpiece others have indicated. This is definitely one to listen to at a listening station before buying (or listen to some of it here.) Some people think music has to be strange to be good. I think it at least should have some sort of entertainment value. This cd has none. I gave it 2 stars because it isn't the worst cd I've ever heard...just not one of the good ones."
2,Okay for fine hair,"For the price, this flat iron does the job. I have long, thick, fine hair which doesn't always respond well to being straigtened. As long as I also use Kerastase oleo relax slim, this flat iron does the job and keeps my hair straight all day long in the humid Georgia summers."
1,Software Scam,"I purchased this software in July of 2011 but didn't have a chance to install it until I received my new laptop, this January. When I did a complete install, the program wouldn't accept the code printed on the inside of the plastic disc carrier. I contacted the vendor directly and they insisted that my disc was not valid. They would not help me to remedy the problem. It will be a cold day before I ever use any of their products again."
1,And the point is?,"Can a movie be artistic and still have a plot? What is with these movies that have style but no substance? I found HurlyBurly (just like most of these other reveiwers)to be nothing more than just a bunch of great actors babbling about nothing! And I'm sure that I'm not the only one who finds it disgusting whenever they place an adult actor in bed with a actress who is barely out of her teens. If you like your movies to be ""artsy"" and still be watchable, then I recommend ""In the Company of Men"". If you value your time, I suggest that you skip this one."
1,This CD is okay but I wouldn't say great.,"If these are some of the 'best guitarists around of the moment', then I only wish we could go back to the Seventies/Eighties. Like the first review, there isn't exactly anything of highlighted originality going on here. Unless your knowledge of guitaring is limited that is."
1,Borodins books are good but not that good!,"I do hope that the price for that book is a typo. $71.66? You have to be kidding, Oh, I forgot. plus shipping!"
2,Raintree County,I've read this book twice now and it causes me to think and I think I will read it again one day.
1,This is a book about Universalism not Christianity,"I recommend reading John Caddock's review in Journal of the Grace Evangelical Society, Vol. 10, #19 before purchasing this book. According to Caddock, Manning places experientially based learning above scriptural truths instead of using God's Word as sideboards to understanding. Caddock labels Manning's ""contemplative spirituality"" as dangerous. I would tend to agree."
2,Long time user,"I love this lens. I use it on my Canon XT. The range is great for that mid stuff that seems to always come up. The IS does allow me to shoot about one stop darker, as long as my subject isn't the one moving.I do notice a bit of chromatic shift when shooting in high contrast situations."
2,Great Product,"Remodeled half bath and hated to replace existing chrome-plated brass fixtures, but ran into problem with size and placement of brackets on new beveled subway tile. The Moen Monticello matched our faucet and the horizontallly-installed bracket fit perfectly on the tile. Had already purchased another well-rated towel and TP brackets and returned because of their cheap feel... Replacing a solid brass set with a more expensive aluminum set did not feel right. But this set was an excellent weight and cosmetic fit!"
1,Game of Death Review,I bought this movie for my collection. As for the movie I think it is not what you would call a good view. The extras are the best part of this movie.If you are a collector of Bruce Lee's movie this would be part of the collection but other then that you mat be disappointed.
2,does the job!,"awesome sharpener for axes, machetes, and for some knives. i wouldn't use this sharpener on a nice knife because it leaves a pretty rough cut and you could potentially ruin a nice blade. this sharpener cuts a dull edge very quickly and was worth every penny. highly recommended for most sharpening."
2,Expensive but works great!,I used an electric 10 years ago and it was average at best. Since then I've used a blade but had to battle with nicks and razor burn. The 8894XL solved all this as it's nearly as close as a blade but no more razor burn.Shave time is 4-6 minutes and the trimmer works well on sideburns and goatee. I shave nearly everyday and go almost a month between charges.
2,Rust???,"Usually before I make a purchase I like to read reviews to see how a product performs. In this case I'm sort of glad I didn't. When I saw this set it was bought on impulse because I liked its looks and had faith in the Henckels name. However, if I read the reviews complaining of rust I probably would have passed on it. I've used this set as my daily flatware for over a month now & wash it both in the diswasher & by hand. I've yet to see any sign of rust or rust spots whatsoever. The most I've seen are slight water stains & slight scuffing of the very shiny mirror finish. I'm not an expert on flatware, but I wouldn't consider this abnormal. If it's any reflection on my satisfaction I just ordered another 45 piece set so we always have flatware on hand. The set looks and feels good, and is nicely weighted and balanced. I think it's a good everyday flatware set."
2,Thought provoking,"I thought this movie was very well acted. It dealt with some very touchy issues for most people. When David, played by Brendan Fraser, finds out his sister is carrying a baby who will probably be gay it leaves him questioning his own homosexuality. After asking his parents what they would have done if they had know he was gay and getting a very hurtful response he cuts off all ties with them and his sister.It poses the question, ""does my life have meaning?"". Also the issues of genetic testing are explored as well as abortion."
1,There ought'a be a law.............,"Against some people being allowed near a keyboard. This book is the biggest waste of time I've ever seen. Harry might have been the star at IBM, but frankly, I wouldn't want to be the one working on his code. There is virtually nothing to be learned in this book. Maybe - just maybe - a general overview of some of the options out there, but that's about it. And if you're leanings are towards Java, forget it. This is an IBM/CORBA focused book. Get a life Harry. And stay the hell away from the keyboard!"
2,Excellent boot for the hiker/ walker,"I received these boots about six weeks ago and really like them. I always replace the insoles with a more supportive insole. I replaced the hard foam insole with one from Walmart (in the shoe department) - about $9.00. Makes a big difference in comfort. I walk 10-15 miles a day and have had no problems with these boots. Very supportive to the ankles and good fit. I also walk in snow quite often and they have maintained their water proofness so far. My last pair of Timberlands were White Ledge which I have pretty much worn out in the past year. As the heels wear down, I build them back up with Shoe Goo, which gives me many more miles. The only bad thing I can say about the Chocoruas is that I can see that the laces (which are substantial) will soon be frayed due to the metal eyelets (which have a fairly sharp edge). These are well built boots and very comfortable - glad I upgraded from the White Ledge."
1,"Bought ""new"" got used","The discs aren't even playable. I got played. Scratches everywhere. This'll teach me to shop online just to ""save"" $40 instead I wasted $80."
2,Easy and cheap way of injecting CO2 into a small tank,"I bought this for a 5G nano planted tank and it's perfect for that size. Following the directions I used distilled water at 85 degrees with the included packets. At first there will be a lot of air stuck in the diffuser and it won't dissolve much because there's not much CO2 in there. But after 48 hours the diffuser is clear and the fermentation is generating about 6 large bubbles (about the size of a chickpea) per minute. The diffuser dissolves about 90% of a bubble before it gets to the surface. According to my drop checker my CO2 is between 20-30ppm now, and my plants are looking very nice! It's also fun to just stare at the bubbles traveling up the diffuser, getting smaller as they go; my fish likes to stare at them too!The one downside I can see is that the diffuser is rather large and curious fish WILL try to squeeze into it and get stuck."
2,Just as advertised,"Product worked just as advertised for our 46"" LCD TV. Made of quality material, simple to hang on the wall, and easy to adjust tilt. Would definitely buy again for other TV's."
2,Sweat!,I have been stepping for some time now and found this video to be clear and easy to follow with alot of basic moves. It definitely was a workout and I am drenched when I finish. The moves are not too complicated so a beginner could follow along but you also get a work out if you have been stepping for awhile.
1,"After trouble-free year, AUDIO PROBLEMS!","The video-editing component of this package, Video Wave, worked great for me for about a year, but it has recently turned into a NIGHTMARE! The audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video, and after trying everything I'm convinced that its a problem with the code. A quick product search will show others who have had similar problems. I would STAY AWAY!"
1,"Way over-rated, better choices out there, first one defective","Bought this after reading the early ratings here and on Cnet. First one replaced under warranty, company was just OK to work with but a pain to return and cost me shipping. Have tried/tested NUMEROUS BT headsets. The ""environmental mode"" is a total gimmick and in my opinion - worthless. For the money, the Plantronics 510 can't be beat, if you don't mind the bulk or the Plantronics 925 if you don't mind sacrificing a little sound quality to get smaller size."
1,not GOOD,"this product is only good for dwarf hamsters a large hamster will not fit in the tubing, also they dont ship ups only USPS and the package got so beat up it arrived in pieces if you want this for your dwarf its fabulous just order from a different place."
2,Sesame Oil Review,The purchase of this sesame oil was a winner! We're enjoying it and feeling like we aren't breaking the bank each time we use it. No one is complaining of the taste being too strong. We'll repeat the purchase. Amazon sold a winner!
1,Talk about a downer of a book!!,I found this book depressing and the characters in it so self-absorbed that it was hard to have empathy for any of them.
1,Died quickly,"I bought this vacuum for my small apartment with all wood floors. At first the product worked well: it cleaned maybe 85% of the dust and dirt off the floors and spread the rest around, but it was good enough for $50.Soon, the suction stopped being as effective, the brush meant to clean carpets was riddled with hair that I could not remove, and the filter - which I emptied every time I cleaned - had some metal piece that broke off. It still worked to some degree though.After eleven months of use, the vacuum died. It no longer turns on, and therefore doesn't work! Yes, a $50 vacuum is a great deal, but I'd rather have purchased a more expensive product that would have lasted a few years (maybe even close to ten...) instead of dying so quickly.I don't recommend this product, not only because of its untimely death, but also because while alive it didn't do its job very well."
2,Regular Comb,"I think the mason person detangling comb is pretty expensive for just a regular comb. I have natural kinky-curly hair. The comb has fine teeth, I think I should have gone with the other comb with wider teeth. I generally use this one after I have already detangled with a larger tooth comb just to remove any additional shed hair."
1,Stick With Basketball C Webb,"Man!! I love C Webb and his game, been with him since Country Day in D, BUT, dude hasno flow man. He sounds like he needs some caffeine or prozac or something. Gangsta Gangsta is nice and so are the flows on the Redman track but thats it. The songs Chris sings by himself are repetitive, BUT I still love my dawg man and I ain't playa hatin', just callin it how I hear it. Anyway, buy this CD for 2 songs and show your loyalty to Webb anyhow!"
1,Not a good product,"I don't recommend these at all. Many years ago when this product first was introduced, it did a pretty good job. However, now it just doesn't touch anything symptomatic of allergy problems. All they have in this is 1,000mg of Tylenol, which is hard on your liver, 60mg of pseudoephedrine, and the allergy medication which is not Benadryl. This stuff will mildly clear your head of stuffiness, but it does nothing to block allergy symptoms or get rid of the pain. My chest was so tight that I could hardly breathe. You would think all that Tylenol would do SOMETHING but that is not the case. I had to come back home and take Advil to shrink the swelling in my head and then take Claritin to get rid of the allergy symptoms. Save your money on this one - grab the Advil Allergy version of this - your swelling will cease and the allergy portion will be much more relieved. I don't recommend this at all."
2,Zelda - A Long Time Coming,"Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the best Zelda came to his consoles since Super Nintendo'sThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.I'm not going to write this review for noobs. For you die-hard Zelda fans out there, this is the cream of the crop. The items and weapons are awesome, with some old favorites and a few new goodies. The boss fights are incredible! It is obvious that the game makers took a lot of time on this one to make sure to get everything perfect, and when you play you will see their attention to detail and patience in release will keep you playing and playing.I recommend this title for Wii players above most other games available today - regardless if you are a Zelda player of the past or not. Come see what the talk is all about..."
2,Well Written Review of Soros's Life,"The book was obviously well written and covered Soros's life in excellent detail. The only qualm I would have with the book was of how little it covered the financial aspects of his life. I feel the book mostly gave an account of his life and really did not go into much detail at all regarding his financial successes, but rather the philosophical and philanthropic aspects of his life."
1,Attention anyone under 65 years old....,"You will not enjoy this game unless you are a conniseur of old movies ... make that old ""MGM"" movies. Actually, this game is so boring I don't think anyone at all would have fun with it. Save your money or put it towards one of the other DVD movie games!"
2,Not bad,"I had a negative reaction in mind the first time I heard this album as I was expecting some warm, soulful gospel like the Staples Singers. I was a little taken aback by the style of this as I don't like a lot of 80's music much at all and also don't generally like this kind of thing either. Anyway, it's weird, but I gave this another try and it grows on you. Mavis is such a wonderful singer and the songs seem greater than the sum of their parts. I think it's actually really good music, though I lack understanding and familiarity with the style."
2,They stand on the shoulders of giants,"Wow. This is so such the ""Spirit of Jazz"" that I always loved I can't even find the words. True jazzbos taking the basic charts of melodies and do what they do best: reintrepret without reinventing, and still keep in there (albeit buried) the original soul of the composition. Standout track is Kasmir -- I play this for friends and they all sit up and take notice: ""Wow, who ARE these guys?"" Back in Black is my second favorite: they maintain the its-only-rock-and-roll-but-i-like-it playfulness of AC/DC. Oh, and they're absolutely demented. Liner notes say this was recorded at Frank Booth, so that should clue you into to the level of dementia. Further, in acknowleding (sp?) the original composers of their songs, they write in their liner notes ""We stand on the shoulders of giants."" Indeed."
1,strangely disappointing,"Perhaps I shouldn't have expected much from such an inexpensive item, but right off the bat it seemed off-kilter somehow: the screw tended to go at an angle into the cork, making it hard to withdraw and more likely to break. I haven't had extensive experience with corkscrews; still, this one seems unnecessarily, even dangerously, sharp to me. There's a little round collar on the top that's supposed to keep the screw from wiggling around and it pops out of its socket a lot. The idea's a good one - the easy-to-grip parts and the size and so forth - but it doesn't seem to work well in practice. I've been struggling along with this for almost a year, but I think I'll try one of the wine waiter corkscrews now."
1,christian spirituality,"It was not what I expected. The description doesn`t suggest that the content is christian biased. If you are looking after something esoteric or exploring new age mystisism, that` s not it. It is about the awakening of a christian inside you."
1,"Great tasting but does not ""cook"" properly","This soup tastes great and the price is not bad. But the contents of the soup do not fully ""cook"" when prepared as instructed (I have the same issue with a different Nile Spice soup). Even after letting the soup sit tightly covered for 10 minutes, about a third of the beans and 2/3 of the rice are still mostly hard (watch your teeth). I won't be ordering any Nile Spice soups in the future."
2,One of my all-time favorite movies,"I absolutely love this movie. I've seen it quite a few times and I still find it beautiful. I've cried during multiple scenes througout the film and even if I just catch the last few minutes I find myself crying. It's a wonderful tale.Now, to be a bit more specific, it's about four friends (surprise!) who grow up together during the 60's and come in and out of eachother's lives. There is the whole thing about the torment in the 60's and ""free spirits"" but it really upholds the traditional values, showing the faults in this type of adolescent thinking. There is also a oldworld-newworld conflict because Danilo, the main character, is an immigrant from Yugoslavia.There are so many levels of plot, but the emotion is what makes this film special. There are extreme moments of elation followed by bitter sadness and depression. It's real, it's beautiful, and it's a must see!"
1,Frustrated,"I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is difficult to get it started with the pull crank to start with and once you get it started it will not stay running. I think I am going to tear my rotator cuff if I keep using it. I will most definitely will not buy another poulan product again, I have a chainsaw that I have exactly the same problem. If anyone knows a solution please comment."
1,"Echelon, could be better.","This game could be great if they had spent as much time on the gameplay graphics as the cut scene graphics.Controls were mushy in all settings, graphics were choppy with a 64mb video card and a 1ghz pentium 4."
1,Not what I expected,"The lamp its bright and it works fine, just not what I expected, the light pattern its wide, not focus so much in one area, no matter what setting u used.."
1,wrong!!!,"this game is a rather fun game!! i loved the version for gameboy advanced, i played that one for hours. i saw this and i was like, ""hey! the hobbit for xbox!! this is awesome!! gotta be way better!!"", i ordered it and everything, make sure i chose the xbox one..... what did i get? the hobbit for PC.... how dissapointing...."
2,Not bad.,"My son is 5. He and his cousin each received these hats. His cousin is also 5. The quality is pretty ok. The only negative is the shape of the hat. The one pictured is basically perfect, while the two we received have a bit of an unusual fit. But, the kids seem to enjoy them, and most of the adults that have seen them made comments about them being pretty cool.We paid $19 for each hat. I would say $13 would be more appropriate."
2,GREAT GAME FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY!,"Love this game, as it is so much fun to play, but it also teaches children how to count & mulitply!!! I would say it is a super buy!!"
1,moldy oldie,I have purchased Yummy Chummies from Costco in the past and my pups love them. The bag that I rec'd from Amazon was moldy. Most of it covered with white and green fuzz. I didn't want the hassle of sending them back so I put them in the oven and baked them to kill the mold. That stunk my house up and made the treats hard as a rock. Two thumbs down and a waste of money.
2,timeless,This cd is probably's Johnny's best most creative work during his career.I loved this album when I only had a mono recored player with one speaker.All the songs here flow together as one.as one from start to finsh. Gilbert Campagna
1,This book is error-filled.,"This book is a great idea but filled with errors. Once you figure out what are the correct answers: ""The answers are arranged by tens, starting with numbers ending in one and ending with numbers ending in zero."",you discover lots of errors. For example, a correct answer is supposed to be #5,yet there are only 4 choices. Sloppy, sloppy. I do not recommend buying this book unless you want to research the questions that you do not know the answers to."
1,Not the extended edition; no thanks,First Disney puts out the pg-13 version of Pearl Harbor on Blu ray rather than the R rated version. Now the theatrical version of Chronicles rather than the extended edition; I'll wait for these versions before I buy these titles again.
1,Avoid this Printer--Software Not Available for Vista,Purchased this unit from HP Direct in July. Before buying it I confirmed in writing from HP that all functions would work with Vista. As of November the only thing that works in Vista properly is print--and that has problems. HP refuses to refund my money and is forcing me to buy another product--even though they told me it was fully functional in Vista before purchasing the unit. HP software has always been awful--now they don't even live up to their printed specifications. They have had enough time to rewrite all of their software for Vista---shame on HP. Avoid this unit all costs!! It doesn't work as advertised and HP won't stand behind it.
1,Shallow,This is a rip off. A quick sell to those who love Olympic gymnastics. Don't waste your money. Cursory. Cute. No depth. Absolutely no rhythmic or mixed doubles gymnastics -- probably because the US didn't fair well in those events. This is an embarrassment to the art form. Rhythmic displays the consumate feminine forms of movement and play (don't know if the men do this form). Mixed doubles demostrates the awesome dynamic between masculine & feminine. What a waste of money!
2,ammmmmmazzzzzzzinnnnnnng,"it just takes u away. u'd like to touch ""the sound""? there's an amazingly simple way. buy it and just listen to it!"
1,Jack Bauer In Print,"I read with great interest some of the reviews and descriptions of this series of books and truly looked forward to an entertaining novel in The Peacock Angel. What I received instead was a Jack Bauer-esque version of what the author imagines the world of espionage and intrigue to be. The clipped, macho, and totally cliche dialouge is distracting at best, and totally annoying at its worst. The characters are similarly shallow, cliche, and are cut from a fastfood, Jack Bauer 24-type mold, one which is designed for readers who have no imagination or appreciation for the subtlety of intelligence work. When placed next to say John LeCarre, Alan Furst, or Eric Ambler, this book shrinks to dust and blows away with the first breeze. In short, if you like cliche, shallow stories, by all means read away......"
2,Great!,"Being a huge gore fan i found this book great! I even discovered some gory movies that I didn't even know existed! The photos aren't that great, but they do help illustrate the book. Definetely worth the price!"
2,Watson has a great tenor voice and more,"I felt like owning some Watson, and this seemed like a good place to start, so I added it to my amazon.co.uk wish list, and fortunately someone purchased it for me. I was not disappointed: this is exactly what I wanted, a great roundup of what everyone is talking about - Watson's great tenor voice and myriad of pop voices.As well as classics such as Santa Lucia, The Pearl Fishers' Duet, Vesti la giubba, and La danza, Watson has a stab at semi-classical songs such as All Or Nothing and Immenso Sogno and my personal favorite, the Living Years.As some of the reviewers have said, every track is wonderful. Watson is, and always will be cool, and that is more than evident on this suave collection of songs with his wonderfully rich, varied voice. 5 stars."
2,Best Album in a long time,"Every song on this album is awesome. ""Miracle"" is my personal favorite. ""We Are"" is great as well. The whole album rocks. Best album bought this year."
2,Not a bad book,"This work is not about rehashing the passion of Christ. It is more about how even the more stable among us can get caught up in hero worship, how we turn on our heros and of course shadowy government manipulation in times of crisis."
2,Basic dictionary,"This is a good ""Basic"" dictionary, but should not be relied on. It doe snot have all the words in the English vocabulary of course, but in return has things you would need to carry a simple conversation. Aslpro.com is a much more comprehensive dictionary if you have access to the internet."
2,Great water sports watch,"Wearable, readable, reliable under water. Bought one for kayaking/sailing/swimming. Nice size for female with watch face easy to read quickly. Color and features caught eye of friends and family so bought another for family member. Both watches have been tested extensively swimming and are attractive and comfortable to wear."
2,BOOYAKA !!,Amazing!! Wonderfully inventive film showing new talent and great cinematography. Animation was fluid and precise although not as detailed as one would like. Overall a great movie/series...I'm just waiting for episodes 4-6 !! You won't be dissapointed.
1,Quick Connector Broke on Assembly,"My husband and I were trying to put this grow light system together, but within minutes one of the two-way plastic quick connectors broke when my husband gave it a few taps with his hand to get it into the upright legs. Everything else is metal, but the plastic connector is just too flimsy. I am disappointed, since I already have plants that need the grow light stand now. I cannot figure out any way on the Amazon website to get a replacement connector, since the grow light system is useless without it. Still, I don't want to pay the postage to send this back. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE AT AMAZON WILL PLEASE TELL ME HOW I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT CONNECTOR!!"
2,Works GREAT,It does what it's supposed to do! I bought it when I purchased the fryer. It woks great for saving the oil from the fryer.
1,"Not sure if it works, and the smell is absolutely nauseating.","Putting something with ozone (an industrial cleaner) directly on your face literally makes me sick. Wish there had been some sort of warning about the overwhelming smell of the stuff in the ad! Plus, you have to keep it in the fridge for some reason--which turns it into a solid white lump of grease. Fuggedaboutit!"
2,I like it,"I think Ashanti has alot of potential as an artist ,she s a good songwriter ,good singer with a powerful yet smooth voice .The problem is mainly represented by the beat of her songs and somewhat annoying hooks .This cd is way better than Chapter II.I enjoy listening to it,mainly becuz I love Ashanti s unique voice and lyrics.This is her best work. I cant complain ,I like it !"
1,"I regret the purchase, this model has a known issue","I wish I'd read more reviews before purchasing this set. The minimum volume on digital channels is loud and irritating, too loud to hold a conversation, to use the sleep mode, to read a book, or browse the web with the tv on in the background. (In loudness, it's equivalent to turning up the volume to 50% of the full range while playing a DVD.) This happens using an ordinary indoor rabbit-ears antenna, not through a cable box, satellite connection, surround-sound system, or any other device or amplifier. It applies to all programming on all digital channels, not just commercials. Sony Tech Support seems to be unaware of the problem, but I've found it mentioned in several consumer reviews."
1,Can anyone suggest 3rd party manual sources?,"Several of the previous reviewers have expressed dissatisfaction with the level of HP documentation. Can anyone suggest a potential source of user-friendly, easy to understand info (with lots of actual calculation examples - including required keystrokes) for a novice graphing calculator user? I have reviewed a number of 3rd-party guides for the HP 48g calculator, but they have been written (unfortunately) for more sophisticated users. Any ideas?"
1,duped be description--NOT MADE IN USA,"I purchased this item online with the belief that the description, including the words ""Made in USA"" were to be true. It is not. It is made in a country that currently trades with the U.S. and does not mind that high lead content and poor quality are a hallmark of their exports(never mind their workplace or human rights records!!!)I would send it back, but that would only throw good money after bad. Buyer beware, all descriptions are not the same and are not necessarily accurate...verify by phone first before you buy."
2,Refreshing,This is the kind of tea that will perk you up without a hint of caffein. It's really nice how it tingles on the tongue and you can keep refilling your cup with hot water without it losing the flavor since this is simply pure mint leaves.
2,Very Good Product,"I purchased this expandable phone system for my Dad a few years ago. The intercom feature was easy to use. My dad worn out the buttons of a couple of the handsets and I ordered replacements this year. Apparently, this an ongoing problem with the handsets. In other reviews, the manufacturer replaced the worn out handsets but I didn't take the time and purchased replacement handsets.The only thing I didn't like about this expandable system is that I couldn't transfer the phonebook to each handset so I spent a lot of time programming each handset so the custom rings for each call group worked."
1,Broken product,Not sure how the product is because it came broken. It was packed in the shipping box pretty terrible. Still waiting on my refund.
2,Expected it to be a little bigger but my son likes it,I thought there would be a little more to this but my son loves it so that's all that matters!
2,seems good,"As the mother of a 12 yo who plays ball, I can only say he uses it and seems to work fine. It is holding up just fine. What can I say? It goes in the hoop sometimes and at other times it doesn't."
1,All right,"I was intruiged by an artical in EW and so I read the book. The book was a huge dissapointment thought. There where some times that I found the book good, but it seemed to drag. The intial plot was good but I felt no empathy for Shadow. If you read this book and like it great, it's just that I didn't."
2,Wow! What An Excellent Book!,"This book is about a 14 year old girl who hates going to her family's passovers. While there, she goes to open the door for Elijah but actually opens a portal for herself and goes back in time to 1942 in Israel. This was the time of concentration camps and Hitler. This is a great book for students like myself to learn about what happened during these years. I would recommend this to any 5th to 10th grade teacher. That is why I gave this book 5 stars."
1,Burt Reynolds ruined this book for me,I have listened to the Spenser CDs with Joe Montegna and couldn't get past listening to chapter 4 with Burt Reynolds. His monotonous voice made much of the text incomprehendible. Read the book and skip the audio book for this one.
2,money saver,"A replacement filter is no longer available for my fridge, so I have been purchasing the 2.5 gallon jugs of spring water, which usually would last a week. My sister told me about this Pur dispenser. I have been using it for a month now and love it. In another month, it will pay for itself. I now use filtered water to make tea, gatorade, and coffee. My county water now taste like it came from a spring."
2,Home Theater Application,"I am using this product for my Home Theater Projector in my basement. Where I live, we have frequent power outages (especially in the Summer months with electricity demand). If I am using my Home Theater projector and the power goes out without the proper cooling of the bulb, I could lose 25% of the bulbs life. Bulbs for projectors run around $200 - $300 dollars. With the simple investment of this APC BE550R UPS unit, this problem is eliminated. I am probably going to get one more for my upstairs Home Theater system to stop the ""surges"" to my equipment when the power tries to come back on, also."
2,Excellent view,Very good film. I just love Anjelica Huston. She knows how to bring suspense to this movie. Definitely worth the time to watch.
2,Sick but funny,"A fun game in a twisted sorta way. The cheats add another fun factor to the game as you can fly over everyone and reak havoc. I havnt tried the expansion packs but from the reviews i prolly won't until their dirt cheap,,,,but for less than twenty bucks...its a good game for the money."
2,Lila is Here!,"With the coming of her first album, it looks like newcomer Lila McCann is here to stay. She is so real and so down to earth that anybody can identify with her music. Unlike other young talents (unnamed) Lila sings only about that which she can be passionate about and knows about herself. She is sixteen years old and you can tell that by her music. Good Job, Lila."
2,SoFarSoGood,I haven't had this long but it seems to be working. I haven't shocked myself which is a plus. And the cord does not get hot. What can you say?
1,Heavy-handed justice,"I'm a big fan of Tom Clancy's thrillers. Unfortunately, most of what makes them enjoyable to me is sadly lacking in this novel - the intricate global conflicts between various countries and political groups, the gobs of military technology, the inner workings and interactions of various government agencies.What we are given here instead is a tale of one man fighting his own private war on drugs. An interesting idea, but unlike Mr. Clancy's usual subject matter he demonstrates little knowledge of the domestic U.S. drug trade. The Drugs Are Bad message is hammered home in an unnecessarily preachy manner, and I found myself wishing that Clancy had been more succinct. Nancy Reagan managed to sum up the point of this novel in three words, and I'll echo them as my advice to potential readers: Just Say No."
1,Crashes my Kindle EVERY TIME!,"I would love to review Attwood's works completely, but the sample version crashes my new Kindle Fire every time I open it! Definitely don't want to purchase the full version if it causes me problems! Could a tech please fix/update???"
2,great book,"this book is really worth reading. I loved how she described all the characters, this book was very well written. i'd like to find more books by her soon."
1,Too wimpy,The Mr Bar-B-Q Oversized Dual Grill Brush wire brush is too wimpy to clean the grate. The wires need to be a little shorter and a lot stiffer.
1,Short Life,I bought this thing because I lost a memory mod to a power surge. It worked fine at first but now it has no battery life. Recently the power went out and my computer shut off immediately - like it was not on a backup at all. Of course the alarm was still screaming but so what - my computer was already shut off without any warning. I had this thing for two years but I will be going with a different brand next time.
1,Not The Best,"I bought this thick book (over 1000 pages) for $90AU and expected that by the time I finish reading it I would know Javascript from Start to Finish with no hinderences. I think this book would be very good for people that already know Javascript moderately because its reference is very extensice and good, but for teaching the language I don't think it qualifies as a good read. It is not layed out very well for newbies, and what about errors, even though there is a webpage at www.dannyg.com to download and read, it is very annoying to have to look at the error sheet to see if the example given doesn't have any errors to confuse the situation any more. For $90 I don't think it is the best Javascript book available on the market."
1,NOT THE BEST SECOND SINGLE,This song really shouldn't have been released as a single.It has very little appeal...the first one had more and it was enough to get her album launched.This song is one of those songs that make the album sales drop....Still go buy the album there are way way better songs....
2,One of the Greatest Games of All Time,"The end of Snake's long journey through the series ended with a ""bang."" In my opinion it had the second greatest story and game play of any of the MGS series (first being Peace Walker.)"
2,Excellant movie and seller,"I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie. The seller was extremely prompt and made the purchase feel as though I was buying from a friend. Way to do business!!"
1,A pointless film,"I got one thing to say about this movie, ""what dyke drama""It has no plot, no color, no intimacy, did I mention NO PLOT!!!!Its a poor excuse of movie making.""Shouldn't dyke movies by law at least have one cute girl?""and my last comment, waste of film, waste of time."
2,Letters of the Past,"I thoroughly enjoyed Sam's letters to Jennifer! I am an avid James Patterson Fan (especially of the Alex Cross Series) and to read something different like this from Mr. Patterson, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy as much. However I have come to realize that to be a GREAT Author, you need to show some diversity. Well Mr. Patterson certainly shows that in this book. Its well written, a quick read and very emotional! I loved it!The book is about Sam (the grandmother), Jennifer (the grand-daughter) and Brendan (the lost love). Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be. It showed Sam's unhappiness with her husband and her new found love in another man. Upon coping with her own life in the big city, and now coping with Sam and then Brendan, we see how strong Jennifer is and how much her love for her grandmother, will get her through."
2,The best of the best,"This is the best book that covers DSP. The topics are gone over conceptually, not mathematically, so one gets a solid grasp of what really goes on. I read it after taking a couple of DSP classes, but I wish I had it BEFORE. Lyons' book can be used as a self-study, theoretical reference for class/research, or as a practical reference. If you MUST understand what goes on in DSP this is a MUST buy!"
1,not much to be gained if a loyal fan,"This DVD (which I watched from Netflix) lived up to the many one star reviews. It had no real new content or interviews from anyone on the twilight set (directors or stars). The main ""sources"" of information were these british writters, Virginia Blackburn (who is writing a bio on Rob in November) and some people from the Barnes Theater and the Bad Mother's Handbook (which is an English film). The poriton on the Barnes theater is the only thing saving this from being a 1 star.Recommended instead for information:Youtube for interviews.Various fan webstites.Life Story- Robert Pattinson (magazine).Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazzar December 2009 (recent magazine interviews)Recommendation on this DVD: Avoid."
1,Disappointing,"I could only get through the first season. It felt like a rough draft for a bad Kids in the Hall episode. I saw the comparisons made in other reviews, and felt I had to chime in, this doesn't come close to their stuff, and (as some people that have maybe watched 3 hours combined of television and movies in their life) is the furthest from Monty Python as I could find. Yes, it's ""conceptual"", and if you love bad concepts (like New Coke) then this is the show for you. They try, they strain, and they [disappoint]. I gave a couple of chuckles, but as far as comedy goes, I laughed harder at Krsystof Kieslowski's ""White."""
2,my favorite childhood book,"When I was a little kid, this was my favorite book. Between myself and my brother, we read our first copy so much we wore it out and had to buy another one. If I ever have a son, this is the first book I'll buy him (and a daughter will probably like it too!)."
1,The Summer reading blues,"6 weeks ago I picked up this book, looking forward to another great Oprah pick. Boy, was I wrong. I compare this experience to having to read a Summer reading list selection during my high school honors English days. You know, the books you absolutely do not want to read but you know you have to or else you'll fail some sort of test. The test with this book was simply not giving up and making it to the end. The sentences were too wordy, the story was undeveloped and the characters were empty. The summer of 1999 will forever be remembered as the summer wasted on a bad book. Sorry Oprah, better luck next time."
1,This album is kind of crappy,"I used to love Limp Bizkit, Korn, Linkin Park, and those nu-metal rap-rock boybands when I started listening to rock music (3 years ago). Right now I'm 16 and my music taste has developed and grew. Right now I'm into alternative and softer rocks. I don't know, if I have to rate this cd when it came out i would give it a 4 stars, but right now 2 stars seemed a little too much..."
1,The title tells it all,"""On the way to the peak of normal"" eptly describe this album. It's the peak of Czukay's mediocore solo adventure. ""ode Perfume"" is the only memorable melody in this record, other works are full of studio technique, but without true aspiration of former Can. If you are Czukay fans, ignore my review. My review is to those who Know Czukay through his work in Early Can days. Krautrock Lovers Avoid this stuff and his later works."
2,Nothing better,There is nothing more convenient and effective for stretching as this deck. As someone who did not know anything about stretching I have learned everything I need to improve my flexibility and circulation. Whatever you need stretched you can find easily by flipping through the deck and the picture along with detailed instructions give you the perfect stretch every time. Comes in a great carrying box so you never lose the deck and a small manual about the importance of stretching which was very informative. Would recommend this to anyone even if they aren't that interested in stretching. Buy this deck you will never regret it.
2,Great Read,"Very good book, possibly one of my favorites. If you like great stories then you should get this book. And the fact that the Big Lebowski is loosely based on this is a huge plus."
2,Perfect Pitch,"I've read some of Alice Fulton's poems before. So what do I think of her Selected? In all honesty, Fulton makes reading seem worth doing, worth the effort. Her poetry has ideas as well as feelings and vice versa. She has perfect pitch and can be moving (sad) or moving (funny). I read A LOT of contemporary poetry, andafter having read her poems ""Some Cool"" and ""Split the Lark"", I can say there is no living poet I respect more. This is the best book of poems I've read in years, the kind that will pay you back with interest every time you return to it."
2,On target,"Just Trust Us is a slender book that packs a painful punch. Boyer has summarized the growing malaise of impotence and, worse, disinterest that is speading throughout the Canadian populace. ""Accountability"" is a word that our politicians spout with great regularity and yet examples of it can seldom be found in the halls of government. We, as Canadians, shrug and become increasingly cynical - we ignore scandal and by-pass the polling booths on our way to pay our taxes. The result, as Boyer states, is ""government of the government, by the government, for the government"".Just Trust Us is written in a casual, conversational style and the author refrains from tendacious diatribes; a rarity in any political tome. This is a ""must-read"" for Canadian citizens of all political persuasions."
2,Minimum rough opening dimensions,"The unit is 12.5"" high and 24"" wide, so your window must be at LEAST that big to fit this in.I couldn't find this information anywhere, so I called Uncle Joe's, who pointed me at Honeywell, 800 382 6693, and they answered my questions.I don't have the product yet but I ordered one based on people's positive comments."
1,Very poorly done,"This is a sad example of a movie. It had no rhythm, pace, storytelling or engaging acting/characters. None of the required elements to make a good movie even came close to sneaking into this one. The movie drags and drags through alternate haunted infirmary then police interview, back and forth incessantly. It flips back and forth so often that the entire story flow is destroyed. Further, there's no horror. Its at least 40 minutes into the movie before anything even remotely interesting happens, far too long. The acting is terrible. The interrogating cop, for example, should never set foot on a film set again. Avoid at all costs."
2,Fresh take on a rotten subject.,"Max Brooks has to be considered the ultimate modern-day writer when it comes to zombies. Between 'World War Z' and his 'Zombie Survival Guide' a zombie fan like myself is in flesh-eating heaven. 'Z' is a true masterpiece of the form though, and should be required reading for any horror/zombie fan. The research into geography, history, weapons and language are first-rate in this novel. Mr. Brooks has come up with so many new and terrifying scenarios that would undoubtedly play out in a zombie infestation that he leaves the reader feeling as if this were a work of non-fiction. A perfect piece of literature (zombie or otherwise)."
1,A MAXIS Fan's Nightmare,How worse can a game get?a 3d model tool kit that is made into a series of mini-games.Fancy but doesn't give any new exciting experience at all!Would want my money back.Don't buy. Save your good money for good worthy games.
1,"Online setup wizard doesn't work, so I can't configure","The URL that D-Link says you should go to in order to access the DWL-G700ap's configuration system doesn't load. Which means, you cannot configure the unit to make a unique name, set up security or have it work as an extendor to an existing system.I've tried loading the setup wizard from several ISPs, so that's not the problem. I've tried calling phone support, remaining on the phone in one instance for over 90 minutes, and haven't spoken to anyone. I've emailed their tech support several times, and have yet to receive a reply (not even an automated ""we got your email, expect a response""). Their online help site doesn't do anything other than point you at the same URL that doesn't work.So, I've spent $70 bucks on a thing I can't use. I'll never use D-Link products again."
2,Oscar in Paris,Excellent ensemble playing; very intuitive and balanced. A must for any serious jazz collection.
2,The American Dream,"Unlike other economic books Barbara Ehrenreich tells us the truth behind the American Dream through her book ""Nickel and Dimed: On (not) getting by in America. Taking on odd, minimum wage jobs she shows us how difficult it is for one to survive in America on a minimum waged salary. She tell us the truth that no one seems to have the guts to tell us. This book is highly recommended to those who want to inform themselves on how our economy really functions."
2,The Greatest RPG of All Time,"Chrono Trigger was the first RPG that I really got into...now of course I play Chrono Cross and FFVII and I've played RPGs before Chrono Trigger, but just the pitiful attempts of a little girl. Chrono Trigger had a great story line, and it was fun to play through. Some RPGs get really tedious after the first five discs (or at least it seems like it) but I played Chrono Trigger through at least five times, and played parts of it dozens of times. It is the best RPG I don't think there will ever be one as great if I live to be 1000. Seriously."
1,"Worst Steven King book, avoid!","I am actually a fan of Steven King, but for a time he just really seemed to run out of good ideas and was trying to get a bit too clever. This travesty is the result. He tries to do a ""stream of consciousness"" type of book, trying to take us into this woman's mind, and what she is thinking about and it just doesn't work, it's terribly boring and annoying. This is one of the few books I really had to strain to finish, as it was so unpleasant to read. Not sure why I did bother to finish it, other than just determination to not leave a book unread, but the ending certainly didn't leave me feeling any more satisfied than the rest of the book."
2,getting luckey,"the best chipmunk video every amazing animation ive loved this movie since i was 6 its an all star classic first realesed in 1987 (the tv show Alvin and the chipmunks started in 1981 The Alvin show started in the 1950s)and remastered in 1998 with a cd a 2 sequels Alvin and the Chipmunks meet frankenstien,1999 and Alvin and the chipmunks meet the wolfman,2000. my personal favorite characters are Alvin the chipette girl Brittany although they both are alittle braty. any waty this movie has agreat plot great sons like oldie getting lucky and woolie boolie and my favorites Girls of rockin roll and Diamond dolls and were off to see the world . both chipmunks and chippetes rule."
2,Ponyo DVD/Bluray Combo,"AWESOME!!!My 3 yr old twins (boy/girl) love the colors and scenery of the movie. The story of love between two people beyond anything physical and without any selfish motives, transcends all age groups and was refreshing to see! Loved it from beginning to end!Service was great too. We didn't expect it as soon as it came but they got it to us in less than a week!"
2,Pleased,"Very pleased with this product. The size, color and make of the pants is just what we were looking for. The price was very resonable. Will buy additional pairs."
2,"Is it ""Pacific Postcolonial"" or ""Postmodern,"" hard to say..",some spectral music and mongrel melodies do come in from across the Pacific from Honolulu to Santa Cruz to Taipei back to the grave of Henry Opukaha'ia in Cornwal and on Hilo where he lay ensconsed in the spirit of the lord along with the ghost of say Walter Benjamin and Saint Paul of the spectral resurrected aesthetics then and now...
1,What's With The Pig? I Stopped Reading When It Took Over.,I tried hard to get into this book and even started reading itagain from q the beginning to try to make sense of it. Too confusingand too wordy and it was a strain attempting to get into it so I stopped. I'm going to stop purchasing Oprah's book selections as they are all beginning to be about the same subject matter and oppressions suffered by the characters.
1,Nothing speacial about this,This should be free. The plot the movie itself is NOT special. The content is NOT worth the price. Please consider this as a free movie.
1,Horrible,"Nothing like teaching kids as early as possible that breastfeeding is ""barbaric"" and ""cannibalism"". I am truly disgusted that children are reading this nonsense. Shame on you, Ms. Levine!"
2,Great pictures and luxurious descriptions,This is a great book to take you away and get you dreaming about that next spa trip!
2,Tested: Two trips. 7 walks. Excellent and fun,"My wife and I have used this book to select and guide 7 walks for two trips we have taken and highly recommend it as a guide to day trip walking, which is its focus.If you want to do continuous multi-day walks, then this is not your book. However the books that focus on multi-day trips can be overwhelming and difficult to use for day hikes. I own one of them also and so speak from experience.For day hikes the great strengths of this book are: 1. Its selectivity. The walks are great choices. Magnificent ways to experience the country. 2. The dry humor and pleasant style, something one doesn't expect to find in this form.One word of caution, however, allow some time to get a little lost, particularly if you don't have the maps he recommends, which we didn't. However, we never failed to find our way or complete the walk, so it does work and is great fun."
2,"True ""Revenge of the Nerds""","Let's face it, Hollywood movies usually get real people's lives all wrong. Doctors make instant diagnoses, cops can hit a dime at a hundred yards, cops never sit at a desk filling out paperwork, and nerds are pretty people who happen to wear glasses.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a strange movie, but the people in it are real nerds, all the folks you knew who had serious trouble relating to others - and didn't suddenly become party animals after smoking a joint.If you want to see a pretty funny comedy with characters who seem like real people, albeit very eccentric ones, check this one out."
1,"Pirated edition, avoid!","Don't buy product from pirates. These theives don't deserve your business.Get the *real* Max Fleischer classic Popeye cartoons here:Popeye the Sailor: 1933-1938, Vol. 1and here:Popeye the Sailor: 1938-1940, Vol. 2and here:Popeye the Sailor: 1941-1943, Vol. 3.Now, if they'd only do similarly for Fleischer's Betty Boops!!!"
2,Very pleased,The process was very quick and easy. My book arrived quicker than I expected and was in excellent condition.
1,Not very good material its made of,"I had this ball for quite a while, it seems smaller then the one of same size I already had before, but was old and I needed to replace it.. it smelled pretty bad, now it is better, but I don't think it is good quality material, very smelly and sticky, I don't use it too much because I don't like it. I am gonna replace it in future with some good brand name..."
2,Excellent edition of the book,"This is an excellent edition of the book, it even includes a small timeline biography of Alexandre Dumas which was very insightful. Overall no complaints with this product at all."
2,We watch this movie once a year,I hope my kids will learn these lessons: Don't let anybody tell you you can't do something. Sometimes there's no substitute for good old stubbornness.
1,Wireless,"I have been looking or wireless listeners for my father for a while now. So I found these at a great price, but all that shines is not gold. Horrible, I had to return them. I guess that when it comes to wireless technology one has to spend a bit more money. Like for the Sony ones..."
1,a total waste,Savini is wasted. The Living Dead concept is wasted. It's an incoherent mess. The less said about it the better.
2,WOW! So glad I waited,"We bought this for our kids for XMAS and WOW, they love it and so do I. You would never convince them that they are learning while playing, but that's ok too. My kids absolutely love it, and when one of them is playing the other is hanging close by waiting for their turn. The only down side is, I may just have to get another! Hope Leapfrog sticks with this for a while and offers lots of different cartridges..."
1,Awesomely lacking,"as stated before, NOT BLUETOOTH. this is annoying. it comes with the option to run with batteries or with a rechargeable pack. and a rather long puny charge cable. I figured most of that was for pure speculation, as the chargepack lasts something of 30 mins or so. I bought two of these because i liked the design, only one can be rated 3 stars because the battery lasts about an hour or so. save yourself effort, time and hassle and don't buy these. They have the potential for greatness, but are found lacking."
2,"If you welcome Spring, you'll welcome this CD!","I bought this CD last Spring and enjoyed it and then Summer came and I put it away...... yesterday I felt ready for Spring and pulled out this CD and remembered how great it was. I listened to it over and over...It will become part of my Spring anticipation ritual. The Cd is a combination of Lui's original poetry and music as well as a few covers including Cheryl Wheelers ""His Hometowm"" and a beautiful version of Patty Griffins ""Making Pies"" and the popular song ""Red Red Robin"".It is the perfect seasonal CD for awaiting and welcoming Spring."
2,Makes an unplesent job better,After using various Pooper Scoopers. I found this one works best. It is just a well made rake with the spacing just right for the job. I just carry a throw away plastic bag with me and carefully dump the Poop in the bag and throw thewhole mess away.
2,"Beautiful, Bountiful Thanksgiving",What a surprise for my family to see the beautiful table laid out for thanksgiving. The Lennox Napkins and Table clothe were a perfect compliment to my China and fit the new table like a dream. AND they cleaned up nicely too! I love these table linens and will deffinetly purchase more in the future.
2,Xmod does what it is supposed to do.,Does a fine job of adding another layer of quality to digital recordings. Enhances both the highs and lows.A bit expensive and definitly not portable. It has to be powered by a USB port.
2,Chrysanthemum,"This is a great book that teaches children that who they are is just fine, no matter what other people say. In this book, the character loves her unique name until children at school make fun of it, after which she decides that maybe it's not such a great name after all. Eventually, she realizes that uniqueness isn't a bad trait, after all."
1,Idiosyncratic opinions of the author.,This book is very outdated. I would recommend Andrew Skurka’s “The ultimate hiker’s gear guide” for a look at contemporary hiking/backpacking practices.
2,Timeline-A Medeval Jurassic Park,"All of the elements of Jurassic Park are here in Timeline. Even the theme park idea. I enjoyed Timeline, however a few elements of the plot grew tiresome. The three characters involved were constantly being separated, when their union was essential. This is definitely a page turner, however. I admire the research that Crichton puts into his fiction."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Be aware that Discs 1 and 4 DID NOT operate on my Sony Blu Ray. Disc 4 DID NOT operate on my Sharp Blu Ray. I returned this product to Amazon. I guess quality control is not a high priority at Amazon. I am a Twilight Zone fan and was extremely disappointed. The quality of the discs that worked was excellent, it was like I was watching the epidsodes when they first aired. I kind of wished that they had included some of the commercials from back in the day. Due to the excellent quality of the discs I was able to watch is the only reason I gave it two stars. Now I am a hesitant to purchase Season 2 when it is released."
2,"Sex , food and exitement.","After 5 minutes, you ask yourself: ""What am I reading"". After you have read the whole book, you tell your best friend to read the book. It simply captures you, and you can't let go of it. Read the book, then see the movie."
1,Wrong Item!,"The item I received was not the one depicted in the image. Furthermore, the screws and nuts must have been for a different frame. I had to purchase an additional 20 washers to make them work with the frame that I received. The assembly was not too difficult after I figured out that it was not my stupidity but the manufacturer's mistake that caused the problem. The instructions were also for a different frame."
2,Excellent..,This product is wonderful and I have been using it for years..just no longer can find it in stores..usually pay less than $5.00 for this amount. You price is one of the worst gouges I have had in my 70 years..but I got the tea...J.Earl
2,"Not Bad, But.....","This was another anime set that left me a little flat. It's not a bad set., but I would have liked to have known that this was the second set of a more than one set series on this anime. I think I would have liked it more if I had gotten the first set first. Still it wasn't bad."
2,A great book for a parent to read to a child.,Wonderful drawings accompany a story of how a small hare and his dad show how much love they have for each other. Easily one of the best kid's books I've seen
1,Sheldon's worse,"First of all the book is about the political world, I think there is enough about poltics on tv without this book, secondly the characters aren't likable, expect for Dana. Lesley was okay at at first then i stopped feeling sorry for her when her revenge led to treating other badly, plus the plot isn't good. The only good thing was Dana in Sarajevo even though I didn't see how that fit in the main plot. At least Sidney SHeldon researched the subject well as he usually those but this novel was really terrible."
1,No,"This album is less signifigant than a hair on my left nut. Am I the only one that notices that 50 doesn't even try? It seems like all his verses are all one word. And I'm no fan of anyone he disses, they suck too. Except Nas, Nas is 50 times the rapper 50 could ever be. But do you fools realize that there is good music that Isn't played on the radio. Geezus. Gangsta rap sucks, these fools aint gangstas. Get with the underground."
2,My Least Favorite...but Still a Good Read,"This book was as well-written as the rest, but I was disappointed to find that the Scarlet Pimpernel/Sir Percy is only really featured in the last ten pages of the book. While Josette was interesting enough...I wanted more of the hero for whom the book was named."
1,One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!,"Suffice it to say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Not an ounce of wit; the pacing was like slogging through wallpaper paste in snowshoes. The movie was apparently cut down to 77 minutes from the original 90. It should have been cut to 77 seconds...and it still would have been boring! At least at $1.99, which is what I paid for it at GoHastings, it wasn't overpriced! Extremely disappointing, since I'd always heard this was a forgotten classic. It SHOULD be forgotten! You're better off with another Paramount ""all-star"" film from the same year of 1933, INTERNATIONAL HOUSE. Far funnier!"
1,Absolutely Horrible!!!,"I have never written a review for a book or a DVD before, but I feel compelled to do so now. This is absolutely the worst DVD I have ever purchased! I actually thought it was a joke at first. After reviewing the first 15 minutes, I actually took it out of the DVD player and resisted the urge to throw it in the garbage. The instructor, Alan Harris, is rhythmically-challenged and unbearably obnoxious (if you can believe it, he comes right up to the camera and yells). He was off beat so many times I stopped counting. The choreography is boring and uninspiring. The production quality is laughable and clearly the work of amateurs. I just tried calling the production company, M2K, to complain. Now that I've opened the DVD I can't return it, so I'm going to let everyone know how horrible this DVD is."
1,What the ... where they thinking?,"I was hoping for a game that ADDS to the movie, instead I GOT the movie, full with behind the scenes footage! Argg, what a waste of money. It repeats the ENTIRE movie. There is so much time wasted on the movie clips and 1/1000th of that is actual game play. Why make a game at all? There could have been so much more to it, if they took the time."
1,"okay for the money, but...","You have to pay close attention to the dials (a magnifying glass would help) because you have to have all 3 lined up correctly in order to toast something. With most of these things, you kind of get the hang of the ritual after a week or so, but this thing is a little counter-intuitive, so it takes a while longer."
2,Nothing like a saga,"This is a reread for me. I first read it when it was released in the 80's. I loved the whole concept and used to eagerly await each book of the McGregors to be released. I have subsequently bought them again for my Kindle. The story, like all Ms Roberts, is well told and gets you acquainted with old friends. This is a series of books I would thoroughly recommend."
2,Murder With Peacocks,This is my first Meg Mystery by Donna Andrews. I am definitely going to buy more of her books. It was not only a mystery but a funny and slightly romatic book. Another book that was hard to put down.
1,Rip OFF,"why dont i hear from anyones review that her hit single ""make her feel good"" samples the beat from Eric B.& Rakim's My Melody. you know the song ""check check check check out my melody"" only one review i read actually knew that it sampled Eric B. and Rakim's single. you know what i bet you everyone on the rocafella roster but Teairra Marí knew what that beat came from. if i was to ask her where it came from shed probably tell me ""sum band from the 80s"" DONT SAMPLE A SONG THAT YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE FROM. Teairra Marí GO TO HELL YOU ANNOYING bizatch! Most of you didnt even know that either. SAME ON YOU, YOU SAY YOU LIKE HIP HOP MEANWHILE YOU DIDN KNOW THAT? WHERES THE RESPECT?"
1,major design flaw,used for only 1 1/2 weeks and the screw that holds the blade and basket in place got stuck. It took plyers just to loosen. The part that the screw sits on top of is plastic and the basket screwed itself onto the plastic and got stuck in place and tore a groove in the plastic making in impossible to remove.
1,What Happened?,"After getting excited about the new Dummies' release, my happy excitement soon turned to blah sadness! This album is the worst I have heard in years! This ""experiment"" did not work! It is filled with trip hop lame beats and rambling meaningless lyrics. At the end of the 12th song, this cd had me crying: Why, oh Why!? .......another 15 bucks down the drain."
1,secret ingridients?,The amount of zinc oxide directly relates to the products effectiveness. 5% is minimum....This product does NOT tell you how much is in it......Won't order it again.
1,Worst Product EVER,"This product is horrible. I followed the instructions carefully and had freshly painted, clean, dry walls. The product didn't stick for more than 5 minutes. It's difficult to put on and it doesn't work. I am very disappointed since I picked paint colors for my son's room based on this border and now it doesn't work so I need to buy another one which will not match."
1,Didn't work,"Got it hooked up. the display would light up for a couple seconds after I punched in the ""reset"" button. Then it would just go away. Over and over. The thing didn't work. The seller promptly let me return it."
1,This is not what one would expect,"As one who watched when Prairie Home Companion was broadcast by PBS and listened on the radio for the rest of the years I was not impressed by this DVD. I listen to Prairie Home Companion because it is uplifting and entertaining. This movie is slow and depressing and the only thing I found of value was the music tracks on the bonus menus. I received more enjoyment from the 30 year anniversary DVD. This movie did not reflect the values and talents of the radio broadcast. However, it may be a good indication of what is coming to the show."
2,The First Edition of this book is now out of print,"The first edition of this book is now out of print. To order the NEW Second Edition of ""How To Master the Sport of Darts"" from Amazon you must click on ""Perfect Paperback"" in the ""Also Available in"" box on the amazon.com page for the first edition. The Second Edition is subtitled ""Complete and comprehensive instruction in all aspects of Soft Tip, Steel Tip, and American-Style Darts, with additional commentary and advice from legendary Masters of the Sport"". It is, indeed, all that and more."
1,No point in this movie at all,"Ok, so I thought that I would give this a try because everyone said that it is a great movie, well, I sure didnt think so. So it took like 30 min. until the movie started to take off and actually start to seem like it could be a good movie but when it ended I was so upset that I sat through the whole thing. This movie made no sense and it ended just like that, not explaining anything. I feel as though this movie was rushed and there was really no point in making this movie at all. I am so upset about this movie and I feel stupid for watching it. All it seemed to be about was sex and a writer and that is it. Really really bad movie."
2,BEST EVER!!,"If you like westerns? This is the ultimate. With awesome cinematography. YOU HAVE TO SEE AND GET IN WIDESCREEN!! A story about friendship, revenge, and family. It is my all time favorite western..with Tombstone, Unforgiven and, Shane close behind! Pay atention to the last words of the movie..spoken by Kevin Costner.... ""We'll be back!"" Ive been waiting for a sequal ever since!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!"
1,The beleiver,"I knew people like this,back in the day,We called them BANANA SKINS/ POSERS was another term! they were confused warped frustated little rich a## brats, buy it only for the fight scenes."
2,Good..but not for beginners,"This book is good for seasoned MFC programmers, but it isn't appropiate for beginners. There are good examples, really good to solve some real world situations, but if you want to learn MFC, this is not the book. I'm not dissapointed but neither satisfied."
1,Neverending Celtiic Knot Sterling Silver Ring,"This ring is one of three I bought at the same time...the other two fit perfectly, and I wear them daily. This one just doesn't fit correctly. It says it's the right size, but it is either mis-marked or this company's size 7 is different from the standard size. Disappointed in the ring."
1,The Weight Loss Cure They Don't Want You to Know About,"This book is a scam. Now if you watch the infomercials Trudeau is onto writing books about making it rich. Guess he knows what the world wants to know, how to be thin and how to be rich! He plays us right into his greedy little hand and feeds us the biggest bunch of BS! Don't waste your money. I read the first few chapters. Nothing made sense at all. Rambling on in verbage to hide his ignorance. I'm sure he is laughing his way to the bank!"
2,Technics RPDJ-1200a,"I've been using these headphones in a professional nightclub setting for 4 years, and I'm just buying my second pair now. What I'm trying to say is that these things are rugged, way more than many competitors which are known to religiously break at the hinges. I love one-ear (as opposed to over-ear) cans, and they're loud enough to keep me connected in most settings. The only ""malfunction"" I've found is that the padding came off one of the ear cups, but that's bound to happen after many years of abuse.I've used them in non-DJing applications, too, and they're comfortable on the head for extended periods of time."
2,Very Early Australia,"Very good read. Very informative, great detail, a little hard going at times, perhaps because of the great detail. However I've currently only read 20% of the book"
2,Definately Worth getting!!!,"The show was great, and I especially enjoyed the cast from San Francisco that I saw. The original Broadway cast sounds great too. It was definately a good buy!"
1,I can't recommend this one,"Had it for about 5 days before the end. The lamp produces enough heat to make the clear plastic housing become soft and 'melt'. When cooler the plastic would be 'hard again' into a distorted form. Any sort of cloth or cover over the lamp's plastic housing will/would greatly increase the heat (to the 'softening melting point.) If this lamp was laid down on a work bench rag or cloth and left on 'face down'...you would singe the cloth and soften even faster the clear housing.Mine distorted enough to stick to the bulb and bulb was removed. Luckily, I has there to notice the problem. If buying or have one, at least remove the 13 watt bulb and hope a 9 watt fluorescent would be cooler. Monitor the heat feel of the lamp. Clear plastic housing should of been of much higher grade."
2,excellent product,"The product came exactly as specified, the design of the product makes it extremely easy to carry around with you...it is light weight, but also durable with a plastic cover that closes over the scale. It is pretty much always accurate, but may not register under .3 g, anything above that registers almost immediately making the product very accurate. I would definitely recommend this to other people.po"
2,Wonderful book,"Johnny Cash: The Man Comes Around is an inspirational story of trial and triumph. Even if you're not a Cash fan and don't know anything about the man, this book will interest you. What a remarkable man with an incredible story and life. This was one of those books I didn't want to put down until I was finished. It is a reminder of the appreciation we should all have for life and faith. This book is an insightful look at an American legend. Enjoy this book and get to know the Man in Black."
2,Great fun for all ages,I love the movie so I decided to pick up the book & like most books it is WAY better! It really keeps even the adults on the edge of their seats. Sooo much fun highly recommended.
1,Pornographic and bad acting,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it once and I don't care about seeing it again. This movie is a little pornographic, to warn you. The acting was also terrible -- DeFoe tries to sound erotic when he was with Madonna but he sounds like he's acting (poorly) through the sex scenes. Madonna looks like she was about to laugh when she poured hot wax on the poor guy. The only thing I learned about from this movie is the S&M stuff....the other scenes I would just put in the trash because it was so bad. I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all."
2,say YES to THE STONES,THE STONES WERE A GREAT BAND AND ALMOST AS GOOS AS THE BEATLES.ALL THEIR ALBUMS INCLUDING THIS ONE ARE CLASSICS.IGNORE THE ONE STAR REVIEWS AND BUY THIS ONE.
2,great teapot,"The pot is a pleasure to use. It's not too big nor too small. The design is simple and classy. The spout is well designed, the water can pour without dripping. Nor does it feel too heavy. The price is VERY reasonable for a cast iron pot. Goldilocks would be happy, it's just right.There was no noticeable flaw with my tea basket. When I first started using the pot, there was a little rust spot forming on the pot lip. So I seasoned the pot and lid - rubbing a fine coat of cooking oil on the outer cast surface and placing the pot in a cold oven and then setting it to 250F for one hour. I enjoyed coddling my little pot like that. The outer surface now has a little extra sheen and it stopped rust spots formation."
2,Sweet movie,'nuf said.Now reading other people's reviews begs the questions...why are they so long? Are they auditioning for something? EVERYONE's a movie critic.
1,This DVD [is bad]!,"I would have to say that the only good moment of this DVD is the Trish Stratus- Vince Mcmahon angle, and that is why I gave it two stars instead of one.Where's The Rock? Where's Triple H? Where's The Hardy Boyz?This DVD [..is bad..]!"
2,Lee of Perth,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is the first one of Tess Gerritsen's books that I have read and I am now onto the second one which I am enjoying.
1,Blow Back Problems,This Is a cool gun BUT...Has NO acuracy and the instruction manual is really hard to read i like it as a side arm but only in tight situations.
2,one night with the king,One Night With the KingA visually lovely movie.However a bit slow for my liking.The story is pretty biblically correct.
2,Hard Evidence,"I really enjoy the writings of John Lescroart! This was another fine piece of work!!!!! Well worth the read and, as usual, I was sad to reach the end....."
2,nursing pillow,"I have both the boppy and my brest friend. I found my brest friend more practical(especially after having a C-section) than the Boppy. It was difficult to position my baby in Boppy compared with my brestfriend. My brestfriend you can strap on which helps save your back. However, my baby is 7 weeks old and I am still brestfeeding and I don't use either one of the pillows. Eventually you learn to brestfeed without either one of them."
2,"Good bracket, go with a longer one for 50 inch TV's","Was disappointed with this bracket when I first looked at it, but after hanging it I am completely pleased with it.I have hung several friends TV's and this bracket has been the nicest of all of them, despite being the least expensive. The thin design allows the TV to lie closer to the wall then most brackets. The dowels in the pivot mechanism allows effortless positioning, that retains its position without restraint.The only downfall of this bracket is that if you are using it on a 50 inch TV, go with the model with that supports 60 inch displays (ST660)so that you can mount the TV to three studs vs two."
1,Would rate it lower than 1 if I could.,"WORST... SOFTWARE... EVER! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME LIKE MYSELF AND SO MANY OTHER POOR SOULS DID! Read the reviews, cnet also. Go to the Pinnacle Support User Forum Site (pinnaclesys dot com) and read the countless people who can't get it to work.This software just doesn't work, end of story. You will be more upset about your time wasted than your money, buy anything but this. Render error, render error, render error... you will have nightmares about crashes and render errors, no wait, they are real. The only person who should buy this is the smart lawyer who is going to start the class action lawsuit against Pinnacle for selling us something that is not even beta quality, it is pure crapware, try to make anything longer than 20 minutes with transitions and it does not work, period."
1,There are much better options in headphones,"I seem to be on a headphone quest, owning at least nine of them by now and I bought this one strictly on impulse not realizing I think these headphones are meant for a younger person ( maybe teen ot pre-teen) who may not be as concerned with the sound quality as they are with the look. The phones do look cool but aside from that they are cheaply made and the sound quality is poor. The bass is easily distorted and experimenting with my Zen Vision's equalizer settings didn't help. I returned these phones for a refund and would not recommend them for critical listening.I am definetly not an expert in sound, or anything else for that matter but these headphones definetly look better then they sound. I hope this helps in making your purchase."
2,Historical fiction and a great read.,Another great historical fiction book which I recommend to anyone who is interested in reading about the Tudors. Remember the series on TV. The books are always better.
2,Ten secrets for mind/body healing from Kabbalah mysticism,"Ten secrets for mind/body healing from Kabbalah mysticism are revealed in this blend of ancient wisdom and modern psychology. Hidden Faces of the Soul uses the Kabbalah teachings to probe compassion, dominion, faith and other 'hidden faces' of the soul, and makes for an excellent guide for any probing personal spiritual goals."
2,intraoral pics,"It's really good. I'm a little confused though on how to use it since I used another friend's camera before and he had everything set up w AV n just changes the numbers. I'm kinda ignorant on setting up cameras but the pics I took using AV w ettl mode on flash settings were good but I get a lot of black pics. Again, it's me not reading the catalogue"
1,WARNING My filter split and flooded my house.,The bottom of my RC-EZ-4 split while I was on vacation and flooded my house.
1,"Too Much, Too Preachy!!!","There are not enough words in the world for me to describe how much I disliked this book. The author has enough ""issues"" for about 10 books crammed into 1. None of the characters or situations were close to being believable. All the characters were extremely selfish, I never cared what happened to any of them. Fair or not, the only reason I kept reading it was because of the McMillan name. I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did. Very disapointing."
2,Edward friend of Thomas the Tank Engine,I received the toy in a very few days after ordering. I ordered the train engine for a Christmas gift for my 2 year old grandson to go with his other Thomas pieces.
1,Phony uplift,"What a boring, obvious movie! Yes, sensuality is good, repression is bad, free spirits are better than uptight clergymen, and the marginalized are always right. I'm sure the makers of this film live by those principals on a daily basis. At least they sure love espousing them. ZZZZZZZZ."
1,don't buy these broken used guitars,"I tried twice with this product. first time, the neck was warped so much that it couldn't be tuned. I requested an exchange for another one. The second time the neck is messed up, and it looks like there was a shoddy attempt to refurbish it and pawn it off on me as new. Even worse, when I've wasted my time on this thing and I send it back in for a refund they charge me a restocking fee."
2,sweet and simple pleasure,"This tea is such a treat (especially as a crisp minty companion to chocolate). Offers the taste of premium tea without the extra price. Thank you, Celestial Seasonings; I owe you this 5-star review."
2,One of Ms Brown's best!!,"I just bought this paperback at a local Kroger store. I didn't even realize that it has been in publication since 1999. I was hooked from the beginning.. and didn't want to stop reading it. I kept thinking.. ""OK, I will read to the end of this chapter and then put it down"". WRONG.. the author teases you to the next one. I was reluctant to set it aside to do those necessary household things or even sleep. What a movie this could be. I'm already casting it in my mind."
2,Deal With It,"why are you all complaining about these mixes? frankly, I don't think anything better could have been done. I like the mixes a lot, especially the last one. great song, good mixes, awesome cover picture!"
2,"The Nitty Gritty's Sgt. Pepper "" Once upon a concept""","This album was the last concept album the band recorded with William McEuen playing a major role in its musical production. Liberty Records heavily promoted this album and distributed it to the radio stations with an interview album and a single sampler. Advertisements appeared in major music-oriented magazines and it received very good reviews from the music critics. Commercially, the album failed to live up to the label's expectations and artistically marked the end the band's direction into the ""uncharted"" (pun -intended) waters of AOR country rock. Unjustifiably, this album has never received its due for its musical content or concept. It was the last of the NGDB Liberty albums to be re-released by BGO. This is a landmark album that should be in every Dirt Head's collection. (end of sermon...you can return to your lives, citizens)"
2,Interesting Read,Written in Red Ink is definitely a page turner. It kept me in anticipation; wondering what would make a mother loathe her child so (is'nt a mothers love to be unconditional). Well if you read the book you will find out exactly what the deal is. Kieja Shapodee has created a very interesting and smartly developed novel. I'm glad to know that there is a sequel in the works about the Bennett's. Great book; get it-you won't be disappointed.
2,Surprisingly Good,"This is a very good movie worth rewatching. Its probably one of the best movies I've seen from 2005. The acting is nearly flawless, and the story is engaging. I don't even listen to Johnny Cash before but my head was bouncing on almost every musical scene. Some of the scenes are quite intense and very realistic."
1,Slightly disappointed,"I've been looking forward to seeing this for several months. I've enjoyed Silverman's style & edge in the past.Alas, this film was only occasionally funny. There were some terrific one-liners...but it was long & drawn out, and painfully slow at times. I agree with Roger Ebert - watching this movie makes me want to see Sarah Silverman in something else.Watching the movie was like watching a son or daughter perform at the school play - you really wanted her to do well, despite screwing up all the lines.The only real ""edge"" in this one were some toilet and pen*s jokes - otherwise, she was playing it safe. The singing was a bit dull, and the skits came off as something they threw in to make it a ""real movie"" instead of just a stand up routine. But 75% of the movie was standup, and it wasn't really her best stuff.Maybe she's best in smaller doses."
2,Not given enough credit,"This C.D. is good. It may be different from their other 3 C.D.'s. (yes three), but I respect their change. I don't think anyone is giving them enough credit. I hope this C.D. will grow on people as it has on me."
2,Reasonably impressed,"As a fan of the series, I thought I'd go ahead and check out the book. Artistically it is well done, though I'd say some of the scenes are very confusing visually. There is just so much detail there's just too much noise in some of the scenes. That, and it seemed to read ""too quick"". I don't know, it just seemed like I breezed through it very quickly. Once again, well done with just a few small complaints. Thumbs up!"
1,"Worked for 2 weeks, then...","Had the player for 2 weeks and was great, but then the left audio decided to stop working. I thought it was the headphones, and tried another pair and had the same problem, but then it worked again. I see that other reviewers have had the same issue.***UPDATE***I am updating this review because I found out that the head phones that I owned stopped working (on the left side!). I tried them in my laptop and the left audio would not work there either. I used other earphones, earbuds - and they work fine. So, can't say that it is the Sansa's fault.It won't let me change the star rating. I would give it a 4 out of 5."
2,"Fun, Easy Game","I had this game growing up and have played it with my children as well. My game from childhood is still in fine shape and was used regularly, but we took care of it and didn't fight over it or drop it. I can see how this game may break if misused a little. Anyway--it's a fun game and easy for little ones to pick up, but as other reviewers have said once you are well versed then it boils down to who goes first. I recommend for age 4 to 8 or 10."
2,It's The Orb,You know how an Orb album is like in that you don't know how it's going to be but somehow you know it'll be weird . Basically this doesn't disappoint and is one for the major Orb fan while it should please newcomers .Enjoy
1,Hair pulled out,"My 4 yr old received this toy from Santa and was playing with it on Christmas morning when we heard, ""Help me, Help me!! Owwie, Owwie, Stop, stop!!"" Her waist length hair became entangled in the wheels/feet of the dog, and because Daisy is sound activated, her cries for help only made the wheels turn more. I frantically turned it off but by then a decent sized chunk of hair had already been pulled out."
2,Good for intex pools,I have a 24' intex pool. The bottom is not that smooth in some areas. This product does a good job. Takes a little longer than I would like but eventually gets everything. I put it in when I don't have time to do it by hand.
1,I doesnt work,"I bought it here in amazon with the Power Acoustik PTID-7002NR, I live outside of US and I payid the shippment, and the ipod doesnt work, I want to know if the will pay me back all that I spent just because they dont say that it doesnt work with all models... really bad...."
1,Big Disappointment,"The music is out of sinc with the video.You would think they could do better than that. Put the DVD in leave the tv off, enjoy the music"
2,Poorly edited...,"Like Jemina J and Bookends, this book was a nice, entertaining read. But all the comma splices drove me nuts! Who edited this thing?"
2,great album but won't work on an ipod,this is a great album but this damn content protected cd will not work on your ipod if you have an ipod buy the digital download its cheaper and least you can hear on the go
2,Dunham,Jeff Dunham is hilarious! I purchased 2 DVD sets to give as gifts. I ended up keeping one! It was cheaper to buy from amazon than to buy them in stores! Well worth the price at almost any cost! You should definately buy this item!
1,I should have known better...,"I do not do this too often, I usually try to remain positive. At this moment I am looking at my tax return that was returned to me by the IRS. I should have known that there might have been something wrong when the program asked me to find specific answers to my questions on the IRS web site. I use tax programs to help me file, given that I do not know all the current tax laws, I did not expect the program to ask me to find the answers to my own questions.Taxcut took me twice as long to file then when I use Turbo Tax. Errors were hard to correct and manual corrections would void your ability to file electronicaly. A full day went into preparing my taxes and now I will have to spend another day redoing my taxes with Turbo Tax. I do not think I will ever use Taxcut again.I would like to close this review on a positive note, but I can only say that I am positive that I will not use H&R's products again."
1,Don't play this on your PC,"This is a great CD, but don't buy it to play on your PC.It sounds awful on a PC. This disc has been doctored so that it plays differently in your PC than from your hi-fi CD player. You might just as well listen to it on a mobile phone.Poor Avril - she's been conned."
1,Don't be misled by the product description,"The product description for this book is in error. The description is for a translation of Johan Bojer's ""Den Siste Viking,"" about Lofoten fishermen. This book, however, is an old English novel about the Viking Age. Somebody is in error. Don't buy this thinking you're getting the Bojer book."
1,Caution!,"This software does NOT work with all versions of Mac -- will not install, and tech support pretty much non-existent (by phone -- no toll-free # and an endless series of holds; by email -- irrelevant responses). Probably an outstanding program for some, but a huge disappointment to this Mac owner."
2,She can bring you from laughter to tears and back again,"Slyvia Hotel is a personal CD which highlights the sensitivity of the artist. Highlights from the CD include The Days and Nights are Long, the title cut Slyvia Hotel and, for fun, check out Unworthy and the hidden track The Bank. A wonderful collection of songs.....so, pull up a chair and enjoy. Worth the long wait from her previous gem Mrs. Pinnochi's Guitar"
2,A Kitchen Must Have,"A KitchenAid food processor is a must have have even for the most novice cook/baker.Cons: Leakage. I do agree with the other reviews. I've also had leakage with liquid items like vinaigrettes.With that said, it is absolutely a trusty helper in the kitchen. I use it to process sugar for finer granules, chopping almonds, refining oats, making ganache, slicing veggies, etc etc. I can go on and on about its infinite uses."
1,0 star,"Why I gave it one star? Because it doesn't even power on although I bought it brand new. Of course I fully charged the battery! Of course i tried new batteries.I called canon, canon said I had mail it to canon for services and i have to pay the shipping to the factory.I asked how long to get it fixed and they said at least a month. I asked can I get a exchange and they said no.The body and lens are made with plastic. very cheap.For a product and services like this, it deserves 0 star.You gave it 5 star because you are lucky."
1,Doesn't work with a case,"This will not work with some iPod cases. I had an iTrip that plugged into the top of the iPod in the headphone that I loved. It stopped working suddenly, and I never figured out why. I bought this iTrip to replace it, but because it plugs into the dock connector, it wouldn't fit with the case on my iPod. It was too annoying to deal with taking the iPod out of the case everyday to use it, so I returned it and got another one that plugs in on top."
1,I couldn't even finish the book.,"I was hoping to read a motivational book; a book on how to get yourself up and going based on your own passion. No, this book tells you that you need God to do anything. Why not teach people how to use themselves and they're actual passion instead of a fear of God to get things going? I wish I could return this book, but unfortunately you cannot return Kindle books."
1,No Heat Neck Massager,"Just as Cynthia Fuben complained in her review, this neck massager produces no heat. The subtle vibration is pleasant but will not relax the tensed neck muscles without heat. Nice ad but poor performance. I suggest you look for a product that actually provides the elements that are advertised on the box. There are products in the marketplace that actually do what they claim, so I am going to return this product and find one that actually produces heat AND has a real vibrating mechanism in it. BEWARE THE WORD ""GENTLE VIBRATION"" !!!David Hall"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,Length:: 0:55 MinsMy name is Able and this is my reason why you shouldn't buy this DVD!
1,Don't be fooled by cheap pumps,"Don't be fooled by cheap pumps. This pump will do the trick but you will be exhausted by the time you pump a new tube up. Don't go cheap on hand pumps, spend $40-$50 bucks for quality"
2,Fast read.,"Compared to the UNSEEN HAND, Epperson's book is much less condensed. It is a good book to challenge what you always believed about history. Obviously ten years has since passed since written and there is much more to be said about an actual New World Order now than before. 8/10 stars."
2,Listen to the sound bites!,"This is one of those rare instances where I listened to a sound clip or two, then ordered the CD. Love it...the songwriting is great, and for a country CD, this album rocks! Listen to those clips and I would wager that you might feel the same way!"
2,"Reno 911, indeed",This coming-of-age (read: sober up and get a life) film is a fine example of independent filmmaking. Joey Klein gives a gripping performance and the biggest little city in the world never felt so hauntingly desolate and warm at once.
2,Wonderful Product!,I will never use any other type of make-up now besides bare minerals! The Matte Foundation is now a mainstay in my make-up collection!
2,Perfect Fit!,"I order a size 10 for an 11 yr old boy. They fit perfectly, right length, and had reinforced knees. What more can I say - they were perfect and arrived on time. Thank you!"
2,What a wonderful patriotic CD,"I've been searching for some good-sounding patriotic music and finally found it in this CD. The singing is awesome and the songs inspirational. The orchestra adds so much to the songs and it's really meaningful to me to know that this is performed by our own US Navy Band and Sea Chanters Chorus. ""America the Beautiful"" gave me goosebumps, it's the same rendition which was performed for President George W. Bush's first term in office. And the songs ""Hero For Today"" and ""The Last Full Measure of Devotion"" were new to me, but the lyrics are so meaningful. If you are a proud American and enjoy listening to patriotic music then look no further, it's all right here to enjoy!"
1,no receipt,Today is 05.19.2008 e I have not yet received the DVD and the CD.I am disappointedFrederico de Martins e Barros
1,"Jarring, irritating, and just plain inappropriate","As stand-alone music, it's alright; in the movie Troy, it was almost obscenely bad. For me, music can make or break a movie, and Horner's inexplicably out-of-place soundtrack definitely hurt my enjoyment of Troy. Yes, it's reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's Gladiator score, but when Zimmer did it, it enhanced and uplifted the film. Horner's slapstick imitation was too loud, too drawn-out, and too grating; instead of making the moment more emotional and evocative, the ""music"" overwhelmed the scene and destroyed it. Walking out of the theater, my first thought was not about the movie but about how awful the music was. With Troy's budget, I really can't believe they settled on this garbage for the soundtrack."
2,Language and Gender,"This is an introductly book for gender issues in the sociolinguistic context. You will find what meanings and problems are hiding behind language use, especially women's language. Aritcles in the book are intresting and easy to read."
2,Wonderful product,"I LOVE this make-up!!! I've used it for over 30 yrs...and now that it's not being sold in stores in the U.S....Thank goodness we can get it from Amazon.It's so easy and fast to apply..provides amazing coverage and is water based, so it lasts all day and is never greasy.FABULOUS PRODUCT !!!!!"
1,Terrible pop eighties sounding. Only 1 hit,Uh oh was the only song I really cared for. It's the only r&b sounding one. The CD sounded too much like eighties pop. Not very urban at all. Save your money is my suggestion.
1,unoriginal and average,"This sounds like a guy with a sweet voice drew a dozen cliches out of a bag and used them as lyrics...the whole ""sit on my wall"" thing is painful. It sounds like bad poetry a 16 year old boy, who is drunk on cider, would write. Having said that he can sing and delicate is redeams the whole record. Maybe next time."
2,# 7,Tommy has a birthday coming up on March 30th and I will give him seven books that day. He will be 10.
1,Not what I thought I ordered,"So I was really excited to order The Call of the Wild but the book I received is not what I thought I ordered. The cover of the book is different than the picture on Amazon.com and the book I recieved is an adapted, abridged children's version. I don't rememeber seeing anywhere that this was an abridged version of the book. I have no intention of reading the chidlren's version and now I will have to buy the unabridged version."
2,Better and Better,"This album took me by surprise. I lived in the desert for over 9 years, and the sounds and words take me back there. Complex simplicity, I underestimated the hold these songs would take on me. Ted is an amazing lyricist, and the melodies sweet and full of emotion. My ""album of the year."""
1,Explicit!,"Disappointing! This was the first Linda Lael Miller I've read. This library find was more than sexually explicit, so graphically and ongoing that I considered it light pornographic. No, I am not prudish! I've read many sexually explicit and sensual writers, however, this novel's puritanical cover distort's the reader's expectations. I found nothing especially captivating about either character, especially Emma. She wasn't strong willed, stubborn, spoiled, manipulating, or even innocent. Emma was oversexed from the moment her maidenhood took flight with the wind. She spent her time coaxing this man to satisfy her carnal desires throughout the book. Maybe Emma was no different from the average 'American housewife', the only difference being that her carnal desires and needs were met. Well, that is a feather in her hat!"
1,Doesn't Deserve a Movie,"In short and I know I'm not going to make many friends out there for this review but Muhammad Ali doesn't deserve a movie about his Draft dodging racist life. He was just an egotistical nightmare of what athletes should not be like, if you want a boxing story make one about George Forman or Rocky Marciano (the undefeated champion 49-0). In short Will Smith did alright but the basis of this movie and story are morally degrading."
1,Poor midrange; Sound delay.,"I have a Klipsch Promedia GMX 2.1 setup that puts these to shame.Tested with AudioTest and I can hear the Klipsch up to 17K and down to 40.The Bose is from 40-15K.The Klipsch are two way satellites with a sub-woofer.Great sound all around from the Klipsch while the Bose is weak in the mid-range.They sound ""tinny.""Also the Bose has a noticeable delay.I have a Mac Pro and use Sounds4Fun which plays sounds for various actions.I also have many macros that play a sound upon completion.Add clicks for every key press.The Bose misses a lot of sounds and there is a perceptible delay.The Bose is connected via USB and the Klipsch via line out.Another big minus for me are the proprietary connectors Bose uses.ALL the Bose connectors are proprietary except the AC (which is odd but available).The Klipsch has a DIN connector but they are at least available."
2,This book gives me a clearer idea of what I am looking for!,"For years I have been looking to find clarity and illumination in simple truths. I have been searching for simple yet profound undestandings that effortlessly and joyfully move me to greater understanding! And I have discovered such clarity and understanding in ""Journey of the Soul.""The author has elegantly described a process of ""an unfolding spiritual reality"" which spans vast areas of inquiry such as God, the Divine Feminine, mysticism, creation, purpose, states of consciousness, faith, surrender, wisdom, and love. He built this process in such a fascinating and sometimes poetic way that I am now confident that as I continue my journey, I have a clearer idea of what exactly I am looking for!Read slowly and savor the illumination!Priceless!"
2,Great book,"This book is about a young girl in Berlin during the holocaust, and follows her during her time in hiding with her mother. Quick read and worth the read!"
1,I would give it less than one star if i had the choice to,"Well. First of all, when i was younger i was a huge New Kids on the Block fan! (as every girl my age was back then..) But, well it's the 90's, and as i am sorry to say TIMES HAVE CHANGED, and voice levels have change too. As much as I love to see good looking men shake their asses around and look all pretty, i am going to pass on middle age men, who used to be something, that are now just washed up trash, dance around on mtv..no thank you. anywhoo. please refrain from listening to this song, or this album. I wouldn't have it, if i wasn't given it at a dance. i repeat..do not play this single ever! spend your money on something that is actually good.l8ter"
2,Very handy!,"I have attached this onto my D7000 for when it's needed and it really does the trick. It's nice not to have dive through the camera bag in order to find something to clean your lenses. The fact that it can attach to your strap was the most attractive feature and so far, it's been worth its price."
1,Good for insomnia,"If I didn't need this book for a class that I'm taking, I would never have purchased it. The material is very dry and mundane. Every time I try to read a chapter for my class I end up falling asleep."
1,disappointing!!!!!!,after i read the book on my kindle I was shocked to look back and be reminded it was a Lisa Jackson book. I normally read and like ALL of her books. I am not sure what happened with this one
2,last longer,"The H series battery gave us 4 to five times the battery life of our orginal batter with the Sony Camera, it also charged just fine in our camera."
1,Not what I expected,"I had ordered another exit book before, and it actually had the map of each interstate with the exit numbers right on the map. This one is not the same. It jumbles all the exits together and doesn't show you where on any map where the exits are located. I was extremely disappointed."
2,Fabulous!,"We found this book and my daughter fell in love with it! She is 8 and enjoys just sitting and reading the information. Whenever she gets inspired by nature, she looks forward to sitting down to research what information the Handbook of Nature Study offers."
2,Knight Rider,Great series.I wish they had continued making it. I am still trying to find the 2008 tv movie that started this series.
1,So-so,"I really wasn't thrilled with this tape. Quality was so-so, not a great buy even for a small price."
2,Fun movie for the whole family,"I first saw this movie {Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas/The Christmas Toy by Jerry Nelson, Frank Oz} over a dozen years ago and love the first then. Over the years I have bought every video of this movie that I can find just so I can give them to people I know that like good family movies. The last video of this movie I bought for myself and I still love this fun movie."
2,Great addition to the Buzz Lightyear costume,"This was a great buy. For the price there is no reason not to get it to go with the costume, it really completes the look. The wings seem pretty durable and I expect they will hold up well since my son will only wear this through Halloween and not on a daily basis. I can tell though that if he were to wear it more often that the shoulder straps would probably fall off in no time at all. They are very thin and flimsy. Overall I am very pleased, my son loves it and hasn't taken it off since UPS delivered it this morning!Update: Wings are still intact, even after my very hyper 4 year old wore them for Halloween last year!"
2,"Good book, except for one thing...","Overall, I think is a good addition to the NJO series. It's a little too short and underdeveloped in some aspects, but still a good read. Like many of the other reviewers, I enjoy reading about characters other than the main heroes, however, how could Zonoma Sekot go through a tremendous crisis without Luke, Mara, and Jacen - who were all ON the planet - not know it. That is a serious plot flaw, and it distracted me through out the entire novel. Since Keyes last NJO novels were awesome, it makes me wonder if he was at the mercy of an imcompetent editor."
1,Total Crap!,"This game is just flat out DUMB! Everything about this game is bad.The graphics are down right terrible.I've seen better looking graphics on the ps one.The game modes are VERY limited.All you can do is play a crappy story mode,which is a waste of time,and play one on one matches over and over again,in lame background areas.Why would I wanna ""backyard"" wrestle in a burger joint? The wrestlers are just laughable to look at it.Pass on this game.It's not even worth a dollar in my opinion.If you want a really good wrestling game for ps2,pick up WWE Smackdown Vs Raw 2011,and leave this piece of crap alone!"
2,ncis season 7,"NCIS season 7 is an excellent DVD.It has great characters and excitement,comedy, and drama.I enjoyed it thoroughly.I would recommended it to anyone."
1,VHS Review,"the VHS was listed as new on amazon, but was used and recovered with plastic. The movie was obviously used."
1,The first failure in the DC DVD animated movies,"Was to short and they just put extra stuff that the other DVDs already had like Hex and the Spirit. The story could have been about 40 minutes more and went into how Billy got where he was. It had more holes in it than swiss cheese and the bad guy was robbed of any real evil actions. Do not rent, do not buy, get it on Netflix then thank me for saving you the money. Did I mention the Blu ray really did not have any good extras and WB does not even let you put it on your ipod you get this stupid digital program and have to be connected on your laptop to the web."
1,Avoid at any price,I just lost my warranty replacement drive (and all data) the second time. My experience is that the disks work just long enough to load them up with data and then they turn into inert bricks. Maxtor replaced my first drive but their automated warranty replacement web site says I can't get the replacement replaced so I'm out my data and my money.
2,"Overall, it's really great","I was really happy to see this unique-looking whale pendant. A lot of killer whale pendants look like fat dolphins, but this one actually looks like an orca! Awesome!I was slightly disappointed in the differences between mine and the photo. The rostrum (nose part) of the whale in the picture looks really well done, but mine looks messy where it was soldered and is rounded like a beluga. Also, the loop at the top has a line down the middle, which is fine, but it is different than the photo. Mine also had a slightly sharp bit off side of the tail. Just be aware that the finished pieces aren't necessarily perfect, but for the amazing price, you really can't beat it!That said, I wear it often, almost every day. I love it because it looks like a WHALE. I love it so much that I got a second one to send to my friend who works at SeaWorld. She loves it too!"
2,Brent's Review,"Hello, if you love to dance and, you love creative dance steps, you'll love the new creaton from Fatima the best dancer, choreograher in the business.I had a ball finally mastering all the popular dance steps from the Backstreet Boys and the HOT dancer,singer extradinaire, Aaliyah. Im an aspiring dancer and Fatima taught me a wonderful routine to use at auditions. Buy this one, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
2,Good Tree for the money,Quality of this tree is good for the money. The size is what was really important to us and it is perfect.
1,um...isn't this already copyrighted?,"ok, i dont have this doll, but i must say that it bears a STRIKING resemblance to Pee Wee Herman!! AH!! just a thought..."
2,A very good beginner's intro to VB Database programming,"I agree with the other reviewers, this book could use a bit more proof reading, there are some errors. However, if you go through the book and type in all their code and try to figure out why some of their code doesn't work, you learn a lot. You won't learn anything by reading this book, you really have to get your hands dirty, do all the exercises. Overall, I was pleased with this book."
1,Not satisfied,"I bought this for my boyfriend who has a horrible cuticle biting habit. He said the stuff tasted nasty, and it probably would have done the trick if it didn't make his nails bright and shiny. He said there was no way he could attend client meetings with his nails painted, so he picked it all off and refused to let me apply it again."
2,REANIMATION Is Hella Good,"Thi Linkin Park Cd I Great If u like Linkin Park and hate thi album u dont like Linkin Park!!!!! Thi Tight ...Ablum Featur Jay Gordan,Kutmater Kurt, and A new Raper form the Bay Area(my home town)Motion Man,Jonathan Davi(from KoRn),Aaron Lewi(from taind) Plus many more people and many more of the bet DJ'"
1,eh,Didn't work for me - but everyones different. I always give something a fair shot - this one just didn't seem to help. Good luck for the rest of you.
1,deader than dead,"I had this two weeks and it died. (it got used about five times and died)Besides that, I've had cheaper ones and they were more powerful than this. It wasn't all that 'stimulating'. LOL!I wouldn't buy this one again, I have a california exotics that's still going strong a year later."
2,The dignity of subsistance living,"This is a fascinating look at the story of a Canadian sailor, John MacLennon, who enters deeply into the life of the Chukchi people on the Chukhotka Peninsula in Siberia. John at first is shallow and is repulsed by the Chukchi way of life, but in time marries a native woman and has children with her. He is reborn as a real human being, one who can see the Chukchi as admirable and dignified human beings living in a harsh environment that still provides them with what they need and love.The writing is somewhat flat, but the overall effect is mesmerizing. Read this book if you're interested in native ways seen from the inside. The author is himself a Chukchi and an important political leader as well. The sense of place is overwhelming and the characters are fully drawn."
2,a great thriller,"The story takes place in Mississippi. In the coastal town Biloxi, patients of Dr. Michael Sims are lost and sinister things are happening in the hospital. The other main character, Shannon Donnelly, tries to prove that her father, a congressman, did not commit suicide, but was murdered. With 'Donor' author Charles Wilson again shows himself to be a master of the medical thriller. Just like his excellent 'Embryo', this is a fast paced novel, well plotted indeed. If you firmly believe that a hospital is a safe place where sick people most of the time get well then 'Donor' will really scare you! The interesting thing about the book is that this, or something similar, really could happen in the near future. The novel shows how advances in medical science could backfire."
1,not historically accurate,"This movie is not historically accurate, so many lies as to what really happened.There are a few good books that have been written in regard to Mary Surratt and the military commission fairness in her treatment.Five members of the military commission did ask for life imprisonment instead of hanging herbut that was denied but then president Andrew Johnson.It would have been justice to actually focus on the 8 conspirators and their role in the death of Abraham Lincoln but instead had to make a political point in today's military tribunals.Read the book Assassination of Lincoln:A History of the Great Conspiracy by T.M.Harris,The Assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators by Benn Pittman.The movie the conspirator was total waste of time but mention extremely boring."
2,Not very consistant pieces,"The songs aren't all consistant, one moment it's quiet as a mouse, the next it's banging like trashcans falling over. The songs are all very pleasant, if not the typical mozart. The only noteworthy one I have to brag about would be #5 ""Jupiter"" is just beautiful. Only problem is, that it makes you jumpy, it just bangs and booms, though very thrilling once you get the hang of it."
2,John Schneider's Greatest Hits,"I heard him sing ""I've been around enough to know."" That was the first time I'd heard him sing. Fell in love with it. Was sorry to read that he may not make any more albums."
1,"so, did he or didn't he sleep with his mom?",Just wondering.And what is the story with the giant revolvers?The drug use was a plus. eighteen nineteen words.
2,Fun for Toddlers,"My 2 year old son just loved watching the balls pop up and then retrieving them to put back in. My 4 year old daughter played along also. You have to push down the pump to get it to go, but he caught on fast and was doing it on his own. Fun toy for toddlers, I also purchased it for my nephew and a friend's son."
1,My ants must not like peanut butter.,"These baits are peanut butter-based, as it says on the can. The ants I have seem to be drawn to sugary things, but they leave these baits alone. I'm going to try another type; I know some ants are drawn to some traps so I think it's mostly a matter of trying different kinds until I find one that these particular ants like to eat."
1,"Simple to Use software, but multiple flaws","I purchased this unit because after looking at the software is seemed relatively easy to use. The first unit arrive broken. The second arrived intact and worked as Dymo intended but not as I wish it would. The problem stems from the fact that the machine acommadates four different tape sizes, but only two cartridge sizes. If you put a larger tape in, for instance one inch, rather than 3/4 inch, you are stuck with the margin limitations of the 3/4 tape and thus smaller fonts. No way to override this is software."
2,"It's true, hard core gamers will have no life.","This title, I purchased the day it came out. Since them, I have created character after character. . I'm not sure when it will end.The graphics are quite simply some of the best we will ever see *point to note here, that with the other two add on games with dx10 capability the game is even better*.The character generation is the most comprehensive I have ever seen. You can either go simple, or spend half an hour designing your character.I give it five for addiction and good looks and the length of time you get for exploration and interration which is a seriously long time. It loses a star overall because of the other characters. They are *ok* but sometimes the voice acting is just uninspiring.Half Life 2, whilst not comparing, had very good character interractions. Oblivion seems to have spent the money on everything else and left the people out. It's ok, I forgive, I'm about to create another character ;)"
1,Bummer,I was really hoping these would help my ringing but they did not. It was worth a try though. Maybe it will work for you. :)
1,where to begin?,1)repeating cliches isnt funny at all 2)crumby idea isnt funny at all 3)actors(WHAT A DISGRACE TO THE TERM)arent funny at all.things that are funny about how high 1)how quickly this became rentable 2)the steady decline of price. thats all.
1,Too little burn time. Package was all bent up and leaking.,"The product arrived bent up, with fuel leaking from 2 of the tins. They were unusable and I was only able to use one of the tins. It has very little burn time."
1,Don't waste your money!,"At first they were fine, but over time they became nasty.These mats are great as non-stick surfaces, but almost impossibleto clean. A greasy residue remains even after being put throughthe dishwasher.NEVER put them in direct contact with food because they will makeyour food taste so funky that you will throw out whatever you bakedon them. At first you might think there was something wrong withyour recipe because it is a weird taste, but I can assure you thatit is the mat that is responsible and not the recipe."
2,A Great animated movie.,"This is a great animated movie. ""Trouble in Tokyo"" does justice to the characters and TV series while adding depth to the character profiles in this incarnation of the Teen Titans story. Not necessarily for kids under 5 years old; the animation is quick paced and could be scary and confusing to kids not accustomed to Japanese style animation."
1,Disappointing,I was two thirds through the book and still waiting for it to get interesting. I was quite disappointed as I am a Turow fan and have very much enjoyed his previous works.
2,Awsome Set,Saw this show live and it was awsome! If you closed your eyes you'd have thought you went back in time 30 years. As tight as ever. They've lost NOTHING over the years (except maybe a little hair).
2,A Book Like No Other,This story is about a boy who is going to visit his dad for the summer. While on the way there he is involved with a plane crash after the pilot has a heart attack. Brian has to survive in the wild by making shelter and finding food. He has to fight all the things that happen in the wilderness and starts to adapt. One night something had approached him in the night. He threw his hatchet and it made a spark. Will he make it back?I would recommend this book to anyone thats wants to read about some adventure and mysterys.
1,Hank the Crank,"I hate to be a stick in the mud and a crank but...UNTIL THEY PUT OUT A WIDE SCREEN DVD! Boycott this until they do!!! The picture is beutiful and the sound is great. It always was! The fraction diference DVD provides is nice BUT!!! Where is that extra third of the screen!!!! its my favorite movie BUT!!!! I've seen it in TV format. I'm outragously dissapointed! Buy the video until they take their heads out of the sand. i'll admit I didn't read the print that said it didn't include wide screen so... stupid on me. BUT!!! The very idea that they would put this classic out on TV format... MORONIC on them.... I have to admit, my mistake never crossed my mind. ......... WHY SHOULD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Remains best book about Gordimer,"There are now a number of critical studies of the Nobel laureate's fiction, but none replaces Clingman's authoritative guide. The book proves particularly useful to American readers, as Clingman provides cogent discussions of the historical and political setting of Gordimer's apartheid-era writing."
2,Inspired and enlightened me,"The first edition of Starware is a book I've read 3 or 4 times, and review every time I'm going to buy any thing related to astronomy. I'm planning on getting the 2nd edition soon. An invaluable source of solid information for a beginner or intermediate amatuer."
1,False advertisement - Blanket Pills,"I purchased this blanket 3 days ago. I actually washed the blanket (in a delicate cycle) before using it. Despite its advertisement of ""never pilling,"" the blanket continues to pill even after using 2 rolls of lint remover. I am still picking the lints off of everything this blanket touched. I still have not gotten a chance to use it and I am going to return this product. I wonder if the last reviewer tried putting their blanket in the wash and if it held up to its standard. What a waste of my time and money!"
1,no significant one,"I don't find the significant design of FLW in Arizona. I think Taliesen will be his significant design, and the significant of Taliesen in Arizona, is the site plan. But, I don't find them in this book."
2,UFO-The Secret Evidence slaps you out of your complacency!,"For all persons interested in this specialized area of mystery, you will have found your money well spent and you will know more about it all when your done watching!Share the knowledge with those who don't have access! Well done!"
2,Sturdy and powerful - not for bare hands,"I've hefted a few sledgehammers and I like this one the best. It looks and feels very sturdy - I'm not worried about the head flying off or anything.I use it for shovelgloving ([...]). I swing this everywhere and feel totally in control.It has a very rough (though not slivery) handle. This gives it a fantastic grip, but it will give you blisters if you swing it without gloves on. I assume if you're using a sledgehammer, you'll have gloves on anyway.I use it bare-handed, but that's because I want calluses, because calluses are manly. After two days of using it for 14 minutes, I am already forming some really cool ones. So for me, that's an upside.I have no complaints about this product. I don't see why anyone would."
2,POP POP!,This toy is just crazy fun. The little ones love to push it around and feel and hear the popping. Brings lots of laughter and smiles.
1,Probably a good book for women being abused,"The book was easy to order, it arrived in a timely manner and was in great condition. My only problem was that it was supposed to discuss men being abused by their wifes. But it did not cover that type of spousel abuse as it was advertised to discuss."
1,Boring and filled with gratuitous violence...,This is the most boring Buffy book on the market and it is filled with gory and disgusting details that aren't necessary to the plotline. I wouldn't recommend this book to even the most diehard Buffy fans.
2,What others might miss...,"In the taking of endowments, we all notice a slightly... queasy... feeling at the thought of the resultant life of the dedicate. However, if you read closer, you'll note that the giving of endowments, with few exceptions of coercion and greed, is actually one of the most beautiful things imaginable. To have so much faith and trust in your ruler that you are willing to give up the strongest trait you have for that person transcends any other kind of love imaginable.It should also be noted that, until Gaborn is under great duress, he is bound by an oath not to take endowments. He seeks to save mankind, and not drain them of their gifts.I believe that the nobility displayed by Farland is exquisite, and should be looked deeply into to note how the moral standards all around us are in error...."
1,Struggling to finish this book,"I bought this book because my mother lives in the Alentejo. I intended to read it and then send it to her. But I'm struggling to even finish it. I'm a college graduate, and I've read plenty of complex novels, but this one leaves me feeling like I'm missing some skill necessary to decode it. I think I need an English Literature class in order to understand it, and frankly, I don't want to put that much work into reading for pleasure. There are too many characters, with too little to tie them together, and sentences thrown in at the end of paragraphs that leave me thinking ""huh?""Others clearly love this book, so I realize this is just a mismatch between reader and style of book. But I thought I should write a review so that others who want plenty of accessible plot in a book know to look elsewhere."
2,Great,Good stories very interesting and detailed but sometimes this book is hard to understand what is going on or what the book is talking about.
1,Pans Stick!!,These pans are junk. DO NOT BUY!They stick very badly and are almost impossibleto clean. You would be better off with a regularpan.
2,Her Best To Date!!,"In my opinion, Janet has always been notorious for having little interludes after almost every song (see ""janet."" and ""The Velvet Rope""). On this 20-track disc, there are only 6 interludes. The remaining 14 songs are just great! Tracks 6-9 sound like songs intended for ""The Velvet Rope""(these songs are pretty explicit),but the other tracks are more ""kid-friendly"". My favorite songs are the title track, ""Trust A Try"" (I like the beginning of that one), ""Someone To Call My Lover"" (very tame and sounds like it was made for radio play...it might be her next single), and ""Son Of A Gun"" (lyrics aren't for kids on this one...Janet says the ""f"" word quite a bit). By using more songs on this album, this has to be her best work yet!! Keep it up, Janet!!"
1,waste of money,"I was so exited to get this product, thinking I can charge all of my electrics, such as DVD player and e-book reader on the road. But my hope was shattered as soon as I plugged the devise in the cigarette lighter; black smoke and burning smell from the fan. The only good thing is that I did if while my car was parked. It should have been disaster if this happened while car was moving..."
1,PATHETIC,"Chlo Grace Moretz is unconvincing and painful to watch in this insipid, vapid film that fails to even provide a modicum of pathos to the hopeful viewer"
2,size runs smaller.,"Comfortable and nice looking. My son wears size 3 now. I ordered size 4. However, this pair of shoes run smaller by 1-2 sizes, my son has to wear them with bare feet now."
1,Company Cheated Me,"In 2003 as one of the early users of Roboform I paid extra for a lifetime subscription to upgrades- Now i go to upgrade and they want me to start paying a yearly fee; no excuse or apology. A blatent taking of my money - Criminal. And they think that i would let them cheat me, pay them more money, and then give them access to all my passwords and bank accounts..."
1,These BBC versions of Wallander,"These BBC versions of Wallander lack the grit and everyday-Sweden feel of the Swedish TV series. Too much Branagh, not enough Sweden. Rather dark and hard for me to enjoy."
1,"Bad, very bad film",If this is Indy film making - you can have it. GoreGoyles: Mutant Edition - is nothing but trash. The acting was very poor. I'm sorry - there is nothing to say - other than don't wast the two hours it will take to get through this - it is BAD!!!!I am so glad I saw this on netflix and did not waste a nickle on this film - these people should be put in prison for corrupting the art of film making - the sound track - was horrible - you could see the boom and mic in some of the shots. What as waste of time. None of these people will ever get a real acting job - they are just that bad!!!!!!Larry - horror fan. The old time B horror movies are so much better than this junk. P.S. this film gets one star because I can not give it none-yes NONE - it is truly that bad!!!!
2,Great but overpriced,"(This much) for a corkscrew? They've got to be crazy, right? Actually, this thing works very, very well and is super cool looking. If you've got money to burn, it's probably worth it. If not, there are plenty of cheaper fancy corkscrews on the market. As a rule of thumb, never spend more on a corkscrew than what you spend on an your average bottle of wine."
1,Started out as exciting but became terribly convoluted,"I was looking forward to this tape but after the first half hour it sank into a morass of death metaphors and insecurities. Although I adore the work of Kevin Spacey, not even his considerable efforts could save this choppy audiotape."
2,Very Comfortable,If you want a great sneaker for walking and everyday use... this is it. Very comfortable and lasts a good long time.
2,replacement usb cable,"Lost usb cable for Canon camera.Unable to download and print school pictures,very happy to have found replacement and have it delivered so quickly!!!"
1,Worst rash I've ever seen,"I don't know if it's the pressure from my daughter sitting on the chair, or if she has an allergy to the plastic, but since we started potty training with this chair she has developed a horrible horrible rash. By process of elimination, and the fact that she has bright red stripes on her butt from where the plastic meets her bottom, we figured out it was the chair, and nothing else. She does have sensitive skin, but NOTHING would help her, and I tried EVERYTHING. We bought two and are returning both, and had to go with the safety first chair that has a cushion. If it weren't for the rash, I would give it a good review, because she liked it and used it, but the problems she has had are just ridiculous."
2,An album you can't stop playing,I recently saw this band play and it was by far one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. These guys were and are still way ahead of their time. You can't find any other bands that sound like these guys. Every song on this album is deferent. The only formula that they stick to is great solid music writing. It's so nice to put this album in and hear intelligent lyrics. The music is constantly changing within each song. Visit their website to get a little glimpse into the band. Look if you made it this far you obviously know what great bands are made of and this album should be in your collection.
1,"good beginner workout, but very dull","This workout is good for beginners, altthough Kathy does not stress form or even begin the workout with a good warm-up. However, I did enjoy the intermediate and advanced stepping sections and the stretch at the end. END"
2,LOVE IT,"GREAT PICTURE QUALITY, THE DISC WAS PERFECT, I LOVE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ITS VERY OUT OF THE REGULAR. THE ACTORS WERE GREAT"
1,Ultimate Ozzie & Harriet,"I returned this item unopened because I noticed that all of the episodes of the TV Show ""Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" in it were contained in the other product I purchased at the same time, ""Essential Ozzie & Harriet."" It would have been helpful if there had been a way to compare episode titles before purchase."
2,You can't have too many of these clamps!,"When I am working on projects around the house, I always seem to need an extra hand and these clamps do the job every time! Whether I am cutting, sanding, screwing things together or gluing, having clamps just makes a job easier and more professional.Get these clamps in various sizes and you'll complete your jobs faster and more professionally.These clamps are durable (I drop them on concrete all the time) and they hold up very well."
1,Near Death on Arrival.,I bought this and the larger model just in case of failure. Failures are seemingly common. It did not work. I sent it back. The other model worked. I kept it.
1,HORRIBLE,"I can't believe I read the whole thing. I kept hoping it would get better, that something would happen...nothing did. First of all, college kids don't act this way; as if they were 45 or 50 years old. Let's just say, there was way too much latent stuff going on between the friends and rivals and mentors...It just seems as if the authors promoted a lot of touching and male nakedness going on. Weird. If you got rid of all the useless drivel about Princeton, the book would be 10 pages long. It appears as if the authors wanted a memoir of their time at Princeton, not to actually write a story; let alone make it somewhat interesting. The characters were uninteresting and boring. The plot was way too unbelievable. The characters were able to walk around crime scenes and escape from police as if they were invisible. The authors were far out of their league. I wish I could have the time back that I spent reading this wreck."
2,Just like it said,"No problems, no issues, on time. The box set was nicely bound and made the perfect holiday gift for a fan."
2,Combo Saucepot and Steamer,"Just love this little pot. Have been a Farberware user for over 35 years and finally replaced my 3 quart saucepan with this gem. It's a great size for a small family, doesn't take up much room on the stovetop. Only concern is that the handles do get hot and you need to use a glove or towel to use the handles after boiling or high temps. I would recommend this pot to anyone in the market for mini-size soup/stew preparations."
1,FARCE!,Where is the medical research that backs this book up? Think twice before believing everything you read!
2,Cool product,"Really like the talking caller ID, but you cannot turn off the talking part, you can turn off the ringer at night, but it will still announce who is calling. The talking part is cool, if I am not near the phone I can just listen to who is calling and whether or not I want to run and answer the call or not. You can also add numbers and names to phone book and the talking caller ID will then use the name you have in phone book. So all in all I am very pleased with the phone, we just unplug it at night so it will not wake us."
1,SKIP THIS AND BUY SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY OR FIND HAUSER'S MUHAMMED ALI HIS LIFE AND TIMES,"If you love Ali get his own SOul of A Buterfly or the other bio - if you can find it, as it really gest into the soul of this great man, and into his depp and abiding faith, which is a place no one any longer goes.Of course if any of the three thousand or twelve thousand DO get to Ali and his family it will make up in a SMALL way for all the millions managers and damagers stole form him, and will get distributed to good working charitable and humanitarian organizations that actually help people, as Ali gives it all away to those in need, unless Bush has declared him officially a funder of bad and dubious causesso if it goes to Ali, live large y'allsting like a bee"
1,Terrible coffeepot,"First time i used it, it dripped all over the counter..tried again with same results, sent it back. I got a LEMON."
2,a harsh young book brimming with confidence,"I liked this book much more than anticipated. My initial expectation was a nicely written and overly poetic jumble about religion and identity crisis, probably a little too sentimental.Half right--Go Tell It On the Mountain is a powerful study of boyhood and parental expectation as well as the glories and the horror of religious conviction. It's more of a song, really, with dense, rhythmic prose that sings its song in a ramble that comes across almost like preaching. The effect is intended I would imagine, and produces results that are frequently stirring.This book transcends any mundane consideration of justice or political justification and breathes out a far more individualistically human story. A very quick read--"
1,what a disappointment,"based on all the other reviews for this book, i was really looking forward to reading this. when i got finished reading this all i could ask myself was ""this can't be all there is?"" the writer makes things way more complicated then they need to be, and there isn't anything earth shattering included. the basic stuff, he makes sound so complicated that you need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what he's talking about. this book contains information for the intermediate bowler, but he or she better have an iq of 200 to figure it out.save yourself some money, go bowl a few games and actually work on things that you need to fix. you know what they are. it will be a better use of your time and money."
1,movie script...,"The book has no character development and an obvious plot. He describes the technology in detail, but leaves the cookie-cutter adventure characters up to your imaginiation. It's a quick adventure story written for money and the movies. I may actually like the movie better than the book if it's done."
2,Great Charger for the Money,"I am happy with this purchase. The batteries fit the charger well, unlike some of the other charger reviews I read. It also has a light that indicates when the batteries are charging and when it is done. You can charge the batteries at home or in the car with all attachments included."
2,Larger than I expected.,"Seems to be well constructed, however, it is larger than I expected, guess I misjudged the ""1 qt. size"". I have had similar slightly smaller hand held paint pails that were more in the 2/3 to 3/4 qt size and they were much handier than this one. Still, it is functional and very well made."
2,Bruce Smeaton's At The Movies Soundtracks,"At the Movies is a wonderful selection and a terrific cost saver! I was looking for the soundtrack from the 1984 movie Ice Man. New soundtrack copies were unavailable, and used ones were being offered for $100. I searched for other projects of Smeatons and found an offering of a brand new copy of At the Movies, which not only contained all the original Ice Man tracks but included the beautiful orchestral tracks from the Australian TV series, A Town Like Alice. I saved approximately $77 on the purchase. It was a good day!"
1,NOT Playable in United States,"Region 2 encoding (This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV.)This DVD is not playable on American DVD players. The seller does NOT include that information in their own description and the only place it is displayed is below the main screen listing for the product information, where you will NOT see it until it is too late."
1,Pretty Turrible,"Yes I spelled terrible wrong on purpose, but honestly this movie was just awful. It can't have helped that I didn't realize it was pg or whatever before renting it, and therefore didn't get all the nudity and extremely graphic violence I was looking forward to. Anywho, the movie may be cool if you were into the books or are under the age of 9. Even though I was looking forward to imagined carnal undertones, this movie was lacking in every respect and I still stopped watching before the end, which is a big deal for me."
2,From an ex-Lonely Planet reader,"What's the first thing you want to know about a country? Why do I want to visit. For answering this question Insight guides do an excellent job. Interesting descriptions complemented by pictures get you interested in Chile and what the country has to offer. Comparably Lonely planet guides are like a phone book. There is more information in them - often out of date - but little effort or detail is put in about the features of the country itself. My only problem with Insight is that its informational section is lacking. My suggestion is read insight, determine where and when you want to visit and then seek out up to date information on hotels, etc. from another source."
2,The need to know basics of heart failure,"I bought this for my wife who has postpartum cardiomyopathy so we could really understand what the cardiologist was saying and doing. Prior to reading it we had been concerned that our cardiologist wasn't engaging us in many ""standard"" heart failure treatments that we had researched which might improve her daily quality of life. This book really helped my wife and I understand all the CHF jargon and, most importantly, what the heart meds do and how they are supposed to work in the body. Because of this book and other research we have engaged another cardiologist for a second opinion and learned that there are indeed other treatments and therapies available to us. Net Net - this book helps you engage in knowledgeable conversations with your doctor which is key to your survival and successful treatment.4 stars only because I wish the author had expounded more on some of the topics."
2,Polish version of Bjork,"What to say more ... very interesting electronic-kind of music and cool txt's. Don't think, buy it. You'll love it."
2,Very impressed,"Within two days of ordering, it arrived. I was impressed by this but even more impressed when I used it to crush some food for my tropical fish. I need to crush some shrimp and other fish foods for my baby fish. It worked perfectly. I can adjust how fine I wish to crush the foods. It is big enough that you can get a good grip on it and the threads work quickly when opening and closing. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs to crush something."
2,Cute and Educational,"My 18 month old received this as a gift when he was 6 months old -- it was definitely too old for him to operate it, but he loved to hug on it and listen to it sing. Now he can operate it on it his own and enjoys it, but it doesn't occupy him for more than a few minutes at a time, wheter he's alone or whether I am playing with him. Design-wise, I don't like that it interrupts the song it's singing if you push another body part. Also, the ear broke on ours after a couple months so doesn't seem super-durable (it hasn't gone through very significant toddler wear-and-tear as much as his other toys). But in general, it's a cute toy and fun to sing along with the songs."
2,Pretty good.,"Sadly, the first one I received did leak quite a lot. Amazon sent a replacement quickly which arrived the next day. I am happy with the cup, except it definitely does not hold hot liquids for 4 hours. At most, it's 2.5 hours. And drinking hot liquids is a bit scary since I can't protect my mouth as I would normally by 'puckering' up my lips."
1,Enslaved by Morons,"I had to force myself to finish this book. The author and his wife went through the same cycle for every animal: Buy/rescue an animal, don't research how to care for it, and try to make it sound like a hilarious adventure while said animal is sick or injured. In addition, his self-proclaimed aversion to manual labor makes him the worst person to own half their birds. This book could have had so much potential if only the author & wife possessed any bit of common sense."
1,end of the D-tones,"wow talk about scraps from white pony, you know when i thought about it, around the fur was influenced a lot by adrenaline but this album is an obviously just leftovers that they just forced out to make some money off their loyal followers from white pony. well ive never really been into this pompus band since the fur and i wont ever be again thanks to this album, besides there is so many briliant records out there right now to be hangin on to this for. the whole record, the intracate drum beats, the low distorted bass lines, the nasty riffs, and the signature flow and screams of chino are just absent on this travesty, its like they were trying to make a bad record, trying to be something they arent, sorry dtones go back to adrenaline and start over, or this is it."
2,An Archaeologist's best friend,"I used this as my first-ever archaeology field school tool and I was glad I brought it along. The handle didn't cause many blisters after constant use, and the metal held up nicely against tough, dry Southwestern soils. I'll be using Marshalltown for future endeavours."
2,Cute,Our kids 3 & 5 years old really enjoied; wasn't too bad for the parents either. Had a great message!! Perfect for family movie night.
2,the yellow strip,The swaddlers are definitely the best diapers out there. However I think they discontinued the ones with the yellow strip which turns into blue/green when it gets wet. Sometimes its hard to tell if the baby peed or not and having that color indication is an advantage especially in the early days of life when you have to count your baby's pees.
2,Moving.,"This is a traumatic movie (quality and all) that has a serious message attached not to spoil the movie but once you have seen this it will become very clear what life is all about. Given that this story is one that is very near and dear to me, I must say that this is a powerful movie and the information that is presented is one that will not be forgotten."
1,Don't waste your time.,"HORRIBLE! This is the most boring movie I've been to in years. Not only is it long (and lame) but it is completely predictable from the beginning. Many people walked out, as I should have instead of hoping for the movie to miraculously turn around."
2,"The Trump game is ""not fired""","My husband and I love watching The Apprentice. The Trump Game is fun, whether you are business minded, or just like to play games. One thing you should know is that it is a 3-4 player game. We did not know this when we bought it, but luckily have friends who enjoy playing with us."
1,Worst baseball game for PSX.,"I just got this game, and I only played it for about 15 min. The graphics are horrible, batting is hard cuz u have to put the little crosshair thingy on the ball. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is cuz it has a lot of stadiums including spring training in Arizona and Florida. If u want a good baseball game for PSX try Triple Play Baseball."
2,Trois 2: Pandora's Box,"In short, this is a entertaining movie. This is a sequel. The story is okay. The twist at the end was nice! Nice as in very very good."
2,Awesome for Fathers and Sons who like Robots,"At times yes this movie lacks the best writing but it makes up for that in its emotional intensity. The fact that he talks to his son during fights instead of keeping the eye on the ball, like the first fight, in the end comes together. At times the movie may not seem logical but in the end its a very unique movie, I sort of felt the same emotions with the movie IP Man."
2,The Greatest English Translation of the Greatest War Story.,"Robert Fitzgerald, a poet himself, and professor at Harvard,translated many great classics into modern English. HisIliad and Odyssey are the versions that come the closest inmatching Homer's orginals in both rhythm and epic scope.The Iliad and the Odyssey are the foundation of all Westernpoetry and every poet since, owes very much to Homer.The storyof Achilles' moral turnaround in the tenth yearof the Trojan war remains of the most moving and endearingtales, millenniums after it was written.Each of the twenty-four books of the Iliad in sparkling,modern (with a hint of archaic) English, make this theclear choice for English readers today. Quite possiblyforever."
1,Disappointing,"I've been drinking this tea for years as my standard morning tea. Recently Twinings changed the packaging and the ingredients - there's no flavor, tastes like water. I found a box at my local grocery of the old packaging and compared the two. Definitely has changed - much more flavor in the orginal version."
2,Something for every TMBG fan...,"I bought this CD/DVD combo for a two-year-old but found myself singing along to several of the songs. Plus, the bonus music videos include some for TMBG fans older than two. Recommended for anyone learning the ABCs or wanting to know more about the ABCs."
1,Karen Loves Herself,"I read a review that said whether or not you are a Bush person would decide if you like this book or not. Well, I am a huge supporter of the president and I have to say, this book falls short. I found it hard to swallow how highly this woman thinks of herself. I do think she was a good communications advisor to the president and I guess that is why I was expecting more. For the money, you are much better off with David Frum's The Right Man. If you can pick this up at the library, it might be worth your time, but if you are spending money, I recommend looking in another direction."
2,Let For Whom The Bell Tolls Love Waiting for a Girl Like You,"Hey! I'm the lover of Waiting for a Girl Like You. She's my girlfriend, and favourite song. You can't ruin her, period!! I love her. This 1 star idiot below me needs to die!! I can't read them at all. They get me on my nerves. Just let me and Waiting for a Girl Like You have a good time."
2,Very easy setup.,"If you have the Linksys Wireless G Router then the setup is very easy. All I did was press the button on the router while the card was plugged into my notebook and they found each other and established an encrypted connection. This card is working very well so far on an older IBM Thinkpad T21 running Win2k. At first I couldn't get my connection going, but when I realized I could just press the button on the router, everything was automatic. I don't know why other people talk about the thing getting hot. Mine is not hot at all. Overall, it's a great wireless adapter. Oh and did I mention I got it for only $22 new? That was the best part."
1,Book One was bad... this is worse,"Not only is this book chock full of negative spells, but there is one thing Sarah says that made me laugh out loud! In her first book, Sarah carefully explains how people will tell you ""Don't hang a ""lucky"" horseshoe prongs down, or the luck will run out"" and how this statement is wrong. She says, in book 1, that you have to hang it prongs down, to recieve luck. In THIS book (#2) she states ""Make sure to hang you horseshoe prongs up, or the luck will run out!"" Maybe Sarah should read her own work! Sarah means well, but this book is sensationalist junk. Please read books by Starhawk, Buckland, Cunningham, and others, instead of this."
1,Poor anti-war movie,"I am trying to decide if I am going to throw this DVD away. I watched the whole movie. It was the toughest sit through since ""Mosquito Coast"" with Harrison Ford. I do not mind watching a movie that is making the case that war is bad...war is bad, even though sometimes it is necessary. However, the movie itself jumped all over the place. As another review said, the relationships were poorly built. At first the animated portions of the film were interesting in an artsy way, but they kept coming back and were over used. The battle/war itself should have been more focused upon. The Crimean War was badly fought and this could have been a much better movie if it had shown the poor quality of generalship on both sides instead of just showing the character of the British and French generals."
1,Book full of incorrect information,"I must say that I'm genuinly supprised to see that anyone's willing to publish a book so full of mistakes. Not only a great number of caption texts of pictures are misleading and contain errors but there are may faulty statements in the actual text of this book. Most of the mistakes are obvious to anyone familiar with HK weapons (something the author clearly is not) but this leads to serious lack of credibility regarding the things the author writes about the history of the company. I will not be buying any more books by this author and I can not recommend this book to anyone. If you know HK weapons, this book has nothing to offer to you and if you don't then you are better of finding the information from better sources."
2,Good Product,"If you are looking for a product that has a long shelf-life, is compact, and will provide you will the sustenance you need in a survival situation, then this is it. I bought some to store in the pantry (about 3 weeks worth per person in the household) just in case we are held up in the house for an extended period, such as would be the case in a zombie attack."
2,Great service!,"While this shirt was out of stock when I ordered it, I was contacted by the Fashion Rack and offered a free replacement shirt in the available colors. I received the replacement shirt in a very timely manner and my contact was very generous and polite. Great customer service, and the replacement shirt is soft and light and is wearable for all kinds of weather.The hem is a little longer than I thought it would be, but it's a great shirt."
2,They've come a long way,I love A.F.I.!!! thier new cd i a great new sound you would expect from a.f.i. its still has the edge but its better musically. i recommend this c.d. to any A.F.I. fan. I recommend this c.d. to any music lover out thier!!
2,It's both gorgeous and a good read,"This has been my favorite book now for a couple of months, and I finally had to write a review that disagrees with the previous negative ones. There's no nice way to say this, but maybe there is a new money-old money difference in perception here. What I see in the book is one gorgeous and highly livable room after another. Lively, vibrant, personal and comfortable homes obviously used by real people. What I didn't expect was that I would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as I did."
1,"Gloom, doom, and scenery","I read about 150 pages and quit in despair-- all those looming mountains and historic old buildings, all those long silences and reluctant, drawn-out stories of Papa's past-- I wondered if we'd ever get to the vampires. Looking ahead, I did find Dracula, less entertaining than I had hoped, so I gave up. For really interesting vampires, read instead George RR Martin's ""Fevre Dream""."
2,Works great for gun cleaning really!,"Tood many years of plastic pick, cotten que-tips getting caught on parts, or spending entirely too much on small foam swab (exellent, just damnably expensive) I gave these open cell swabs a try. Very nicely done indeed. Holds chamicals, cleans, swabs. Very nice. I'll be picking up another box soon!"
1,Not pleased with this,I ordered two of the Long Arm Grabbers.When they arrived.One was nicely packed and sealed in the bag .The other bag was open. Upon examining these items I found the one in the open bag did not work.The clip holding the wire in the arm had come loose so nothing happened when the handle was grasped to pick up objects.It was obvious that this item was broken when I took it from the unsealed bag.I believe it had been returned as such and then carelessly reshipped to me.I did not return it as I had received Free shipping on the order in which it came.The cost to return it would have been almost as much as the item its self.I was very disappointed as I had ordered one for me and one as a gift.
2,Money Well Spent,"A Very Good book from a Very Good, life saving, Therapist! Thanks for the signed copy."
1,Trash,"A complete waste of time. By far one of the worst movies I've seen in a while, along side with movies such as Babel and A Prairie Home Companion."
2,You'll love them too!,"If you love Pooh and the gang then you'll also fall in love with the baby versions. They are so adorable and playful!!! The colors are great for a boy or a girl and the set blends nicely with pieces from other Pooh collections. As for the durability, it washed up well. No fading, shrinking, or loose stitches! It's great and you have to love those little guys!"
1,"Sophmoric, vulgar, dull and stupid.","Who in the world is hyping this movie? It is amateurish, irritating to watch, worse than a home movie on telephoto without jitter control. A trial to watch, the script consists almost entirely of f__k, s__t and variations and combinations. Very wearing. The story is non-existent unless you are afraid of the dark in the forest. And even then it's a stretch.A cult movie to be loved only by those who emulate the actors. An embarrassment to the school that produced these dropouts.A waste of time and resources."
1,Horrible replacement.,"I'm really upset with Bogen/Manfrotto. They discontinued my personal favorite head, the 3030, and replaced it with this one. Obviously, they did not ask photographers before making the switch. I had to buy a new tripod for our studio. We have several 3030 heads but since they were discontinued, I purchased this one. Everybody hates it. Simply put, it's clunky and seems to be very convoluted. The handles are extremely diminuitive. The quick release has gone backwards in engineering. It's the red-headed stepchild tripod of our studio and is constantly being shunned. We won't buy anymore. In fact, I'm using eBay to buy the old 3030. Bogen, bring it back! It's similar to when Ford went from the '64 1/2 - '66 Mustang to the '67. Why??? You had a classic.If you've never used this head's precurser, then you might like this head simply because you don't know how much of a step backwards it took."
1,It's okay. Just don't expect Mighty Sparrow.,"Both side are right in the ongoing disagreement about the quality of this CD. Yes, it has quite a few pleasant songs on it, with some Caribbean character, that many will like to hear. And, no, this isn't calypso by any conventional definition. At the very best, one could pick out maybe two or three songs that more-or-less fit into that classification - ""No More Rocking and Rolling"" and ""Barbados Carnival"", at least - although even those are not especially characteristic of the style. It's decent music, but not good calypso."
1,not so much fun,"we got this as a christmas present and my 2, 3 and 4 year never really even played with it. I tried I really did because I love anything trains but to no avail then the peices started to come off and in the end it just ended up in a heap with the rest of the blocks."
1,bad game- stinks,"You battle warrior after warrior. Don't you think that is boring? Well it certainly is. I have this game and the first level I played was fun, then the game becomes ssssoooooo boring! After the fifth level, I can't beat these stupid warriors, and I was endanger of throwing my psp on the floor. Terrible, terrible game. Also, the warriors look like monkeys in a colorful spacesuit! I suggest you buy some other game!"
2,Audubon Society Field Guides,Audubon Society Field Guides make great gifts for children and adults. I often give the books as gifts along with bird houses and bug houses. I always make sure that everyone knows that they should never kill any wildlife that is outside in our big world. I love my own collection of these books.
2,The Raft,"My daughter is 5 and loves this book, as do I. As we got to the last page, she said, ""Read it again!"" The illustrations are so beautiful and what a great way for children to see the beauty of nature. Another great thing about this book, is showing kids(and adults) that you don't need tv to have an amazing time."
2,Charming new CD from Bill Nelson,"This CD is a gem.Composed in the early 80's as library music this music has only now been released to the public. For those familiar with Nelson's music, Chameleon recalls his music of that era and doesn't feature the found sounds that are so common in his newer work (e.g. Whistling While the World Turns or the mammoth Noise Candy). That means more of Nelson's playing which is what attracted me to his work back in the Be Bop Deluxe days.Each song was written to create a musical atmosphere and Nelson is successful on every level in conveying those moods to the listener. In his liner notes Nelson refers to it as ""...an add little album, a curio in many respects..."" And that it is. But it's also a joy to listen to - well worth the twenty year wait."
1,DO NOT FIT,THESE DO NOT FIT SCION XB 2005 HOLES IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR FACTORY HOOKS.DRIVERS MATT CATCHES ON GAS PEDAL. I EVEN CONTACTED THEM ABOUT CORRECT FIT AND THEY DO NOT FIT.
1,"Lies, Lies, Lies","For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it."
2,Perfectly Balanced,"This is a great disc for a host of reasons. For one, all of the musicians are in peak form at the apex of a great time for jazz music. Moreover, the first half of the album is devoted to vocal jazz with Nancy Wilson on vocals, whereas the second half is all instrumental, with the heaviest influence on compositions by the great pianist Joe Zawinul.Song highlights include ""Save Your Love,"" ""Old Country"" and ""Masquerade"". Wilson has a very clear and precise delivery, and it works extremely well on this album. The band is very tight and the instrumental portions are well executed.This album is really two albums in one. Hit your random selection button and enjoy a great show."
1,Not the quality I expected,"I did not buy this from Amazon.com. It was bought at a local store. I used it for about 6 hours total over 6 days. It will no longer turn on using either setting. I've tried unplugging, waiting hours to try to use it again, everything I can think of and nothing will resurrect it. I love dremel's rotary tool, I own two of them for different purposes. Due to the quality and use I've had out of the rotary tool, I thought I was making a sound decision to purchase this glue gun. If you're thinking the same thing, DON'T be fooled."
1,A Gateway Drug - Please!,"This DVD is pure reefer madness. I saw it with a friend at his place. Every point this video brings up has already been debunked about a hundred times over in various books and blogs and newspaper articles.The real gateway drug is milk! That's right - it's where the vast majority of people who go onto things like heroin and meth got their start!Seriously, marijuana is anything but a gateway drug. It can actually help people overcome dangerous addictions and supply them with an extremely safe alternative!Don't buy this book and don't buy into the idiocy it proposes!"
2,Loved It!,I'm an Original Transformers fan from the original cartoon. There was action from start to finish and the Love Story didn't slow thing for me. I've watched this movie numerous times and still see things I missed the first few times i watch it. Loved It!
2,"beautiful story, pictures","i first discovered this book at my school library in the third grade, and fell in love with it immediately. it is a quiet story about a meeting of worlds--deaf human and silent mermaid--anyone who is interested in mythical creatures should read this book...jane yolen has some great details about them: mermaids have a fascinating way of speaking, for instance, using bubbles; and their tears are precious. i highly recommend this book to any children who are lonely or intrigued by fairies and the like. and you must see the pictures! beautiful realistic graphite drawings."
1,oh please,All I can say is why waste your money or time. This is so fakey it made me ill. I got to waste my time watching this poor dvd they call a movie. Beeing a Big Fan of Indy horror I was very well not pleased. This is TRASH...
1,Real review not just a DRM complaint,"I love games like Civilization and the sims. This is a bastardized version of both. It is insulting how little thought has gone into the complexity of the game.Also, I know this is due to the DRM, but I bought the game so I could play and when I am not on my computer my daughter could play too. She is not allowed to have her own account on my computer. So, if you have fmaily members without their own computer they are SOL.Worst purchase I ever made."
1,Worked for a while.,"This product worked for about 10 months, now it doesn't work. Maybe mine was made on a Monday or Friday...Hopefully I can return it."
2,Good quality lead,I've been using a lead holder now for a few months and have almost sworn off mechanical or regular pencils. This lead is generally very smooth with few if any burs in the lead. I have run into a few issues using regular white copy paper when sketching where I'll get a burr or two but otherwise no issues. Great for shading or line work. I'd suggest picking up this hardness as well as any favorites you might have.
2,work great!,These lifting straps work great. Once I got up to shrugging and dead lifting 300pds. I noticed my grip was slipping. Now that I have these straps I can lift with confidence!
1,HO Train,"I was very disapointed in this item. It fell well short of what I expected. Even with the discount, In my opinion, this product is way way overpriced. The picture of the item on the web page was very misleading. It would have been nice if The web page had a more elaborate description to include the length of the item. I needed a HO Locomotive right away to use pulling our train around our Christmas tree. Amazon was very convenient, shipping was free and time was short. Item did arrive before the expected delivery date. The Locomotive was an HO but I had a constant problem keeping it on the rails especially when the train went through turnouts. When used with an assortment of various HO railroad cars the Locomotive looked to small and just didn't blend in at all. Since we only run the train at Christmas I will be shopping for a replacement before next Christmas."
1,Could have been better,"50+ year after the birth of the Foundation series, I would have thought the authors behind the Second Foundation Trilogy could have thought out a better story.They weren't true to Asimov and I felt like they had been watching too many Star Trek the Next Generation episodes.Hari Seldon was examined by Asimov in his last few Foundation books. What is still missing is - what's next? Instead we get another look at the decaying empire and worthless trivia.Hari Seldon and Isaac Asimov are both rolling in their graves - I forced myself to finish this book."
2,A-Plus,"My 9 month old grandson just loves his grand piano...the lighted keys, melodies, and various options for different kinds of music make this toy one he will use for years to come. It was one of his best Christmas presents this year!"
1,no tide and the ship sunk before launching,"Totally disjointed. There might have been some good elements of this movie, however, I slept through a portion of it and may have missed the one or two minutes of actual plot."
2,Worthwhile purchase,"With the birth of our third baby, we decided to upgrade our monitor to this, the Sumer Day & Night handheld monitor. With our previous two children we used the Summer Day & Night (non-handheld) monitor. The picture on the handheld version seems to be a lot clearer and the convenience of being able to carry around the monitor is worth every penny. The sound quality is unbeatable - we can even hear our baby breathing through our monitor. The only negatives we can say about this product is that the other (non-handheld) monitor is not compatible with the new camera. Also, the size of the monitor (1.8) could stand to be a bit bigger, but the next size up (the 2.5 screen size) is a ridiculous jump in price. That being said, I would highly recommend this monitor."
2,nice toy,"Gift for my Grandson, he likes it and it has held up just fine - even with abuse by his 18 month old brother."
2,Anna Karenina with a hint of Woody Allen,"I'm normally not a fan of love stories, but this novel is so funny and poignant, I felt compelled to weigh in with my thoughts. The author's insight into his characters -- both Russian and American -- is so sharp that when I put the book down I still felt they were in the room. The comedy and tragedy of the romance between the sweet, neurotic Daniel and the quixotic Katya holds you to the very last page and beyond. Excuse the pun, but after reading this work, it's extremely hard to leave Katya behind."
2,Great,For over three decades this has been one of those recordings revered by all but the most jaded amongst us.Give it a listen. You'll know why.
1,"Ditto, don't waste your money","We've had this telephone for about one year, and we love the features. However, we've had to replace the battery already (the replacement is very expensive, as batteries go). Also, the phone is constantly muting -- it makes a terrible clicking sound, too -- resulting in having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over. It must be channel surfing, but there is no need for this. I will be buying another phone, but not a Sony."
2,"gets a little deflated, but it is as it's advertised","a squishy ball filled with sand. you can pump it up with more air. it's got a nice rubbery feel, nice and sticky/tacky for grip. nothing to it. gets the job done."
2,Great movie now available on blu-ray,This is a classic that deserves a place in the all-time great movie listings. Blu-ray just makes it better.
1,Didn't work at all,"The light on the charger never lit up when I plug it in, and my Razr never recognized it as a charger."
1,Could have been good . . . but it isn't.,"Domanick never has the courage to admit it, but his writing proves it. He is yet another of the shrill, mean-spirited left-wing radicals that dominate American journalism. His far left extremist views continually cloud the facts in this book. He paint's 95% of the LAPD as horrible Nazis and child abusers. Frankly, this book does nothing to explain the history of the LAPD, or the root of it's troubles. It mearly provides an opportunity for a deeply disturbed author to vent his mean spirited rage at those who are better than he. I reccomend this book only as an example of the downfall of American journalism."
2,Superb collection of short stories about southern life.,"After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness, birth, death, and sibling rivalry. The author lives in rural Georgia and was obviously very observant and sensitive during her formative years. Her description of her family is painted with love and emotion and in such detail that the reader feels that they know every intimate detail of her family life. This book IS the life of a southern lady. All southeners and those who want to share the southern experience must read this book."
1,Warning - these are re-recordings,"These are re-recordings of 20 great songs that are all available elsewhere. However, the price is a good bargain. I should point out that the photo of the cover shown on Amazon is different than the one on the CD I purchased, even though the content on the disc is identical."
2,The answer to success or failure in business,"I first read The E Myth Revisited as I was preparing a local policy and procedure manual for my second small business, a national franchise. As I read the book a light bulb went off - in fact several light bulbs flashed - and suddenly I realized why small business seemed so difficult. I had indeed been more of a technician in my first business - working more IN the business than ON the business. I am now a Small Business Consultant and Michael Gerber's words ""Work ON your Business, not IN your business"" still guide me today.Dick Bendtzen, Author of ""Yes You Can Start And Run A Small Business"", and Principal of Small Business Yes You Can LLC."
1,Sneeky!!!!,"The 4 volume collection of Danielle Steel's As it read 4 volumes and I got 14 CD's and 2 are not there. I too did not read the senders commet's and 2 of the so called 4 pack volume are missing.... I am very upset, this was to be a Christmas gift......CC"
1,Lame,"I agree with the previous reviewer who said that most of the stories in this book have already been told in the late Ron Luciano's books (The Umpire Strikes Back and Stike Two). However, the stories were better told in Luciano's books than in this book.The last few pages of the book dealt with Kaiser's whining about being ""fired"" during the aborted umpires strike. This was when the umpires submitted letters of resignation, but most of them took them back when they realized that the Commissioner's offices were joing to accept them. The Commissioner's office didn't allow Kaiser to take back his letter, so he really quit instead of being fired. I'm sorry, I have no sympathy for the man. He blew it. The reason why the commissioner's office did not want him back was because he was a lousy umpire. But I am really sorry that I bought this book. If I had to do it all over again, I would wait until it is in the $... clearance bin . . . I then I would still hesitate before buying it."
2,You got to have MUTTER,"This wicked jamming band is vicious with there rad vocals, jamming guitars, wicked bass line and rockin drums. Metallica, watch out because Rammstein is what you use to be. Check them out at their official site and catch live if you can"
2,Very funny and great quality,"These are great postcards, and they ended up being much funnier than thought they'd be.None of the cards are dirty. No 'bad words' are used, nor is there any sexual innuendo. They're predominantly funny little sayings that reflect the sexism of the 50s with a modern ironic twist. Great images and some really funny lines. Strongly recommended."
2,Amazing!,"I love this book, because it is full of ideas to interact with your baby while allowing them to learn! As a new mom I had no idea how I was supposed to ""play"" with my newborn and this book gave me lot's of ideas."
1,You only rent this printer...,"Here's the other side of all those Amazon reviews that start with ""I just opened up the box, and the print quality is great!!"" This machine slurps up ink. When the color cartridge runs out, the printer refuses to print anything (like that black & white page you really need right now) until you put in a new cartridge. I'm sure the Epson folks would tell you that the ""right"" approach would be to always keep extra ($$$) cartridges on hand. Of course, the alternative is to buy a different brand."
2,kiss me kiss me kiss me!,"Hello bros wassup with the kissing stuff, this movie is a lot a like to Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, but it has it's own ideas and history, is the ever topic of popularity, cheerleaders, love and the happy ending, but the funny jokes are good and the sad moments are really, wearlly teary, who didn't felt sorry gfor Jossie Grossie when the guys throw her eggs, that's sad, sad, sad, sad, this movie is great and entertaining, and Miss Barrymore has always a believeble acting."
2,Deadhouse Gates,"I normally don't write reviews but I had to write one about this book. I just started reading Steven Erikson book on the Malazan Empire. People have said that it too many characters to keep track off, but it really isn't. You will have your favorite characters and you will also have characters you dislike so much (you just want to choke them). This is the second book I have read so far in the series and I cried like a baby. A lot of books don't touch me as much as this one did. I really think you should give the series a try, starting with Gardens of the Moon. I plan on order the next 2 books and I am happy with the series so far."
1,Assembly is PAINFUL,"Rating only for Assembly. Purchased stand even after reading other reviews. Have just finished putting together. The other reviews are correct. Lots of pieces and instructions are terrible. Only provided a black and white copy of original Instructions. Hard to see pictures, poorly written, and difficult to follow. With that and some guessing, you will eventually get it together. Several times had to undo and restart some of the steps. Shouldn't be this painful. Bosch needs to start over with the Instructions. Agree with others that would have been helpful to assemble more of it at plant but I am sure Bosch picked cheapest packaging option -- as evidenced by the Instructions.Haven't used yet. Stand appears to be sturdy. But the trade off is the stand and the Bosch saw together will be heavy -- right at 120 pounds (75 lbs for saw + 44 lbs stand). Something to consider if ever have to pick up both pieces at once.Amazon ordering and delivery time (standard)was exceptional."
2,Wonderful. And it includes filters!,"Though not in the text of the product description, this includes enough filters for about a year of brewing (depending on your coffee intake). I'll just echo everyone else's thoughts here - the Aeropress brews a delicious, smooth cup of coffee, with easier cleanup than any other method. It's a bit odd looking, like a medical device, but is built to last. This, in combination with a burr grinder likeHario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinderis pretty much the best you can do with coffee."
2,"suspenseful, and extemely entertaining.","Thomas Harris has once again brought the intriguing character of Dr. Hannible Lecter back into our lives. Throughout his books the reader wonders ""Why would someone do what he does? What happened that made him the monster that he is?"" Our questions are finally answered, and in a way that almost leaves us feeling sorry for him. The book had me turning page after page; Never expecting the story that unfolded with each paragraph. This book is a great read for people who use their imagination to see what happens as they read. I can't wait for them movie to come out. I want to see if the director and actors will act it out as I saw it at 2:30 A.M."
2,Great game. nice book,For those of you who played Legend of Legaia you should know that the arts lists alone are worth the price of this book. There are quite a few mazes in this one too to which the book helps infantly.
1,Not good quality. And the sizing is all wrong...,I was pretty dissapointed when I bought these shoes. They look great in the photo but they have the sizing all wrong.. They run a complete size larger on many of their lines and you cant tell which lines are sized correctly and which arent... its a toss of the coin.I bought these in a size 9 but they really were a 10. They were a complete inch larger than my foot! I couldlnt believe it... I have tried other shoes of theirs and Id have to say 80% are sized too large...Its not worth the gamble...
1,Garmin Portable Friction Dashboard,"Too heavy, not functional or practical and not necessary since GPS is delivered with windshield suction mount."
2,"""Looking back in anger"" with a sad tune!","There's only one way to remember them:readingand humming the ""song""they inspire along thepoetical and invoking lines of an almost shamanicincantation rising to bring them back intolife so that we meet,know and re-bury them with love andawe,with respect and recognition ofa sacrifice as supreme as crucifying itself.They are all deities in the lost and sacredsociety bush of ancestors long forgotten and recalled when the moments aresupreme, when it comes to love, lifeand death: Beloved, Macon Dead, Violet, Circe..."
2,gut-wrenching,"This was the second time I've seen Crash and I forgot how riveting it was! Ensemble cast is terrific, special kudos to Bullock for stepping out of her comfort zone."
2,Great china repair,I used this product to repair the handle on a beautiful oval china vegetable dish which had belonged to my late mother-in-law. It was a wedding gift in 1913. The handle had broken off in a recent move. It dried to a seamless invisible line. I'd give it 5 stars but I haven't yet used the dish to know about how it holds up to use.
1,Did More Harm Than Good.,"At first it seemed pretty good, it really hypnotized me. Then it gets to a part where they bring you back in time to your first cigarette. This eventually gave me an 80's attitude towards smoking and I ended up smoking extra. So actually it worked backwards. I'm now struggling to get back the progress I had made before ever listening to these tapes. I would recommend you stay away from these tapes."
1,"Bought TWO, both broke.","The penguin leaked it's whole gallon of water all over the room (fast) before I figured out what was going on, and the frog broke after one use. When my husband tried to fix the leak on the penguin (no dropping, came out of the box that way) it never worked. I was coming to Amazon to try and find a humidifier that actually works instead of more plastic and electronics for the landfills. Very frustrating. Must admit, I bought it elsewhere and waited too long to return, so nothing Amazon did wrong, but it's not a good product. Two strikes."
2,Full of Thrills,"Jessica Tregarth is unwillingly towed into a mystery when two sinister and mysterious men follow her throughout England on her vacation to her grandfather's house. For unknown reasons the men say that they want an ancient ring Jessica processes, and Jessica confused, refuses to give in. She meets up with David Randall, a novelist, who decides to take her under his wing as they set out to solve the mystery of the ring, her grandfather's strange conviction that the remains of Camelot lie on his property, and the motives of the two villains that pursue her. With all it's action and adventure this book is definitely hard to put down. The reader is thrown into the mystery and adventure from the book's very beginning. Elizabeth Peters does a terrific job of creating the character of David. He's wit, charm, and daring all woven into one. The romance and Peter's blended in sense of humor are a refreshing bonus throughout ""The Camelot Caper""."
2,Great watch for super price,"This is a very good watch, super big face so I can see it without putting on my glasses. And with a 10 year battery, I should be set for many years to come."
1,Not worth the plastic it is made of.......,Product is very cheaply made. I purchased two of them and the timers do not work. Also the parts do not fit together well. Do no waste your money. Very disapointed.
1,Tasted a bit artificial and too pungent.,"Didn't taste at all natural like a real key lime pie. I recommend that you skip this flavor of this product and instead try the lemon and strawberry flavors, which are much better. They have a more natural taste. On the positive side, this product is sugar free, low in calories and easy to make. In general this company's products are very good. It is just this particular flavor of the product that is lacking."
1,The handle broke off after 1 week,The handle just came out of the slot after 1 week of use. I would think that these backpacks should be sturdy enough to last at least on school year.I would not waste my money on this product.
2,"Not the complete soundtrack, but OK nonetheless","I was a bit disappointed to find that some of the songs from the film (e.g. the Gene Kelly songs) were not included in this collection. Still, a fun romp through the mid sixties and some of the upbeat, bossa nova-inspired music of the time."
2,powerful tool,unfortunately it was confiscated at the airport.I liked it a lot. I put it together with my keys.
1,"If you bought it, trash it... if you didn't, don't buy it.","No, I don't think so. I wasted my money on this record only to discover it was a feather light production (has that sort of brittle, plastic sound you hear on the Faint's ""Wet From Birth"" record... it fits there, perfectly... but here, Conor's trying to have ""soul"" and all that other good sh*# that comes with the territory of what he's trying to do) and diluted rehash of the general tone of his releases. This does not nearly reach the high water mark he set with the beautiful, organic work known as Lifted. If you dig that vinyl sound, and the pure kinetic weight of those drum fills you hear in ""Lover I Don't Have to Love,"" all the little mistakes and candid live band sound... you are not under any circumstances going to find it here. If you think this is for you and you don't have Lifted, please get that instead."
1,Poorly made,"Gave this to my 14-YrOld son who has already mastered other Rubik's puzzles. This one was a disaster right out of the box. Super stiff and won't come apart so he can lubricate it the way he does with his others. Terribly made. It could be fun and educational, but not when it won't work!"
1,Absolute waste of money- will not create a viable DVD,"Absolute waste of time and money. #1: install disk has a setup file that causes install not to work on some machines. Have to figure out on your own, through vague knowledge base, then download proper setup file and copy everything to HD to install. Already that's a lot of time wasted. #2: unable to consistenly capture from Sony D8 camcorder- MyDVD drops it intermittently, other capture apps capture fine. #3: after going through hoops to get video captured and ready to burn, after one or two failed attempts at burning (stability issue), final disk is not usable because audio and video are out of sync. #4: tech support is a joke. Nearly useless knowledgebase, unresponsive tech support staff. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WASTE LOTS OF MONEY AND TIME."
2,Boonie hat,"The hat fits perfect, used their guide to get size. I am a Scout Leader and will wear it to many Scout Camp outs."
1,UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS PRODUCT,This thing sucks! I used it for a few years until one day the combination changed. I wish I'd read the reviews on here before I purchased this piece of crap. Like someone else I just banged the crap out of it until it broke. thankfully Dell makes such a good computer that a few bangs did no damage. I HATE YOU TARGUS!
2,"""Childsplay""- killer band","I grew up in the northern va area and had the pleasure to see childs play live and it was a rockin, rockin show I had forgotten how much I enjoyed thier music. dont ask why but just out of the blue started hummin the song 'MY BOTTLE"" and thought about them looked on amazon and found a copy of the cd can't wait to get it.I use to go to clubs to see bands all the time at the wax museum,jaxx,uderground,bayou etc and these guys were great. i wish they would have stayed together a lot of potential was there, if you can find the cd I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET IT !! I'm 46 now with a wife and 4 kids when cd arrives the whole house will hear it on super high volume,wether they want to or not.""IF IT'S TOO LOUD YOUR TOO OLD"" SO LIVE A LITTLE LIFE'S SHORT!! Rockin Mike"
2,The Mockingbird's Song,"This a lyrical novel, written from a child's point of view, of the South, racial prejudice, and courage of one man. The child's point of view softens the hate and violence, but permits an innocence that promotes the theme of emerging conscience. Scout, Jem, and Atticus are well defined characters who form a loving family with children growing up amid ""the Southern problem"". The subtheme involving Boo Radley is tender, as the ""monster"" turns out to be a kind, but withdrawn, man (played by a young Robert Duvall in the movie version). As is often, but in this case truly, said: a must read."
2,I'd watch it again!,"I enjoyed this movie and would watch it again. Story line was a little predictable, but, it was still worth renting."
1,"Stupid, pointless game","This is not a fun game to play. You basically just run around a hospital doing random boring tasks. Also, don't be fooled by it being called ""ER"" and being made by Legacy... YOU DON'T DO ANY MEDICAL PROCEDURES AT ALL; there is nothing scientific about the game. Well, at least in the first few levels; I uninstalled it after that.If you are a huge ER fan and aren't interested in the medical aspect of the show somehow, then perhaps you might want to buy it. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
1,Doesn't look like what I ordered,"The item I ordered was a Menorah that looked more natural, the branches were random. The one I received is straight and traditional looking. I am not happy."
1,Papal Sin: Book of Deceit,"Gary Wills one of the biggest ""anti-Catholic Catholics"" outdoes himself in this book full of lies and utter trash. He spouts such anti Catholic garbage such as Catholics think the Mass is ""magic"", he mocks an elderly Priest who he used to serve at the Alter with by mocking the Priests reverence for the Mass. He makes outrageous claims like the last supper had women at it but they were censored out by the Church. He claims to be Catholic but has no respect for the Priesthood calling Priests ""the peoples eunuchs"". He mocks laymen who believe in the Papacy and the doctrine of transubstantiation. He flipantly suggests God creates abortions when women have a miscarriage. Wills calls St Edith Stein a false saint (she died at Auschwitz)saying she was a tool of the Church. The list goes on. Many liberal Catholics find this book as detestable as Catholics. It's one thing to have opinions regarding the Church but another to publish a book full of lies."
2,Excellent!,"I think this is a fantastic series that goes into great detail concerning the Rapture and Tribulation. This is actually much more fulfilling than the movies themselves (and don't get me wrong, I do like the movies a lot, and I own all of them). The movies are more for entertainment though, this DVD has more ""meat"" in it, and is much more detailed. I would recommend this to anyone who is studying Bible prophecy. EXCELLENT!"
1,Beware non-Christian followers!,What a suprise to buy what I thought would be a cute book for my 3-1/2 year old neice who is moving to a new house and instead find 3/4 of the way into the book that it is about Jesus! For those that are not of the Christian faith... beware!
1,Wireless Jack,Worked fine for a couple of months and then quit all together. Previously used an RCA model which also only lasted a short while. I had them hooked to a satellite receiver.
2,Grand Theft Auto IV,"I had never played any of the Grand Theft Auto games but after playing GTA IV, I am a fan :) Ready for Grand Theft Auto V"
1,Pretty but Painful,"These shoes look really nice and were just what I was looking for in a pair of casuals. The insole is cushy and feels nice to walk on.At first, anyway. I cannot say the same for the rest of the shoe. The grommets in the collar near the backstay (where your achilles tendon meets your heel) are hard as nails and dug holes in my heels that have yet to heal after buying them last week. And this after only a couple of hours wearing them around the house. I don't think I will wait for them to break in because I can't see why a pair of shoes should do that much damage to my feet in so short a time. Not at this price, anyway."
2,Works like it should,"We just got back from our trip to Europe with the both of us wearing Rick Steve's moneybelt. It seemed to work fine the way it should. The silk was great as it did not add that much more bulk and sweatiness to our outfits. Only one thing I question is the strange unfinished end of the strap of the belt. It was undone (not sewn up) so when we got it, it was already unraveling. We had to use a lighter to melt/burn the end so that it would stop. Weird design."
1,missed the mark for entertainment or holiday music,"We were excited to have a new musical addition to our holiday collection. I felt that they tried hard to create a story that would enable them to veer off into various holiday songs. It was, for me, missing on both the musical score and the story itself. Most kids, teens and adults will become bored in the first 3 songs and move on to something else. Sorry, but this missed the mark in our opinion. The orchestra is great, the cameo appearances by known artists were okay - it just didn't meld into anything noteworthy."
1,Junk,"Quite the worst film I have ever seen in my 76 years!The inadequacy of the above rating system reminds me of the story about the old Danish professor who found himself forced to modify the usual marking system in order to do justice to the proficiency of his students. In the usual system the highest mark was 6, 4 was pass. He had to extend the system downwards to -23. I give this movie the mark -24."
1,Awfully pointless and pointlessly awful,"""A masterpiece,"" says Roger Ebert, so going by that and other rave promises on the DVD cover, I rented it. I'll know better next time. What a meandering mess. What a cheat.These fine reviews remind me of when John Stossel of ""20/20"" got some kindergartners to create messy freestyle finger paintings, then stood back and laughed as ""serious art critics"" glowingly analyzed the greatness of these sloppy, meaningless creations.There is a sense, while watching UNDERTOW, that the youngest actor in the film wrote the dialogue, or else the actors simply made it up as they went along, with the director cueing them to be sure and disconnect all thoughts mid-sentence. This movie flatly refused to be interesting. Therefore IT IS SURELY ART.This was not ""atmospheric,"" so if you're from anywhere outside the back woods of the Deep South, please don't be fooled that this is how it is."
2,Nice binoculars,4 stars out of 5 only because they are a little bulky but they are clear and easy to zoom.
2,Fine,"This album is much more predictable, as we come to know what you're expecting from KISS, with all four original members doing vocals. A much more metal oriented album than any of its predessors. It is with this album KISS lost their ability to shock people, and it comes across as fine music. Because they could no longer shock people with their music, many bands resorted to freakish/ outlandish statements. Key tracks are: I Stole Your Love, Christine Sixteen, Shock Me, Love Gun and Hooligan. Contains lesser known filler as on Destroyer. With this album, Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over and Alive!, KISS was the first musical group to have four albums on the Bilboard 100 simultaneously."
1,Good for +/- 1 year,"This is our 3rd steam vac for home use. Our first was a hoover and it did a decent job for about 5 years. Our 2nd unit was a different brand that was less expensive, but lasted only about 2 years. So, we decided to get a new Hoover SteamVac with Clean Surge. After only 1 year, the brushes have stopped spinning and the cleaning solution leaks internally onto the carpet. Even worse, the hand held device is completely worthless. Leakage at the base unit leaves a big puddle, the spray will not turn off when not engaged and the suction is ineffective. Total frustration trying to work with this machine. I am in the process of researching for a better product. One that works as advertised and will hold up to more that 1 year of occasional use."
2,Review for ds game folio,"I just recieved the ds game folio and after examing it, it's a pretty good case. The DS goes on the bottom under 2 straps and above are two fairly large mesh pockets for games and accessories. I was able to store the ac adapter in one pocket and put two games in another pocket. I think that both pockets store maybe 4 games each. There are no outside pockets, so although this case is better then the ds safe case, it could have been better. Still at 4 stars, you can't go wrong with this case."
1,Sad chime,While the clock looks nice and keeps time correctly the chime is tinny and unpleasantAnd possibly the most doleful sound I have ever heard. I wish I had taken the time to return it.
1,I beg to differ...,"Well, I certainly am in the minority, but then again I have high standards with respect to such enormously talented individuals as Tony and K.D. They, as well as Louis Armstrong, whose music was to be celebrated on this album, have been done a disservice here. The orchestration is languorous to the point of being soporific. There isn't a trumpet to be heard (roll over, Satchmo!), and not one song conveys the rollicking spirit of the man who to whom they are paying tribute. K.D.'s voice is so rich and multilayered, but Tony's has begun to suffer from the changes in timbre that come with age. More artful production values characteristic of someone like Quincy Jones would have enabled a more elegant meshing of these veteran voices, with richer arrangements. Sorry for you diehard fans, but these two deserved something better than the flat landscape of this production."
1,Price hike makes this not worth it.,"I like the kindle edition of the NY Times, I really do. I get it whether I'm at home or on vacation, I don't have a lot of papers lying around the kitchen taking up space, and I can take it with me on mass transit without lugging something huge around. And I love reading this sort of medium-length content on my kindle screen.BUT...the price hike (from thirteen ninety-nine to nineteen ninety-nine) makes the price way too high, especially for something I can read on my iphone for free. It's not quite as nice an experience, but the difference isn't worth 19.99. I might subscribe to a cheaper local paper, though...sigh. I want to have the NY Times, but it's just not worth it. I have a feeling that the NY Times is just trying to kill off electronic editions, to preserve the paper edition. Good luck with that..."
1,won't set nails,"Nailer won't set nails below surface of wood. Maybe it would in soft woods such as pine, but it won't get the job done in hardwoods. It does not have a depth adjustment. Such thin nails do not set easily with a punch and you wind up with bigger hole than if you used 18 ga. This gun has been useless for me; think I will see what I can get for it at a pawn shop and get a Senco."
2,Suunto X6,This product work great. I would definitely purchase it again. The only concern I have with it is the glass face is very exposed to hitting anything. So far it hasn't been prone to scratching. I put the first and only scratch in the glass within the first week of ownership. I have had the watch almost 4 months now and I have not put any more scratches in it but I am more careful. Other than that the watch work perfectly. I am very pleased.
2,Beautiful illustrations and timeless stories,"I took a chance when I bought this book. I like hardcover books with beautiful illustrations and this definitely meets both criteria. I grew up with Birbal stories and they have a very fond place in my heart. He is the clever court council whom the evil ministers are trying to get rid of, but with his wit, he manages, not only to foil their attempts, but also impress Akbar the king with his clever mind. The stories are just like I remember them, but what makes this book priceless is the illustrations. I believe pictures help us transport ourselves into the time in which the stories are set and the stories remain with us through our lives. I am sure my son will love this book as much as I have."
1,Well... OK,"This is not a bad camera, so please don't be mislead by my review. For anyone who wants a [non expensive] camera that works, nothing beyond that, this could be the camera for you. If you plan on taking the camera everywhere, this is fine. If you want to be a serious photographer, however, don't even consider this one. Liek I said, it will take pictures just fine, it isn't a single-use camera, and it doesn't touch anything else beyond that. I hope this product review has been helpful to you."
2,Fujifilm 1 GB,I enjoyed The product. It was of good quality. I have no issues with the product at all. Thanks You
2,Do the job very well,These barstools are an excellent value for the price! Easy to set up and they sit very well. We have them for 4 weeks now and use them a lot.
1,The hustle is on...,I go along with the other disgruntled reviewers who paid for the first three seasons only to be sandbagged with this box set. This is an opitional purchase that I will never make.
2,Love this stuff,Works great for repairing soles that start to come apart. It is very durable and extends the life of shoes that need minor repairs. Highly Recommend
1,TERRIBLE!,"As an older teen, I am sure that I am less conservative than most parents, but I am still strongly against Kidz Bop for creating their remake of mostly inappropriate songs for kids. While I personally listen to a lot of these songs, I wouldn't have my child listen to them while Kidz Bop tries to pass itself off as something fun and child-friendly. Many of them have obvious sexual messages (sung by children, which i find disturbing) and themes that young children shouldn't have to deal with. From an teen's perspective, Kidz Bop has effectively ruined many songs for me; Every time I hear them sing on commercials I cringe. Kids should listen to their own age-appropriate songs. Just because kids are singing them doesn't make this okay for kids. Think about the bad influence of some pop music which regularly deals with drugs, sex, breakups etc. Do you want your five year old, completely unaware of what it's about, to sing along to this stuff?"
1,BEHEMOTH TOASTER---BE PREPARED,NO DOUBT YOU HAVE READ ALL THE TECHNICAL REVIEWS.ACTUAL USE IS THAT IT IS A VERY FAST HOT TOASTER. YOU WILL BE PLEASED WITH THE TIME IT TAKES TO TOAST ANYTHING.HOWEVER IT TOASTS UNEVENLY.THE INITIAL PICTURES APPEARED THAT IT IS A UNIQUE DESIGN BUT MANAGEABLE SIZE. BUT THE PINK ELEPHANT IS THAT IT IS HUGE AND APPEARS TO OVERTAKE ALL OTHER APPLIANCES IN THE KITCHEN.YOU MAY HAVE NIGHTMARES OF THIS GARGANTUAN 4 SLICER. IT SCARES ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO THE KITCHEN. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENTERED INTO THE TWILIGHT ZONE.
2,MIO GPS,So far I'm very satisfied with this product. I have yet to experience the full capabilities.
2,shop and maintenance reference,"I manage a crew of maintenance techs. who do not have a high level of mechanical experience. I have provide each man with his own guide. I have made it manditory reading as part of my ""continuous improvement program"" because of the practical and accurate mechanical information that it contains.I would prefer to see a larger sized book with larger print, but this is fine if you have sharp young eyes."
1,Let's be analytical about this...,"Ok, let's be cool. SOme say ""RELOAD"" is different, is music, is new. Fine.But have you ever listen to ""Ride the Lightning""? or ""Master of Puppets""?, or ""And Justice for All""? They changed in the Black album, but changed qwith quality. Now, they changed for the sake of nothing. They're gone."
1,Brave,"Just BluRay? Sounds a lot like ""records"", ""tapes"", then ""cd's"". I'm just not buying it. Why the same run around?"
1,QUE GUNS N ROSES NI QUE NADA!!!!,"ESTE ES EL DISCO FAVORITO DE MI PERRO,VALE LA PENA ADQUIRIRLO ES UNA BUENA INVERSION"
2,Grand Achievement...,"It is a great compilation and it takes you through various episodes of the Painters life. Simon Schama, takes you in deep on the implications of their work and finally pulls you to the master pieces of each of the Artists. If you're not an expert in Art History, but interested in acquiring more insight, this will surely put you on the next level."
1,"Nice design, but...","The features are all that most people need. Convenience factor is excellent. Sadly, the sound quality on the phone is poor, very noisy, and this a constant irritation. I moved finally to a much quieter Panasonic model. I find it strange that such a good design in terms of features would have a fatal flaw in its operation. My advice: look elsewhere."
1,Less than expected,"I enjoyed seeing the different plans and found some that might work for our family. I did not think the book was worth anywhere near the price charged, for there was really only 40 different plans, NOT 80 as noted in the book description. The book was 40 plans which were simply flip-flopped or reversed on the opposite page. I don't like mis-representation therefore I do not reccommend this book, unless you can find a used one."
1,Interesting book but tedious and dated,"first the good: Ms Hamilton is very knowledgeable on the subject and provides a great deal of connection between the Classical Greek and modern thought. The book contains a great deal of food for thought.Now the bad. First, I don't really care for the writing style. This is however a fairly minor issue compared to a bigger issue: bad comparisons.You can't compare a good translation of Classical Greek (such as Pindar) in Modern English and say how contemporary something sounds. Of course it sounds contemporary, if the translator was any good... In fact, Pindar and Homer composed works which would be, on the whole, very different from what people write today. The focus on similarities, especially in translation, is quite misleading.On the whole, I think some people would get something out of this book, but I think there are far better works which address both similarities and differences."
2,Clears up misconceptions,"This book gives a full picture of a geisha's life from the beginning of a career until the end and shows the ups and downs. Mineko Iwasaki tells an interesting story of an exotic life, one that is commonly misconstrued in the west. Sometimes its difficult to keep track of all the Japanese names, because they all sound and look the same to me! Otherwise, a nice book! Enjoy."
1,Not worth your time...,"Unfortunately this is a terrible film. The production values are certainly at ""B"" movie levels and the acting led to little comfort too. This film is not worthy of your time commitment."
1,Very elementary,"I was very disappointed. This book contained only the most basic information, and I did not find it to be helpful at all. It does not live up to it's title."
1,BloodTies,"Don't bother with this at all. I got so bored and underwhelmed with this series, I stopped watching it."
2,A Great Watch,This is a very comfortable watch-not too big-not too heavy. The face shines in the dark- a convenient feature. I bought it for my husband specifically for the beach and going into the water but now he wears it all the time. It is functioning perfectly. The band is very comfortable but tends to overlap too much on the wrist and gets caught on city clothing. Citizen could have made a shorter band. For quality and price you can't beat this watch. My husband is completely satisfied and loves it.
1,Waste of money,Buy the actual book - this pamphlet is a chapter within the book. I think it is just a single chapter out of the book.
1,Only if you have the time to wait for it to warm up....,"Very disappointed with this oven. I thought that I could work in the time that it takes for it to warm up into my breakfast routine, but it took about 7 minutes for it to get to temperature. Putting bread in any earlier makes warm bread, not toast. Once warm it works very well and if I were using it solely as an oven, I wouldn't have any complaints, but when I was looking to make a purchase, I searched for ""toaster oven"" and this came up. I made the purchase, even thought I read the reviews warning about this product mainly because the handle and finish matches perfectly my Kenmore elite appliances.I am also disappointed because for $130 I would expect a little engineering to go into the slideout tray, either in the form of a hook that pulls the tray out when the door opens, or some kind of catch that keeps it from falling on the door when it is pulled out."
1,I never received the Aloe juice. I have called and no response from anyone.,I never received the Aloe juice. I email you and call the company. I have not heard from anyone. It was to be shipped the end of January. I am disappointed from my dealings with everyone involved.
2,Still has the magic,"While not as stellar as Shrek 1 and 2, 3 is still certainly funny and cute (and beats Pirates 3)! I loved seeing all the little ogrelings."
1,Captive,"One word - AWEFUL. So aweful in fact that having forced myself to watch the entire film I then threw it in the trash. The one thing that could have really shone in this dire film was Oliver Reeds performance, who had so little screen time, that he may have not have bothered to have been featured at all. Poor guy. Other than the good grace of Oliver Reed's brief presence, it had a pointless plot, useless acting; poor film quality and a non-sensical ending. A waste of time and money."
1,Fun game,This works fine on my XP computer but the color of pawns mess up a little bit so you sometimes can't see them on the board only only half of a pawn is showing but the game still runs great and all the pawns talk and do their own antics as they move to another space or leave their start or when they head home or into the safe zone.
1,No drivers for Windows 7 or Vista,"My mistake in assuming they would be up to date with their drivers.From their own website:Is Kensington planning to release Mouseworks software compatible with Microsoft Vista or Windows 7?AnswerThere are no plans to do so at this time. It is important to know that you should not install Mouseworks on any PC running Microsoft Windows Vista or Windows 7. Mouseworks was exclusively developed to run under Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows. The Control Panel for Vista and Windows 7 does incorporate some options for input device configuration such as pointer speed adjustment, scrolling speed, and left/right button switch, however Mouseworks functionality such as button programming, fine tuning of acceleration et cetera are not supported."
1,Wish it would work in cold weather,"I have yet to get this camera to record below about 40 degrees. When I turn on video record mode, it turns itself off almost immediately, presumably because of low battery power. I makes great recordings in my living room, but not outside. Hopefully it will be better in the summer."
2,Seagate FreeAgent 250GB-External Hard Drive,"Simple, Quiet, Reasonably fast and a great product for the price. Very easy to back-up all of your information. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. The design of the unit also looks great!"
2,Good Value for the Price,"The HP Deskjet 6620 is a great little printer (actually it is not that LITTLE, it is quite wide)for the price. Speedy! And the print quality is good. I have not tried color, though. I like the status icons on the front, but do wish there was a USB hookup on the front as well as the back. But, for the price, you can't beat it."
2,Grandma's Gift To Me,"Grandma bought this for me over a year ago. She passed 6-2-10. The battery went dead two months ago and I installed a new one at a jewlery store. It was bigger than I thought. I should've measured it out before the purchase was made. But, it's a very nice watch and I have no regrets. I love you Grandma and I thank you for this priceless gift."
2,The great Karloff's groundbreaking monster debut,"This the second of Universals horror cycle after the previous success of ""Dracula"" the studio hit the jackpot with their adaption of Mary Shelleys Frankenstein and is the closest to the novel not in storyline but in what the novel says. Karloff portrays the Monster not as a maniacal beast but as a misunderstood creation. Colin Clive is not the madman portayed in later films but a perfectly sane scientist searching for the meaning of life. James Whale made his mark with this film and it is far superior to "" Dracula"" makes one wonder what Whale could have made of ""Dracula"" had he been signed as director instead of silent filmaker Tod Browning. This film is only surpassed by its excellent sequel ""Bride"" but its influence is still felt today. It launched the great Boris Karloff and James Whale and will remain the classic interpretation of the gothic chiller."
2,Fun - a couple hours curled up on the couch,"OK, so she's never going to win the Orange Prize, but MC Beaton succeeds in creating an intriguing, clever and barbed protagonist who I look forward to meeting again in following novels. Yes, this is a crowded and sometimes cutsey genre, but I enjoyed Agatha Raisin more than some other attempts. The ""mystery"" was hardly a difficult one to figure out, but it was fun to see how the characters developed as the details came together. I will skip through this series, probably an hour or so per book. Great for lazy afternoons or an indulgent hour before bed."
2,Unlike Anyone Else Actually,"I disagree that Jack Scott sounded like any other singer of his time unless you can count the moody Leonard Cohen. I remember his consistent hits and found ""Burning Bridges"", ""My True Love"" and others to be much more substantial than the teenybopper favorites (Frankie Avalon, Fabian, etc). But I got the impression even at my tender years that Scott (born Giovanni Safone, Jr, in Canada) was like one of those coffeehouse artists who come out, perform their music and exit the stage without taking a bow. I have no memory of ever seeing his picture anywhere in the teen culture; it was if he were a ""grown-up"" and everybody else was a kid--it even made me a little uneasy to think that. But his records were popular (while they lasted), then music changed as it often does. Jack's best work, I believe, is right here. No need to lament; he made his mark. Enjoy."

1,Did Not arrive yet.,"Sadly I can not give a helpful review on this because it is now 9 days past the last day of the estimated arrival date and the book is still not here. When a package has a 16 day arrival window I anticipate it getting to the destination in that time period. I was wrong. I am sure I would like the book since it is for a class, but I am now considering withdrawing from that class due to not having the required materials."
2,Kinda Corny but entertaining,"I liked all of the characters in the movie and it was a decent story line, some of the things were just a little far fetched for me."
2,Christmas Present,I bought this coffee pot for my daughter as a christmas/birthday present. She wanted it because they had one at work and loved it. She said the one I got her was even nicer then the one at work.
1,Works but EATS batteries!!,"I bought this remote several months ago and it works as advertised and was easy to setup and use. One complaint I have about is it EATS batteries when not in use. The batteries that came with it were dead within a couple of weeks. I purchased more and they too went dead in a couple of weeks. I don't use it all that often and store it in the receiver as shown in the pictures. Emails for support request to the manufacturer went un-answered. So, all in all, I would say stay away from this item. Not worth the money wasted on changing the batteries in the remote."
2,Worth Every Penny,"I bought this to hook the Mac Mini up to our TV as a HTPC/server. Now, I'm glad that I did, since it allows our old TV to display any video that it has. Would recommend this to anyone that can use it. It's worth every penny."
2,very good,"Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It is definatly worth looking at the extra discs, as they have tons of stuff on the making of the movie. Great to own or rent!"
1,THIS WAS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"Her last album, ""21 Ways to Grow"", which is now out of print, was way better than this sorry attempt at a comeback. The only 3 songs worth listening to are the first 3 cuts on the album. I am so sorry that I ran out and bought this much anticipated album. Shanice is very talented, but once again, the type of material she has been given or that she has chosen DOES NOT reflect her true talent and musical abilities. Shanice wrote the song ""I Love You"" for Keith Washington's most recent album (he sang duet with Chante Moore) and even that was more the style of music you come to associate with Shanice, not these thrown together half-grooves on her current album."
1,Pure Junk,This weeder is junk! I used it to remove dandelions from my garden and it quickly began to bend under nominal stress. I tried to bend it back but it quickly became impossible to use. My wife bought another similar product designed for hand use. It remains unbent after years of vigorous use. I bought this to avoid working on my knees. It is a pure waste of money. The True Temper designation is bogus.
2,Chock Full of Info!,"This book is one of the best I have read so far. The author lists lots of how to tips for all phases of the invention process. I, like another reviewer of this book, only wish the author had an e mail address so I could communicate with him. I really learned somethings that I could DO from this book. (some supposedly how-to books only tell how the author did it! ) This book helps to end some of the frustration that arises from having a great product--and not knowing where to go with it! Thanks"
1,Not for me; your mileage may vary!,"Due to budgetary constraints, I had to find a cheaper night cream. I'm 43 with combo, slightly sensitive skin that's blackhead-prone and subject to the occasional pimple. For the most part I only need night cream in the wintertime. This feels lovely going on (soothing, silky texture); it's non-irritating (to me) and unscented. However, whether I apply a lot or a little, I wake up with extremely greasy skin that still feels somewhat dry and parched underneath, and the blackheads are worse. I'm guessing that sesame oil doesn't agree with me. It's hit or miss with natural oils--my face loves avocado and almond oils but olive and soybean oils make me break out. Your mileage may vary!I will be using this up on my neck and decollete, where it works beautifully--lovely glow and no greasiness--though n.b., I detect a slight scent of sesame oil under my turtlenecks and recommend you don't apply this under silk and dry-cleanables."
2,MURS GOT IT LOCKED AGAIN BUT ALMOST A CLASSIC,THIS DISC IS Almost a CLASSIC.THE ONLY THING TRULY MISSING IS JUST THAT MORE DYNAMIC LYRICISM THAT WE'D HEARD ON MURS 3:16 AND I STILL THINK MURS IS ONE OF THE MORE PERFECT COLLABORATORS FOR 9TH WONDER AND THAT AMAZING CHEMESTRY DOES USUALLY TRANSLATE INTO FIRE BUT SOME LACK LUSTER TRACKS SUCH AS MURRAY REVENGE(THE TITLE TRACK) IS A LIL WEAK ON LYRICS BUT ALL OF 9TH'S PRODUCTION IS STEALLER.NUFF SAID
1,"poorly made & designed, not as advertised","The specifications for this item list it as a 25 watt lamp that does NOT need or use batteries. In other words, an AC house current item. Not so. It requires 3 batteries. Still,I NEEDED something that used AC. Even then, I had problems opening the battery compartment. Eventually I discovered that I needed to unscrew a tiny phillips screw with a jeweler's screwdriver before I could remove the battery compartment lid. When the batteries were installed, I had to re-screw the phillips screw to keep the cover from falling out. Actually, I just secured it with a piece of tape. The effect of the item when on, however, was quite pleasant."
2,Awesome book!,"If you've ever wondered about the power and truth of the Eucharist as taught by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, you should read this book. It talks briefly about what these churches believe about the Body and Blood of Jesus in the Eucharist and then gives several examples of miracles that have happened regarding this phenomenon. Also, it talks about many saints, their devotion to the Eucharist, and miracles that have been attributed to them related to the Eucharist.If you have a scientific mind that causes you to doubt religion or the existence of God in general, this book would be great to read because in many of the examples, the author details how the miracle was studied and tested by doctors and scientists to varify if there was any other possible explanation for what happened. I think it's also good food for thought for atheists and agnostics. This book can definitely be a faith booster!"
1,Shoddy Scholarship,"Dave, You should have listened to those who tried to correct your galleys for you before you took this to press. I cannot find a single page in this book that doesn't have a stupid remark or downright untruth. Sorry Dave, but you really put your reputation on the line with this book."
1,Works great for five minutes.,"I thought it would be a neat idea to hang christmas lights around my room. I had a set of 100 lights and used about ten or so clips to keep them hanging. As I was hanging them up there, some kept falling off so I put a new sticky on the back to make it work again. After awhile I got them all up there and it looked wonderful. The concept of these clips is great! However, the adhesive is not strong enough. May work for small projects but as much as I tried keeping them up there, I gave up. Very scary when they fall down while you're sleeping. Will be returning these back."
2,Good Quality,I am not much of a 5 star person yet maybe this should. The RAM has been in the computer for a month running 24 hours with no problems.

2,A Must For Your DVD Collection,"A few months ago when I watched that wonderful Number Ones TV Special program, I became greatly attacted by those wonderful words spoken by those Pop celebrities as well as those amazing footage of videos and live performance! Michael Jackson is truely the greatest, forever and for always!I Strongly wish all his videos appeared in 1980s could be released as DVD format!"
2,Great item - but . . .,"I have been reloading for over a year now. Approximately 6 months ago I began reloading 223 ammunition and seen that it required 26.5 grains of powder, more than a single disk can measure. After reading up on different loads (using Winchester 741 powder) I began loading & testing. The assembly worked like a champ, except - the unit drops powder continuously. After loading 100 rounds, I brushed off almost 20 grains of powder from my reloading bench. I think it is a bit excessive and have contacted LEE Precision for any information they may have for fixing or possibly reducing the amount of powder being sprinkled. It works very well, but be ready to brush up excessive powder being sprinkled during reloading!"
1,Worthless and tasteless,"I am so sorry I bought this recording. A clerk in a store on Brighton Beach told me that it was some excellent techno, so I believed him and wasted $15 on this worthless record. Tasteless lyrics and unprofessional mixing are enough to give you a headache after 10 minutes of listening. Remixes at the end of the record are make otherwise terrible music even worse. Artists obviously made an attempt to clone the music of European stars, such as ""Masterboy"" or ""Mr. President"", rather than trying to come up with their own musical ideas. The album ends with a ballad, ""Best Friends"", which once again proves that the creators of the album lack one main quality, which is required from an artist to write good music - professionalism. Perhaps next time they should also invite a good designer to work on the cover as well. I want my $15 back, you plagiarsts!"
2,"celine dion, a new day","product was great. Amazon sent two copies and charged me for two, I only clicked on one. Is this a new way of making money? I kept the second copy so I guess Amazon's mistake worked, huh? Will think again about ordering from Amazon, as this was the second time this has happened."
1,Kind of cheap.,"The material for this costume is cheap. I don't expect the highest quality from a costume, so I wasn't too surprised. The hat is cute, but the antlers don't stand up well."
1,Product Old,"I ordered a big quantity of the body wash and was very disappointed, the product smells bad. I have been using this for over 2 years and it never had such an odd odor. The product smells old. Its so bad I cant use it. What a waste of money and shipping. Disappointed."
2,Good Program,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife. I use W2000Pro, so needed penultimate version. Shipment was very quick, product as advertised, easy install, excellent results..."
1,useless paper feeder,"I had high hopes for this attractive and portable printer, especially given HP's good reputation. But I was intensely disappointed when, after installing it on both a Dell and an Imac, with one single successful ""test page"" printout, it refused to work on either. Everytime I hit ""print"", the printer went wild: spitting out every piece of paper I fed it, without making a single mark on any of the paper. Impossible to correct. And then it turned out it was no longer under warranty and not returnable. A complete waste."

1,Breaks apart too easily,"I had about 4 of these cups at my house. At first I LOVED them. 2 weeks later my son dropped his from his car seat to the floor of the car and the lid exploded. One down. Next I was washing one BY HAND in sink and the bottom of the cup dropped off. I tried gluing it back on, no luck. It didn't look very safe without the bottom on it. Two down. Lid broke off the third one when my 5 year old pushed the open button a little hard. I have one cup left after having these Funtainers about 4 months.Yes, I have a contacted Thermos. NO warranty on the parts that broke and a replacement lid with shipping and everything is 7$. I got the cups at Target for 12$, so more than half of that for a lid that will probably break again. I will not be buying anymore thermos funtainers. They are too expensive to break so easily and with such little wear and tear. What a waste!"

I highly recommend this to people who have never been successful at yoga, Leslie is gentle and keeps encouraging you to give it time and to not be too hard on yourself. Flexibility will come. So Yoga? Me? you? YES!!!"
2,nice buy,"im very pleased with this product nice size holds everything i need. material breaths well,plus it looks good!! thanks !!"
1,Not Really Worth It,"I rate this low because of problems with drivers from this company who rarely updates them. This is a niche item from a boutique company that doesn't really make a whole lot of differance in actual performance.My experience is it fails to outperform any other 1 Gig card, and I've had problems with drivers when transitioning from Windows XP to Windows 7. Plus, it throws off a lot of heat that your pc may not be able to handle."
1,another thousand pages just got off of the train,"it is easy to read this book (unlike others by the author), but difficult to fathom why it was written, what it is in aid of, the plot, the characters, all looking for... what? who exactly is narrating it? there is an ""I"" but damned if he makes constant and coherent sense, symbolically (and there is a bit too much of this) or otherwise. there is so much ""research"" underpinning every sentence (voluminous notes to credit every burp) that no one or no action quite comes alive, everything buried beneath the author's attempt to appear ""learned,"" I guess. these are not real people one cares about in the least, even as they walk into gas chambers (again footnoted beyond belief). i have trouble understanding how this author manages year after year to turn out such long volumes. no writer can write so much and produce it so fast and have it be all that good. perhaps he should take more time on the next one."

1,a knitter in colorado,"At first, I was excited to find a knitting book with easy, modern designs. Then, once I made my first project, I realized her sizing was on the small side, even a large was too small, and I'm mot a large person.The smaller projects in the book are nice for gifts, but I would skip the sweaters. Also, many of the projects would be better suited to circular knitting. Know one wants to seam a hat that can be knit in a circle to begin with!Her directions are vague at times, and her finishing techniques don't really give a professional look. I find it hard to believe she finishes her own garments this way."
1,Unviewable DVD in some geographic zones,"The DVD is a UK import. We were not aware when we purchased it that it would have a copyright geographic zone block on it that would prevent it from playing in our US DVD player. There is probably some way around this block, but unless you're aware of how to do that, be careful buying this UK import."
2,ok but not what I expected,"The book itself is satisfactory and works for my needs. I think it is a must for any healing touch student who is considering certification. It contains useful applications, pictures and insight from B. Brennan. There are also a lot of inspiring stories from Brennan's work. However, I bough it second hand and I was disappointed to find writing in the book and some smudges when it was listed as very good condition with no mention of the markings...wished I'd bough it new since this is a keeper for frequent reference."
2,Amusing *and* intelligent,This book charmed me from the first page. Gavan and Priscilla's battle for love kept me smiling right along while the twists and turns kept me riveted. Highly recommended.
1,Lots of Plugs,"If you enjoy reading novels that plug lots of products and brand names, you will love this novel. The following products and brand names were plugged in this novel: Nike, Saran Wrap, Nextel, Coleman, Four Seasons Hotel, Dilly Bar, Panasonic, Visa, Batman, Cessna, Denny's, Dodge Ram, Texaco, Safeway, Breyers, IGA, Coke, HBO, CNN, Burgar King, Reebok, Citgo, Pepsi-Cola, Junior Mints, Sears, Subaru, Saturn, Cadillac, MG, Chevrolet, Google, Joe Boxers, Motorola, Slurpee, 7-11, Corvette, Twinkies, Altoids, and Doritos. (Not to mention: At least 15 major label recording artists were plugged.)Coleman received the most plugs (I counted 16).Nike was plugged at least 9 times. In my eyes, all these plugs cheapen the novel. I am curious to know how much money SK brought in through these plugs. And does he feel that it was worth it?"
2,An Excellent Anthology!,"This is an excellent collection of short fiction, which includes the work of Charles Bukowski who happens to be a favorite of mine! The other authors are also intriguing. Its a great collection and very entertaining! Something for everyone with any hint of a fetish to relate to and chuckle at."
2,pretty dam good!,"For my English Literature GCSE I had to read the book 'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck. I quite likeed the book, but my English teacher (Mr. B) also made us watch the film as he thought that it was a very good interpretation of the book. After watching it I completely agreed.The acting is great, especially John Malkovich, and if your doing this book in your exams kids then I definately recomend you watch the film. Trust me it helps!"
2,A hidden Classic,"I am a little disappointed in some of the reviews I have read about this record, in magazines, All music guide....especially all music guide. They missed the point of most of the songs. Tom has always been out spoken about corporate record companies, and the decline of rock radio. I think he tryed something different here and to my mind it worked....there are great riffs throughout the record and some of his best ballads ever. Now this semi-concept CD will not be for everbody...so they can rate it a 3....but trust me this is a hidden gem...go back and really listen and throw out all preconceptions and get to what Tom was trying to say....not what YOU think he should have said."
2,two superlative albums on one cd,"what can i say about this disc? How 'bout this: if the only cuts here were the ones we've all heard before, ie People Get Ready, Keep on Pushing, Amen, I've Been Trying, et al, it would, of course, be a must have. But, just for a moment, forget about those classics, and realize you're getting stuff here you are probably going to be hearing for the first time. And let me say, you'll be in heaven...Long Long Winter, I Thank Heaven, I've Found That I've Lost, Hard to Believe, and See the Real Me. If only there were someone around these days who could make music one one-hundredth this enjoyable."
2,A must have for the travel enthusiast,My ultimate dream is to take a year and travel the world. I was enthralled when I viewed this dvd. It is like having three dvds in one. All of the classical places on earth that a true travel enthusiast wants to visit are included in this dvd. It does not disappoint with it's incredible scenery and photography. I felt I was actually there. A must have!
1,MBT,"My first B9180 lasted about two weeks before sending a message saying ""Service Stall"". It never recovered and was replaced under warranty. My second B9180 lasted almost a month before sending the same message. It too was replaced under warranty. My 3rd B9180 lasted one year and 5 days. It then began spitting yellow ink all over photos and the inside of the printer. It was out of warranty and will cost me about $300 for an exchange through HP.When the printer actually works, it does a great job on prints ranging in size from 4 x 6 to 13 x 19. But I've got to think that my run of bad luck with these printers is more than just coincidence. I'd look elsewhere for a photo printer."
2,it's alright,"Somewhere in a deep, dark corner of Amazon, reviewer number 158 writes:I personally like it; the lyrics are not all that intellegent, but the actual music kind of makes up for that. I'm guessing that like all pop singers, unfourtunately, that Lohan will become hopelessly corrupt, exactly like Spears or Avril or even Ashlee Simpson. But in the beginning start-up phase, singers like this are pretty good, but - speak for yourself."
2,Not Bad,"To start off, this is a great drum pad. I am 15 years old, and been drumming since 4th grade. I do have a full drum set, but this is PERFECT for rudiments, warming up, and practice. It is very quiet, but not silent. I have two sisters, and this gets 5 stars from them for noise! The bounce is very realistic, and feels great. I ordered the 12in pad, and it is small, but not too small. I love this product. Thanks! Hope this helped.--Matt"
1,I thought that Monsenieur Musk by Dana was big BIG RIPP OFF,I used the real Monsenieur Musk by Houbigant in the early 1980's.....thie stuff that is now made by DANA using their old name is a JOKE...it lasts about 30 seconds and smell like crap...what a ripp off.I'm gonna call amazon and see if I can send it back and get my money back!!!feel like I was really ripped off!
2,Titanic Tempest,"I first got hooked on Teen Titans when my best friend's father gave me some issues of The Titans. I really got interested when I heard that they were re-launching Teen Titans. One day, I was in a comic-book store and I found Teen Titans: A Kid's Game sitting on a shelf. I waged an internal debate as to whether or not I should buy it, and the side that wanted the collection won. So I bought it, and I haven't regretted it at all. I loved everything about this collection: the union of the new Teen Titans, the character development, and the unexpected twists. If you ever see this collection, buy it! Don't take my word for it; buy it and read it for yourself."
1,BEWARE - ITEM NOT MALIBU 2000,"The items shipped were not Malibu-2000 as stated and indicated on the invoice. Items were ""Malibu"" an entirely different and arguably inferior product."
1,.... HYBRID CD is a joke !!,...The surround sound on this disc in non-existent. There is NO center channel on the multi channel layer. If you are serious about multi channel recordings this is the worst ... This label should be ashamed of itself to mislead the public into thinking this is some kind of new level in recorded music. ...
1,Lava Lamp,"I have always been very pleased with the products that I receive from Amazon. Unfortunately, I am very unhappy with the Lava Lamp, Lava Lite Black/Clear lamp. It had residual black smudges all through the lamp. It was very disappointing and it is all on the inside so there is no way to try to clean it up. Heating it up was no help, so it was basically a waste of money."
2,W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L!!!!!,i can't say anything about this album because it's such a great album i've ever listened before.Briefly magnificent album from our great man J.T and amazing group Kool &The Gang.what can i say anything?why are you waiting for?purchase it!!!!
2,Much more interesting than I had thought it would be.,"Bullion tells the story of the 1983 robbery at the Brinks-Mat warehouse near Heathrow, in which 26 million pounds of gold bullion was stolen. Three investigative journalists (Andrew Hogg, Jim McDougall and Robin Morgan) examine not only the crime itself, but the roots that the crime and its aftermath had in both British and American organized crime.I picked this book up when I had literally nothing else to read. I was not expecting very much. In the past, I have found True Crime books that I have read to be shoddily researched, overly shocking, or heavily biased and I have not enjoyed them. Bullion is a pleasant surprise in that it seems more concerned with facts than either sensationalist aspects or pushing a particular agenda. The research that the three have done feels complete, and they do a good job of detangling the connections so that the story is understandable to the average reader."
2,Excellent new single.,"This is the second new single from DJ Shadow and recently hit number one on Billboard 's Top 12""/Maxi single sales chart. Otherwise I wouldn't have bought it because I don't know much about the artist so his music is new to me. The first track is the remix and with more guitars and hip hop elements and the rap of Mos Def--- the mix is only(3:51) but very intesesting. The Radio Edit(3:38) and Album Instrumental (4:59) are more trip hop in feel. The best song is the track ""100 Metre Dash"" which combines elements of drum & bass with actual live jazz elements like the drums pattern. The fault is that there should have been a second remixer to give the song a different vibe than just DJ Shadow. Very good."
2,"Great product, but be sure to change your eartips!","This is an absolutely great value and a surprisingly solid purchase. I bought this pack almost two years ago as a backup, since it's so nicely organized and accessible. The sphygmomanometer works great (although I wish the tubing for the bulb was shorter). The acoustics on the Omron Sprague Rappaport stethoscope are also surprisingly good (please don't start comparing it to a Littmann, that's just ridiculous), for the price. However, the ear pieces are just plain terrible. They hurt my ears to the point that I can't even take auscultate for 10 seconds without having to switch back to my trusty Classic II. I recently changed the tips to a pair of soft spare ones that came with a Prestige brand scope. Now it seems to be a lot more comfortable and actually usable. The penlight is also pretty decent. All in all, a good purchase. Wish it came with a reflex hammer though, but hey.. it's great for what it's worth."
1,Minnie & Moo,Misleading advertising. Arrived as a small paperback the price of a hardbound. Extremely disappointed.
1,This product doesn't work!,"When it works, it's great, but so far we've tried to open six wine bottles, and four times this product pushed the cork down in the neck of the bottle rather than extracting the cork."
1,SLOW DOWN!,"If you love upbeat dancing, and already know how, this workout is for you. Actual out-of-shape beginners, beware! I couldn't even keep up with the warm-up. Both the warm-up and cool-down segments were about as fast as the actual workout! ""For beginners"" Ha!"
2,from a Venice lover,"I anxiously awaited this book because The Garden of Good & Evil was a blast and had such a wonderful flow. This one feels a little clumsier and contrived but since Venice is one of my favorite cities, it kept my interest. I'm giving it a four because I consider Berendt a fine writer but wish he had cooked up a jucier plot."
2,Maybe it was knowing what to expect,"Since I'd read the reviews and knew this book was about time travel and sci-fi, both of which interest me, I liked it. Granted there were a few loose ends but they were minor. The character of Knox caught on with me right away, Nikita took a bit longer."
1,Don't buy it,"I hate this cake carrier. The locks that hold it together come undone easily, allowing your cake to drop to the ground. Mine broke, and Tupperware did not replace it. Don't buy this."
2,Great popper,"I was wary of buying one of these machines, based on what I'd heard about popcorn poppers. This one really DOES work well! There are *very* few unpopped kernels, though they do sometimes get mixed in with the popped ones. I use a large bowl with it, but even so, I do get some spillage. It's also loud. I can live with all that.. My only real complaint is that the popcorn isn't really crisp, as it is with a traditional oil popper. Maybe that's just how it is with hot air poppers? I'm using Orville Redenbaucher kernels, by the way. I'm not sure that makes a difference. I still eat tons of it, knowing it's healthy and filling! If you need a hot air popcorn popper, this is the one to buy."
1,Truth for living,"This book confirmed my own belief on how a woman should care for her man, and in return he will meet all her needs. What could be more of a truth on giving then real life experiences. I highly recommend this book for all those who want a meaningful life."
1,Dull as toliet paper,"This is another tool imitation without the charm nor the artof it's band, the singer is no christina aguilera, rolling stone magazine call this one metal domination, there is absolutelynothing dominating about this band, the band is pointlessIf you want real metal, go pick up hammerfall, this is a failureof all points."
1,My Side of the Mountain,"I read this book for a school summer project. I would have to say that I have read better. I think that the way this book was writen was great, but all together I found the story and it's events boring and repetitive."
2,Outstanding,"This is Klause Doldinger & Passport at their finest in my opinion. There are other guest appearances, they do a great version of ""Compared to What"" The sound on this live cd is superb. This & other cds by Passport at this time are all good. This is a good starting point & generally I am a purist & prefer studio versions. I was glad to find this & buy on Amazon to replace my worn out LP. This is one to snatch up. Thank You"
2,A superb read,"Amanda's Rib by Cyndia Depre combines a character study with an exciting plot. Her characters were so real to me that I'd find myself thinking about them when I was doing chores around the house or going somewhere in my car. Ms. Depre, a first-time published author, has a very appealing writing style that makes the reader want to keep on reading. The main character, Amanda Winslow, has secrets that keep her from trusting others, especially men, but Jack Lindsey, a friend of a friend, keeps on trying to get close to her. Find a comfortable place to sit and read Amanda's Rib. The ending will knock you out of your chair!"
1,Long,"In the grand scheme of all books, Shadowfires does not rate a 1 star. But in comparison to Dean's other books, it is worthy of only 1 star (and maybe no stars). As others have mentioned, the leads are cookie cutter. Too many bad guys - Eric the ex, his business partners, the government agent chasing the leads. And the business partners storyline, which could have provided the most suspense, was wrapped up tight much too early in the book and with no satisfaction to the reader. This felt like the book editor told Dean to drop the business partners angle. But sadly the editor missed the mark - all of the details should have been edited instead.I highly recommend Dean, but avoid this book. Try Strangers instead."
2,Almost as Good as Being at the Gym!,I love this video. I like to do aerobox at the gym but sometimes I miss a session or two. This video keeps me going. It has a great routine -- very challenging. I like the guy who leads the routine. It's easy to follow and has great coreography and even a challenging skipping routine. A fantastic cardio workout. I love the Kathy Smith series!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!,"Folks, research the web. All Samsung TV's last about 2 years and then all have the same problems of dots on the screen and the TV turning on and off by itself and most times not turning on at all. Blue screens, black screens, this TV is designed to break down. And Samsung and warranties are useless. Samsung tech support is rude, careless and designed to NOT help you with your problem. If you want to throw your money away, buy a Samsung! Just read the thousands of the same complaints on the web!"
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this SHM-cd thinking it would at least sound a little better than the original one! Unless you need a special Shm-cd player, this release on a normal player doesn't sound any different from the domestic one. Usually Japanese releases sound better, but not here. This album needs a remastered job real bad!"
2,amusing family film,"The difference between comedies of the past and ""family"" movies of today is their ability to be good entertainment for everyone w/o being hokey. Bud and Lou are in fine form in this, one of their last films. Everyone will enjoy this wonderfully funny film. Look for the ""Take Your Pick"" bit, one of those classic Abbott and Costello routines."
1,Sigh,Typical teen movie. The only real excitement was the little nudity. But even then you can save some time and go watch something else like short bus.
2,The BEST!!!!,"I dont know what the others are talking about!!! I recieved this as a gift about 10 years ago, the only reason I dont still have it is because someone stole it about 3 years ago. I have been looking for this exact one ever since!!! So glad I finally found it again!!! This is the BEST cd shower radio ever!!! Got it really wet often with out any problems, gets great reception, quality of sound is great,batteries last a very long time and I used it everyday! Great for taking to the beach also! Total win! Can't wait for it to arrive so I can start using it again! I have bought others over the last few years and they all were terrible... THIS IS THE ONE!!! Thanks :)"
2,Intelligent book,"I am not a student of philosophy and this is my first book to read by the author. Naturally, I didnt find the book an easy read, but I can't blame the author since Im on unfamiliar territory. However, I really enjoyed reading the book and its amazing how many phrases are worth memorizing. The book is very original and very intelligent. From what I read Nietzsche is against organised religion, so I thought it was quite strange that he chose a Prophet to deliver this thoughts to us."
1,"Great customer service,.. lousy product","Initially the motor didn't work and was replaced free of charge. I went to pick it up outside of Boston at their company and was pleased to meet very friendly, helpful people. Unfortunately the product itself is not worth your time. The parts have broken over and over again. I was going to once again order more parts but after realizing I would have to nearly replace the entire thing I'm instead going to order a leaf vacuum/mulcher which will end up costing less."
2,dc talk live,"all the song on this album are a winner like ""like it, love it, need it"",""colored people"" and ""what if i stumble"". this cd is a must have if you're a big dc talk fan."
2,Spiderman,"This was a great superhero movie. Peter Parker is kind of the dorky kid in class. They go on a science field trip and look at the different species of spiders. One got out, but nobody knew. As they're looking at another spider, the one that got loose, climbs down and bites peters hand. After this he discovers he can shoot webs out of his wrist. He lives the life of being a superhero and protects the city from the green goblin. Spidey comes out to be the ""bad"" news of the city when he really is the good guy. He has to live 2 worlds living as a superhero, and living the life of peter parker where he has a crush on mary jane and his new job at a local newspaper company."
1,COBY DVD-237 Player IS NOT Region Free,"STOP and BEWARE. If you want to purchase a multi-region DVD player DO NOT buy the Coby DVD-237 DVD player it is just a regular DVD player. I wanted a multi-region player that I could watch DVD's from England on (Region 2). I read the reviews and other people wrote about how easy this player was to do it, so I ordered it. Well I got the player yesterday, and the player DOES NOT do multi-regions. It may be a fine little player, but it is not what it is advertised as, now I have to return it. You can contact Coby Customer Service at 1-800-681-2629 and they can tell you what the player can and can't do. But it does not do Regions outside the US."
1,The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis,"In my perspective of reading The Screwtape Letters, I found the book being very repetitive to the point where it took the excitement away from the book. Don't get me wrong the book dealt with many social issues that we as individuals undergo each and everyday of our lives. Just because I wasn't overly excited with The Screwtape Letters shouldn't hender one from reading this book. On the other hand, reading The Screwtape Letters could encourage or help someone through their troubling times."
2,Very Satisfied with Quality and price,"This item was described as used. It was packed very well, in a box appropriate in size for this small piece. It was in almost new condition. Works great."
2,Is the closest to the book that i've found.,"The movie is the closest to the book that i have found. The beginning is completly different from the book, and they cut out a couple parts. For example the lion and the unicorn scene, which is my personal favorite, did not exist in the movie. And the part with the white knight was also extremely close to the part in the book, but it was so BORING...it just makes you wait for the movie to get over, and in my mind bogs down the movie. But other than that i would recommend this to anyone who is a die hard for the Alice in Wonderland series."
1,Not for me.,"I ended up returning this. The bra, in my opinion, makes your breasst look ""torpido-ish"". It also has this loose fabric that hangs of the bra that makes your clothes look frumpy. Just wasn't very impressed. However, Amazon was speedy with my refund! :)"
2,Another hit from Denise,"If you are a beginner or intermediate exerciser you will find this DVD challenging and fun. The Low Impact Workout gets your heart pumping with power walking and simple and fun routines that target the whole body. At the end of the segment you are feeling invigorated and ready to face the day. The Stretch & Tone segment Denise incorporates stretching, ballet, pilates, and yoga. It is a perfect routine to do at the end of the day."
2,Good CD,"I like this one a lot better than their first but would probably chop 5 songs. This leaves them with 11 good ones which is the average total of songs on a CD!!! The songs that are good are ""Really Good""! I can get by the weak ones and still give it 4 stars.Is it just me or does Ozzy sound kinda bad on ""Shock The Monkey?"" Anyways if you are a fan of the first one you might be disappointed...it all depends on your willingness to accept change."
2,too long,"this author definitely has talent; his writing is exceptional; only problem with this particular book is that it is too long; in my opinion, about 100 pages could have been taken out of this and the story would have been just as good."
2,Sam is the man...,"I have loved this guy's voice and phrasing since I first watched him on Star Search. (Remember that show?) Ginormous voice and range, and just plain gorgeous on the ears. I originally had LPs, which were replaced with CDs that were lost in numerous moves. Good to have him back on my car's speakers."
2,Serbian and Yugoslav Mauser Rifles,"An easy read, well laid out and infomative. Lots of info on markings and serial numbers. A nice beief history also. Overall a great book for the novice or the collector. I made my money back on the first Yugo M 1924 carbine I bought. Thanks Branko!"
1,Sony ICD-SX57DR9 Digital Voice Recorder,"This model Sony comes either by itself for about $129, or $169 with docking station, recharable NiM batts.and Dragan Naturally ver. 9 speach to text SW. The Recorder is beutifully made, very small and records good quality Sony MSV files. However, both SW packages it comes with are a nightmare. I spent over 4 hours of personal time and an additioanl 1.5 hours with Sony technical support and NEVER got the Sony Digtial Voice SW to run properly. I tried it on two different Windows XP Computers. They do have a version for Vista now, you can download it from Sony (Ver. 3.1) However, neither 3.0 or 3.1 SW could run properly on my computers. I returned the unit in frustration. May try an Olympus, or just get a good o'l tape unit."
1,Not quite the Irish Tenors,I also bought this thinking it was the Irish Tenors and feel [like I was taken]. They are the same songs only the voices are thin and lacking in quality and style. The only thing that I liked about this CD was that the arrangements were simple and in keeping with the music. Otherwise poor quality.
2,Santa;s Magical Stories,We just loved these Christmas classics! They never get old or tired. It is wonderful to share these with the grandchildren.
1,"Poorly written, poorly researched","Why do I keep wasting my money on books written by this author? I should have learned my lesson after buying his awful ""The Bell Tower"" (Jack the Ripper) and his even worse ""Zodiac Unmasked"" (Zodiac killer).Well, after reading ""Amerithrax"" with all of its factual inaccuracies and research blunders, Graysmith's writing career will have to be funded by someone else."
1,Find a better waste of time,"Not much to say here, John Morthland may aspire to be a rock critic on par with Greil Marcus, but when it comes down to it, he just comes across as bitter and incompetent, especially in the field of rock and roll."
1,Red Rabbit,"This book drones on and on and doesn't seem to make any point. After 200+ pages, I quit reading and put it away. Tom Clancy, you can do much better than this drivel."
2,Works very well,"like the product, does what it's suppose to do, can get a little messy with overspray, that is why i did not give it 5 stars...other than that small issue, I am happy with this item."
2,Awesome read for young adults,"This book is an awesome read for someone who is looking for action,adventure and humor. This book is amazing I recommend reading this book."
2,Interesting essays...,"This is a collection of essays about nine women who are known for their mystery and/or suspense writing. The subjects include Daphne du Maurier, Margery Allingham, Anne Morice, Dorothy Uhnak, Lillian O'Donnell, Craig Rice, E. X. Ferrars, Patricia Highsmith, and Shirley Jackson. I originally picked up the book for the Highsmith essay, but found several of the others informative. (I also found some of them tantalizing, when they mentioned stories or novels that I hadn't read yet. Be prepared to take notes before going book-hunting.)"
2,Great Memories,Love this CD. Lesley Gore was a fave of mine in the '60s and listening to her again brings back some great memories. Get the album...you will like it.
1,y did u have to desapoint us????,"sorry but this iz not wirth it!!! get some lyrics, beats r'nt that good either"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this watch 4 years ago. It is an atomic solar watch that is supposed to NEVER RUN OUT OF POWER. About 6 months ago the watch began to only charge to medium power and then would completely die after about 8 hours! Casio uses a cheap solar cell for these watches and will not admit to this problem or just replace the watch. Casio will make you either pay $90 for service fee to replace the solar cell or you just have to buy a new watch. This is false advertising and this watch is not worth the money. I suggest you buy a better watch with a battery. When the battery runs out after a few years it will only cost you about $10 to replace a battery. Casio should be ashamed of themselves, I have worn a G-shock of one type or another for almost 20 years, but this is blatantly false advertising and I will NEVER own another Casio product. Citizen makes a fine watch."
1,do NOT buy if you like to tent camp.,75% of the sites in this book allow RV camping. The title is extraordinarily misleading.
2,Pointer does what it is supposed to do,"I bought this and it still works several months later with no problems. Be AWARE of which one you buy...I bought this one from this HDE and it requires AAA batteries. I bought the one which ships from Hong Kong and it takes the special A23 battery. In the ""customers also viewed area"" it shows this product needing A23 batteries. Not sure if I lucked out on getting the AAA or if people are reviewing the wrong product.Would and did buy again as students have taken the clicker from me because of the red laser."
2,I like chicken.,I thought that Salem's Lot was an awesome book. I'd read it again and again if i had the chance. My favorite part is when they go into the house and find out he's not there. It's so cool! My favorite character is Mark because he's only 9 or 10 years old and he's smarter then most people in the town. If you like vampires and weird stuff then this book you'll love!
2,Dementor Child's Costume,"This costume is very nice and fits well (size 8-10). In person, the costume looks exactly how it looks online. I only gave the costume four stars b/c the mask is a bit flimsy and could rip rather easily. Overall, my son loves the costume!"
1,poor,"This album has a total of 11 songs. All of them are remixed with the crazy frog doing his annoying jingles in the background. This cd is for the very young (10 or younger). I, however, would much prefer the originals to these songs. Here are the original tracks and the artists:1. We Like To Party - Vengaboys2. Get Ready For This - 2 Unlimited3. I Like To Move It - M.C. Mario (originally called ""Move It"")4. Who Let The Frog Out - Anslem Douglas (originally called ""Who Let The Dogs Out"")5. Pump Up The Jam - Technotronic6. Whoomp! (There It Is) - M.C. HammerThe above 6 songs are the originals and are a lot better than the crazy frog versions. Axel F (original music by Harold Faltermeyer) is cute, but why do they have to go and ruin perfectly good oldies?Don't waste your money on this. If you must, listen to it in the store."
1,pumps slow,"It holds alot of gas but the pump is crap. it flows ok for a bit but then you nearly have to lift the thing higher to keep it flowing, and it's pretty heavy and defeats the purpose of having the pump...not worth the price."
1,No More Stoopid Cases,"I just bought the latest Futurama DVD and altho nice and colorful it was the cheapest piece of crap I have ever seen. I could have printed a Futurama image on a piece of cardboard and folded it in half myself. And now it seems The simpsons DVD collections are following suit. Well...Im out. I have avoided the stupid ""collectible head"" sets all the way to season 10 and now even the standard boxes are ridiculously constructed. I am going to buy the Krusty Head box for a massive TEN DOLLARS(thats 25% for crying out loud!!)cheaper than the standard box and then I am going to buy a 96disc wallet and THROW AWAY ALL MY SIMPSONS DVD PACKAGING!!!Other than that...The Simpsons is awesome. And I absolutely love the commentaries! Keep em coming! I wonder if I could get a discount on shipping by just having the discs sent with no case..."
1,Bleh! Chemical Odor and Taste!!!,"I'm so so so disappointed with this product. I've used the flavorless Jarrow's Coconut oil (the red package) for quite some time and really love the product. I figured I would love their full flavor coconut oil. It's terrible, there's a very strong chemical taste that makes it unpalatable and the smell is bad but it does dissipate so I'll still be considering it for skin application. Most likely I will just make some bar soap out of it and try another brand of flavored coconut oil. I've never had this problem with other organic pressed coconut oils."
2,Well worth the money..l,I got this comforter when it was only $59.99 and it was well worth the price. Light yet very warm. Came in a nice cover for storage.I have seen similiar comforters since I work in retail and None have the quality for this price.VERY SATISFIED
1,needs more,This book needs more nutritional guidelines. I couldn't get sleek and slim in two months doing just this stuff. Youd have to start out sleek and slim and this might help you maintain but not when you start at 198lbs.
2,THE COLDEST BOOK EVER,"I first read this book earlier this year and it took me two days to read it, I couldn't even sleep. I let someone borrow it and they lost it(?) and I just purchased it again. I am an avid reader and will read anything that's good and out of all the books I have read this is the best. I will not let this one out of my possession. This book is the realest book I have ever read and there are so many parts in the book that I have to read over and over because it is so true. There needs to be a movie to go along with the book. Sister Souljah is an excellent author and the book is worth investing in and adding to your collection. Hats off to Sister Souljah and if you don't have the book you don't know what you are missing."
2,Now that is how it should be,"This DVD is a must have for all the fans of Stone Cold Steve Austin, the greatest superstar in the history of the WWE, ""the toughest S.O.B. in the history of the WWE"" (as the WWE Chairman introduced him in to the WWE Hall of Fame 2009)From his worst times to the dawn of the Austin 3:16, to the greatest matches with The Rock, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, etc. everything is described by Stone Cold himself which will give every fan to have a new view about the character Stone Cold Steve Austin.This is a great WWE DVD every fan should have, and I'm watching the DVD for the 12th time at this moment too."
2,Good twists and a quick read!,"I enjoyed this book as a mystery novel. It did some jumping around in the story line, but it all came together. The end was somewhat abrupt, and just not my choice, but overall it was a good book with lots of twists and makes a great whodunnit."
2,Great! Everything I ever wanted to know!,I am pregnant with my third child and thought that I knew it all about pregnancy. After reading 1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy I realized that there is a lot I still don't know. I love the author's writing style and sense of humor. You can tell that he has been through a lot of pregnancies and has learned from each one! I like the way the book is layed out and the pictures of the sonograms. I am throwing out my What to Expect when You're Expecting and making this book the one I recommend to all of my friends!
2,A great toy for a Toy Story fan,"I was worried about the quality of this Woody doll when I read the reviews, but decided to take a chance because my 4 year old is currently obsessed with Toy Story. I was pleasantly surprised when Woody arrived. The level of detail is fantastic and he really looks and moves just like Woody in the movie. His clothes and face seem like a perfect match to me. His hat does fall off easily - but hey, it does that in the movie too.I disagree with others who complain about the voice, I think Woody sounds just fine. ""There's a snake in my boot!"" makes me laugh every time, and I'm not even 4 :)Most importantly though, my son is in love with this toy. Woody has ""ANDY"" written on one boot, just like in the movie ... the first thing my son wanted to do was write his own name on the other boot.I would buy this again and recommend it to a friend."
1,Great Oven! Lame Price!!,"I have had this Cuisinart for about a year and it is a great oven - good convection feature, reliable touch/digital controls, and fine looking in black/chrome. Compared to other consumer convection ovens it stands head and shoulders above (admitedly the competition generally sucks). Actually I would give it four and a half stars only because it has no internal light. BUT, when you can get this same black/chrome model for just under $100 at your local ClubCo (sic) warehouse, how can Amazon justify this price??"
1,Garbage,"No way will this handle 1000 watts at 17' ! Normally I read reviews, for some reason this slipped by. Wire is 8 ga if they include shielding! WASTE of $$$$$$$$. rca cables are junk as well. There are much better quality kits at this price. junk!!!"
1,Not the real thing,I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the amazingly low price for this product. I guess I got what I paid for since these pills did not work at all. The ingredients list the same as Phazyme but offered no relief.
2,Kiwi Sloggers brighten the day!,"I had a pair of these Sloggers for ten years.The soles are now worn smooth and are too slippery in the wet grass.I purchased this new pair at a price cheaper than the original pair. The new color selection was nice .Love the Kiwi green color.I originally purchased a Size 7 that was a bit small with a low cut sock. However the problem of not giving a five star rating enters here, as they are not available in half sizes.I usually wear a size 7 1/2The size eight is a bit too large but a heavier sock helps and my toes are not cramped after wearing all day.They are easily cleaned and look great for years.Much more supportive than other clogs.I am a Master Gardener and I love these Sloggers."
1,It does leak for some...,"I bought this fryer, used it once, and it leaked. Luckily I had read other reviews and had placed a cookie sheet under it before I started. If you've ever used a common deep fryer you'll know that clean up is easier with one of those than with a fryer that spills copious amounts of oil onto your counter top. My other issue with this unit is that the oil level from the bottom of the basket to the infamous ""max level"" mark is less than the width of a corn dog. That's pretty shallow for a ""deep"" fryer."
1,NO BURN!,"I am a fitness professional who has taught many classes for 10+ years and I have to say this is the single worst and most pointless routine I have ever encountered! The women are ridiculous looking, acting, and more importantly the routine is a waste of 30 min. Save your time and money! I really hate to give a bad review of anything but this was that bad!"
2,X-Pulse,"Get your heatbeat pounding with the newest expansion to the popular MechWarrior 4 Vengeance!With the addition of new Mechs, like the Sunder, Wolfhound, Uller and More, you will be able to trade on the black market for new weapons and mech chassis.I highly recommend this game, as a sysop with the Microsoft Gaming Zone!!! Play it online with up to 15 other people for the ultimate players experience...."
1,Were's the warning?,"Wheres the warning that says yeah it will neutralize, acetamiphen but will cause kidney stones, if you don't take crazy amounts of vitamin c"
2,Aaliyah at her best,"This CD truly shows Aaliyah at her very best. Her trademark fallseto voice is displayed, along with a vocal range that I never knew that she posessessed. I thoroughly enjoyed every song on this album, but my favorites are ""More than a Woman"", ""Rock the Boat"", and ""Resoulution"". I fell in love with Aaliyah when I listened to the song ""Try Again"", and this album goes well above and beyond what I expected. Though Aaliyah is not with us anymore, I know that she knew this CD was her best."
1,Quality could be better,It was dark and cloudy at times. Not the greatest buy. I am very disappointed. Can I return for a refund?
1,stereotypic,If you want a book with alot of sex you should get this but however it was a terrible book it should have been better written it categorized people in the most inane way firstly by making the people imagine that English women are better off then Muslim women or basically most women in the world it doesen't make sense and i think before this book was written Robin schone should have done a little more research on the subject before releasing it to people it was very offensive.
1,Hollow Thwok!,"The production on the album is very amateurish. The drums sound really bad. The snare has this hollow ringing thwok! sound that, I think, renders the whole album unlistenable.If you can get past the drums thing, there is some fairly interesting music on this album. But nothing really great. Not great enough for my ears to take that banging monotonous thwok! snare over and over again anyway."
1,Startrek Classic Phaser Review,"The phaser looks great but I would not recommend for smaller kids because it is not durable. The main problem i've found is the batteries. If you take them out you will have trouble getting the phaser to work after you put them back in. You may have to GENTLY adjust the prongs that touch the batteries or on the Communictor from ""Enterprise"" you may have to add a piece of cardboard between the battery cover and the batteries. All in all I was a little disappointed."
2,Suits just fine,"This liner fits well, matches the color of our interior, and has a sufficient lip to contain spills when they occur. The texture of the base could be a bit more ""grippy"" to reduce cargo slipping. Works fine for heavier objects but light ones tend to slide a bit. Rug anti-slip pad on top works well to make this a perfect cargo liner."
1,Not Happy,Love the color and how it keep you warm.But a problom with the feathers comeing out. the faethers is over every thing :(
2,eureka!,"The system works fine I have lost about 14 pound in 6 weeks! I am from Lima, Peru, and everybody wants to know more about misses Puhn system. I will like more examples of what to eat in a normal day, specially the dinner options. She makes you identify with her clients problems and feelings. Is there a spanish version? Thank you"
1,"Boring, Boring Boring","I listened to the cd and thought wow America is a great country if this women was able to sell this book. I dont think she talks to the average american women and the problems that we face regarding weight. She sounds like she is talking to the more privledged and wealthy women who have the time to sit around and dine on salmon and champagne. I had an eating disorder a number of years ago and was just kind of curious as to what her remedy to weight gain was. I must say if you battling weight gain I think one question would be to ask yourself is it more serious than what this woman proposes,and if it is a deeper problem , go see a therapist or check out a 12 step group."
2,Very interesting series,I just finished the first disk and I think this is a very interesting series. Yes looking at it with todays's eyes it looks extremely dated. Joanne Lumbley and David McCallum are great. It will take me a while to get through all of the disks but I'm looking forward to them.
2,Great Book!,"I totally recommend this book. The poems are wonderful, as are the illustrations in the book. My kids love it!"
2,Perfect for the Kodak Sport,We borrowed one of these from a family member to try with our new Kodak Sport camera. It was perfect. Just the right size to hold the camera with a little pocket for extra batteries and an SD card. It has a way to hook it on a belt or strap (we had it up front on a backpack strap while hiking) and a strap to sling it over your shoulder too. We liked it so much we bought one.
1,Disappointing,"I really liked this little light and used it everyday for 2 months. Unfortunately it's easy to install bracket, like other one and two star reviews have mentioned, degrades with time. This is understandable, but two months?? I used one of those rubber strips to hold the bracket in place, and with time even with the rubber piece the bracket would not clamp closed and stay closed. I'm disappointed that it didn't even last one riding season. Once the bracket goes there's no such thing as buying a spare, except I guess from ebay...."
1,Terrible,"Do not waste your money. So many stars, so disappointing. How do I get the last hour and a half of my life back?"
1,Predators,"I am unable to view this DVD; I receive the message ""check regional code"" on my DVD player. I can view the DVD on my lap top computer. Can you help?"
2,Bishop's Survey of French Literature,"Morris Bishop's Two Volume Survey of French Literature is a must have for the French scholar. The first volume covers the Middle Ages through the 18th Century, and the second tackles the 19th and 20th Centuries. Morris is the authority in French Literature! This set includes the works of all major French poets, playwrights, novelists, and authors as well as a synopsis of the major French literary periods and short biography of each author. Great gift for college students majoring in French or other persons interested in French literature."
2,EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAVAGANZA!!!!!!!,"This production was by far, the best I have ever seen! My husband is a tough critic and loved the show!! Although we thoroughly enjoyed Lord of the Dance, Celtic Tiger is truly as extravaganza!!! The special effects are magnifigent!!!!!! It contained a greater, more meaningful story line that gives a warm insight into Irish families who migrated to America and takes you through the time in America when they arrived. The costumes are certainly more elaborate and diversified, and the dancing is superb--more versatile and fluid. The music--fantastic!I felt exuberated after watching this show, proud to be of Irish heritage and always proud of be an American.Seriously doubt Michael Flatly and cast could EVER top this one!!!"
1,Can't get it to work.,"I purchased this recently and was looking forward to the arrival. Upon arrival I quickly found that there are a lot of do's and don'ts. Quite frankly, too much to remember. When I did finally figure it out I was unable to get a correct reading for any of the measurements. My weight was off by 60 pounds (too low)!!! I set it up for my mom as a user, and she also had incorrect readings. I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...completely useless."
2,Easy to operate. Readings appear accurate,"Omron HEM-711AC Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor with IntelliSenseI have been using this monitor for about one week. So far so good.Easy to set up and fast reading. Note: Read instructions with respect to placement of cuff on left arm vs right arm.This month its $10.00 off price, very good deal.(April 08)"
1,Stopped working after a few uses,"This is the worst blender I have ever used. It completely died after just a few uses, and I was only making ordinary smoothies. Since I used it so infrequently, it's been more than 6 months and the warranty is expired."
2,Tom Kell - excellent as ever,"Tom Kell is an interesting musician - not known by mainstream populace but highly respected by peers and those in the Americana realm. His songwriting is clever and well-thought out musically and lyrically. This piece is one of his best, well worth seeking out."
1,So HARD to talk on.,"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my daughter and I was so disappointed. She, nor I could even talk on it becuase of it's odd shape! You can't hear the other person talking because of it and they can't hear you! It just felt so awkward. Plus, it's like trying to put a puzzle piece together when your trying to hang it up. Do Not Purchase!"
2,Sturdy and makes large Popsicles,"These are very sturdy Popsicle molds. I really liked the adult size and the durability of the product, which seems very rare for popsicle molds. Deducted 1 star for the amount of space needed in freezer & the tops do not snap in place (stay closed). Both issues was able to accommodate for and does not detract from my enjoyment of the product."
1,Just returned it,"During the first few days it worked only OK - down hill from there. No one could hear me. ""Are you in a tunnel?"" ""Is it really windy there?"" ""Are you vacuuming?"" ""HELLO! HELLO! Is anyone there??""After that, the phone kept disconnecting from the device. I had to reprogram the phone to ""find"" the headset five times in just a few weeks. Then I started getting a message that the signal was too weak - even though the handset was only three ft away!"
1,don't waste your money & save the landfill space,"I just chimed in to add a one-star rating. The product is flimsy, a pain to change blades (& they pop out anyway), and lost sharpness after 2 or 3 uses. Everything now gets stuck under the blade halfway thru a slice. This thing is landfill fodder."
2,Rise of The Machines,"I enjoyed watching the 3rd installment in the terminator series. This movie had a lot of action and was quick paced. As far as sequels go, this sequel is great as it takes the storyline to the next step.... which is that the machines do start a nuclear holocaust no matter how hard John & Sarah Connor attempted to prevent Judgment Day from occurring in the past.I can only speculate that a ""Terminator 4"" may possibly be made in the future in order to see the aftermath of the nuclear fallout and how John Connor actually leads the remaining human population in an uprising against the machines that have taken over the world. So, let's hope ""Terminator 4"" is made into a movie to complete the story."
1,Laughable,"Horrific acting (oh, the coach is the absolute worst). Horrendously amateurish movie-making. Dreadful action sequences (hello, they're supposed to know how to play the game....). Lame dialogue that gets overly preachy at parts. If it had been done like a Baz Luhrman or John Waters film with that panache of being purposefully bad, it would have worked, but I get the sense it was actually taking itself seriously. *urp!*"
2,From an A. Co. 1/8 Marine,"I was there with Alpha Co. 1/8 Weapons Plt. Attached to 1st Plt.I pre-ordered this book, hoping for the best. What I got was just amazing. I read it from cover to cover in a day. All the stories, atleast the ones from Alpha Company brought back memories.This book was written well, and is nothing but factual. Some of the names/ranks are wrong but that can be forgiven. It gave the average person insight into what we went through in that city. And brought back alot of memories of the things we did.After I was done reading it I passed it along to my family to take a gander at. They were all pleased with it also.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a little knowledge on what really went down in the streets of Fallujah."
2,Stop Male pattern baldness,"Saw Palmetto blocks testosterone from forming DHT, dihydro-testosterone,which causes male-patterned balness and BPH, benign prostate hypertrophy. It is something every adult male should take. I have been taken it for twenty years or so and I have all my own hair and no problems with BPH( BTW, I'm 60 years old). You'll find it in all vitamins formulated for adult men for a reason. There might not be enough to be effective in your multi-vitamin, however.Gunner May 2,007"
1,The Deadhouse,"Disappointing !! This book was a non starter. The few interesting plots were never resolved, ( maybe they will be in a future book) The main story line was just NOT interesting. I never cared about any of the characters and there was not enough of Alex's private life which I always enjoy. I could have put this book down and never come back to it. But I kept expecting it to get good, based on all of her previous books. It took me 9 weeks to read this book....need I say more."
1,"I know 1987, and this movie has nothing to do with 1987.","Beside the fact that I was terribly bored with the story, it was unbelievably inaccurate. The clothing, the hair, the fact that none of these 18 year olds had trouble getting booze or getting into clubs - it made me wonder if any of the filmmakers were alive in 1987. I remember a lot more hairspray and hot rollers, and fake IDs.The only character that's sympathetic is the Russian lit major, and his one good chance at a conflict fizzles like a dud firecracker. The rest of the characters are boring and one dimensional. The so-called love story is clearly going to be a failure, regardless of how it turns out.Don't bother with this one."
2,fun for little ones,"this was a great toy for little ones, from ages 1-7however it did have a strong plastic smell. the sizewas big enough for about 3 infant/toddlers"
2,Beautiful doll!,"This doll is so pretty, my daughter loves it. It has accessories that you can purchase separately and she is an up to date doll for the more savvy little girl who wants more than a baby doll."
2,wONDERFUL PRODUCT,"i STARTED USING THESE BAGS WHEN UN STORES and now I go to all extremes to keep them on hand. The handle ties are fabulous. Why are they NOT available in stores,I hope tey are always available. MKH THANK YOU."
2,Words can't describe....,"This album is something that comes along maybe once every 10 years. I havent' heard music that makes me tingle, fly, laugh, and dance like this one for more than ten years prior to this one and for the few years since. It's incredible.These two guys, when they get together, do some incredible things. Their blend of eastern instruments and other ethnic sounds with the melodies and samples that they've chosen is outstanding. Their ability to change the tempo of the tracks from one minute to the next is unparalleled. In one album, even in particular tracks, they manage to take you on a journey all across the globe delving into some of the world's different cultures. This album will blow you away. It's as you can tell by now, one of my all time favorites, and Shpongle is one of my most revered bands of all time. No joke. Enjoy."
1,"Bible? ""Opinion"" would have been a better title choice.","Being an avid fan of the paranormal, I couldn't wait to delve into Trent Brandon's ""The Ghost Hunter's Bible."" I was so disappointed! I found far more opinions than facts, and it was absolutely full of grammatical errors and misspellings. This book appears to be one man's attempt at self publication rather than a professional work. I cannot in good conscience recommend this ""Bible"" to other ghost and supernatural devotees -- whether they be of the amateur OR professional level."
2,Great!,"I am glad that Ann got the issue of family rivalry out in the open. I was a middle child among two other strong-willed children and the fights between Dawn, Jeff and Mary Anne sounded sooo familiar! I fought like heck with my brother and sister. My parents were driven half mad! I chuckled in spite of myself; kids fight over the silliest things and Ann has a gift of mixing a little black humor in with the strife. Good going, Ann!However I think that Dawn and Jeff are spoiled brats who didn't get enough, if any, spankings in their life. I would have taken them both to the ""woodshed"". They were very rude to their stepfather who was trying very hard to get to know them!"
2,A MASTERPIECE!!!,"This is Olga's best Pop / Tropical album yet, it has a little of everything for all tastes. All the ""Bandolero"" versions are tastefully done to be played according to your mood or music desire. It has some great dancing tracks with incredible world sounds. The 6 songs she wrote are amazing, I hope that we get to see more of her as a composer in the future. This is a must have Pop/Tropical album for fans and non-fans. It's hands-down the best Latin album of the year!!! TWO GRANDES THUMBS UP!!!"
2,A Tearful & Beautiful Story!,"The first story in this video is inspiring, moving, and tearful. It has acting that is stellar and should have won an emmy award. I couldn't stop crying. MUST HAVE!"
2,Great book...A bible for med. students.,Great book to have for learning medicine. Hard to get good grades without it!!!
2,A classic,"This is one of those records I play when I want to turn my rock pals into metal fans, metal fans into rock fans and everyone else that likes great music. I have listened to this record more times than I can count. There's a few clunker tunes that I invariably skip - but the scorchers are top rate. So many awesome components to this band: great noise, great art, great tones, huge balls in general, great riffs, vocalists work well together tonally. There are some CRUSHING tunes on this release and the closer is a classic outro of great dirty rock. Fans of the Grifters have to own this. I do not agree that Tuplip and Some Coctail Suggestions are better. This is their best IMO and the fact that they never really took off is a shame. Rarely do people hear this and not request a copy. I can easily dismiss the less interesting tunes because the peaks are so awesome. This is one of the best rock records of the 90s. The art alone is worth the purchase price IMO."
2,So good!,"My first question is, why wasn't THIS made into a movie?! I would of loved to see this on the big screen instead of ""The Lucky One."" I will admit, the first few chapters of this book was hard to get through. I wasn't pleased at first. I thought it was going to be boring. But I was very, very pleased as I started getting further into it. A great love story, and a great suspense thriller as well. All mixed in with a good story about a good dog. You can't go wrong!"
1,Straying afar,"Jodi...write what you know. You are good at getting into the minds of your characters... usually. You almost did OK with Trixie, but blew it with Daniel - at both ages. But don't feel too bad, you can't hit a home run every time you come to the plate."
2,Gets me moving!,"I'm over 60, and very much of a computer potato. The Wii (with the Sports bundle) gets me off the computer (for a while every day, anyway!) and gets me moving! Bowling is the most fun sport for me. I also bought the Wii Fit to go with it. It's helping me with my overall strength, as well as body balance issues. It's even helping my overweight husband. There is a great variety of games to choose from, so that even when I'm feeling not-so-good on any given day, I can choose lower-energy games (exercises.) I have zero complaints! I love it, and can't imagine ever ""outgrowing"" it or getting bored with it!"
1,Keynes is re- born as Krugman,"Prof. Krugman at least is no apologist when it comes to supporting Keynes and his brand of economics. Not being an apologist , however , doesn't mean he is right. In fact mathematical expression of economics is totally devoid of reality. Economics cannot be simplied into equations, which is what Mr. Krugamn wants us to believe. Mant people in high places have come out strongly disagreeing with the medicine Mr. Krugman proposed and continues to propose for Japan's problems. I would suggest that most people should not pay much attention to the prescriptions in this book as we had similar Keynesian type policies discredited."
1,"It's sad, so sad","I totally agree with the other one here, this is just terrible, should not be allowed to sell. Elton is the greatest, this is the worst. So sad"
2,Perfect for Adoption from the Foster System,"We have 2 boys we adopted from our state's foster system and a birth sibling little girl we're hopeing to adopt. While the pages are not exciting, this is a great book to record a fostered/adopted child's information. This book provides a place for answers children may want to learn about their adoption and why they came into foster care. I too like you can remove the pages that aren't relevent. There is a place for a birth family tree, and adopted family tree and even a family tree for single adoptive parents. I do wish there were more blank pages provided and the book was a little less spendy.I would not nessisarily recommend this book for international or domestic private adoptions. It is the best record keeper for life stories and as a ""baby book"" for an older child."
2,Foolproof,"Having tried many times many times to add a towing connector on my vast array of ancient cars, once I tried a seven pin, never again, I was extremely skeptical about adding a four pin flat towing connector to my 2006 Subaru Tribeca.How wrong I was. IT WAS A BREEZE. The hardest thing was removing the small black plastic Phillips head screws from the storage tray which sat over the spare tire. If you are a non mechanical type do not let this worry you.An excellent product and so easy to add to your car."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"I love Wesley Snipes, I have enjoyed many of his movies, but this is one is really really bad. It is painful to watch this film, if you can even call it that. The only part of this movie I found cool was the credit sequence at the beginning and the opening shot. The rest of this movie is a pile of cliches, with no purpose. The action sequences are very mediocre, with nothing new being shown. The dialogue in this movie is where this movie gets hurt very badly. The plot is ok, but if the dialogue had been sharper this movie could of at least been watchable. The one-liners made me cringe. The conversations between the characters is the same old, same old. This movie is completely unwatchable, and I recommend you don't watch as it will destroy your respect for Wesley, which no one want to happpen."
1,this game will turn your kids into serial killers,"i recently rented this game for my son and i immediatly took it back when i saw how much blood and gore there was. incredible. how can people play a game where you just kill people. also, since my sons brain is just developing these ideas of killing people would have affected his brain development if i hadnt taken it away sooner. all in all, this game teaches you to be a serial killer, and i believe that all the kids who play this game excessivly will turn out this way. DONT BY THIS GAME!"
2,Greatest Egyptian Magazine Ever!,"Go ahead...you know you want it. It's worth the money and it's a great magazine. They don't ""dumb down"" their articles and it is often a challenge for me to understand everything they are writing about but I am an armchair archaeologist who has been to Egypt and I am nuts for all things Egyptian. I thinks it's well worth the price."
1,Poor Excuse for speaker Wire,"I have a Bose system and needed the RCA audio plugs and the split wire to hook up my speakers. When I opened up the box, I was surprised to find the wire was so thin. I've never seen wire this small before for speakers. I'm not happy at all with this product and wish they had actually put the wire guage in the details. Now I know why it was so cheap."
2,"Good book, but some college needed.","Lots of good theory and application on electric motors, but to get the most out of it, you really should have 2 semesters of college level physics and 1 semester of electrical engineering. The book covers the theory of how and why motors work, but could have been a better book with a simple explanation as a preface to each chapter. Also, a simple explanation of the differences between the various types motors. It seems that this is a sophmore level college text and is excellent for that purpose."
1,For FRUSTRATION only,"The very worst available. I spent half of our summer vacation trying to find discs that my pretentious Canon would accept. Only Sony, and only sometimes. Ugh. I used to trust Canon. Now, I will read and write reviews more often."
2,Great Plot,The suspense is great and the storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat. True passion and love shines through in this book. A must read!
1,Is this how people perceive modern rock these days?,"God, I sure hope not. They throw a heavy and, though slightly catchy, predictable and overused power chord progression against some emo rap and you guys call it a ""classic""? Seriously, turn off your crappy radio for a few days and find some good music. Into rap? There's a huge amount of underground hip-hop artists that deserve recognition (blackstar, sage francis, atmosphere, aesop rock, apathy, esoteric, living legends, and on and on and on). Into catchy guitars? Queens of the Stone Age, Eagles of Death Metal, Kings of Leon, the Strokes, Frank Black, the Hives, the Cardigans (pre- Long Gone), the Coral. Believe it or not, there IS better music out there."
1,Waste of time or money,This educational toolkit is not worth the time or money. Each segment of it has to be installed separately. Very primitive content. Insult to a normal child.
1,Horrible...,"After hearing the hype about Cornwell and then reading Death's Acre, I was excited to try out my first Cornwell book. I found the story line long, drawn out and boring and SO boring in fact, I could not even finish the book. If this story is any indication of Ms. Cornwell's other works, I am not interested in the least."
1,Not complete,"This book wastes half its space on magazine-style ""advice"" to high school seniors. The actual ""guide"" part seems like less than half the text of the book. Catholic colleges are Christian, but they are not included here at all. I don't think Quaker schools are here, either. Most of all, I was disappointed that the information about each college didn't include whether or not the college has a ""dry"" (no alcohol) campus, which is what attracts me most to the idea of a Christian school in the first place."
2,Size is fantastic!,This item was purchased for our office and it looks great - we have had many many comments on it. It is lighter weight than I expected but that has been a plus also. Would like it even better if the hands were not so flimsy. Am worried someone will walk past it and catch on them and break them. Otherwise we do like it.
1,Very vague,"This book has some excellent sketches, but VERY lacking in explanation. The whole thing was kind of like Step 1: Draw the outline using a thin line, Step 2: Draw everything else.Might be a good book if it had more instruction."
2,AWESOME!!!,"A GREAT story! A GREAT Author! I can't wait to read more by Huggins. This story has it all...mystery, suspense, action, and intrique. Top it off with a great biblical message and a true-to-life depiction of Satan's demeanor. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who likes action thrillers."
2,"FASCINATING,SENSIBLE READ","The Greenwich Diet picks up where others fail. The theories and wellness plan presented in this book do one thing, and that is deliver what they promise. Your level of wellness and physical abilities will definately improve. So get you and your friends out of the ""Zone"" and into the Greenwich Diet! Bears don't bake bisquits, but I'm sure they use GREEN ketchup!"
2,"Suspenseful, Interesting Thriller","This book starts off fast with the psychopathic killer then quickly introduces the hero Richard Corrigan, a cop. The thru the wilderness chase is fun, you're always wondering who is going to buy the farm next. And I found myself shifting several times back and forth on the actual ""killer"", always a good sign.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I called the ending about 3/4 of the way thru...but a good suspenseful read. If you like thrillers, check it out."
1,"Writing a LIfe: Teaching Memoir to Sharpen Insight, Shape Meaning--and Triumph Over Tests",This book was not what I expected. It deals with writing in schools and has very little use for the writing and group I facilitate.
2,Item exactly as I expected,"I used Nortel phones at work, and loved the one-line version of this phone, so when I installed a home office, I wanted to use the 2-line version. While Nortel phones are now made by Aastra, the phone is identical in every way to the old Nortel version."
2,No regrets about No Regret.,The DVD story is sweet & cute. There are a couple of rough edits in the movie and the love sceens were cut short. I wish they had been the original. Definatly a DVD for any gay guys collection.
2,great,"This was the greatest book I have ever read. The material was excellent and the authors writing style superb. This was the first Lung book I read and after I was hooked. As much as I was enjoying it and being absolutely hypnotised by it that i'm sure the authors really knew what they were talking about. I give it five stars, but having said that, this book probably isn't for everyone."
1,Thumbs Down on Baby Bear,"My daughter is just beginning to speak. This video highlights Baby Bear and his significant speech impediment. It's not cute, it's not child-like, it's incorrect pronunciation! I agree completely with the other reviewer who noted that it's irresponsible of CTW to have a character who speaks like Baby Bear. This is not a dig at people with speech impediments -- it's frustration at the choices Sesame Street has made -- to offer a ""teaching"" tool that teaches incorrect speech patterns. We won't play this video again at our house."
2,"It's hard for me to say much without spoilers, but I'll try","I just finished this book, literally minutes ago. My thoughts on it are still swimming around. Overall, I have to say it was really well-crafted. Parts of it were really tragic, which was the point. Most of the character arcs had endings I really didn't see coming, except for Felisin. I predicted where she was going to wind up in the end. She was incredibly difficult to read, although I can't say she was unrealistic. Her chapters were just so difficult to get through; they were so bleak. But hers, as I said, was the only story I was able to guess at. I found Icarium and Mappo rather poignant. Fiddler grew on me quite a bit. And Kalam surprised me most of all.There were a lot of things that happened here that seem they'll have ramifications in later books. I look forward to seeing what comes of this."
1,Cat did not like,My cat played with this a few minutes the first day we got it. After that he did not play with it at all.
2,Tangled Ever After,"My 6 daughters, from ages 2-14, absolutely loved this little short. Its a shame that it wasnt included on the bluray discs we bought but oh well."
1,Tolkien would be rolling over in his grave!,This game is a real stinker. Your party members wander off constantly and moments later you'll hear them grunting as they're be slaughtered by an troll. After playing 10 minutes of this game you just want orcs to kill you and you're whole party. This game was a big letdown.
2,Great Christian film,This film is very inspiring if your desire is to serve God. I was challenged and would definately recommend this purchase.
1,Not clear on size,"All they say is ""Package comes with 4-pieces of 4"" spring clamps."" When I have purchased the spring clamps in the past the size was the throat opening. Not for these. The 4"" refers to their length. These are more comparable to the 2"" throat opening clamps I've purchased in the past.With that, these are still useful, though they aren't what I was expecting. Also, being that size, the price here isn't a good price as I can get 4 clamps this size from Home Depot for $4 and don't have to wait for shipment."
1,Didn't work with my MP3 player,"I picked this little gadget up because it claimed it was a univeral music adapter.Well, it didn't work with my Intel MP3 unit (which incidentally did work with an older music adapter I had. It did work with my old disc man and did work with an iRock MP3 player.If it works, it's great, if not well, it's garbage.The 1 star is for lack of support or listing of compatible players.Also, if you live in an are where high and low frequencies on the FM band are used by existing radio stations, then this won't work well because it will interfere with the local broadcase. I found it to work poorly in both NYC and DC."
2,An unfortunate casualty,"2006 and I'm still using this little beauty. Clean interface, great dictionary/thesaurus, and an indispensable style guide. A searchable quotation database and an adequate world map feature add to this haiku of a program.Microsoft dumped this in 2001 and replaced it with Encarta. Too bad. I wish they still made software like this...it does more with less."
1,A gross misrepresentation,"Heider misquotes and misrepresents people continuously. In some cases she attributes positions to them that were the complete opposite of what they said. She misspells names and gets basic facts wrong. She claimed, for instance, that Malthus was the first to apply Darwin's theory of evolution to social issues. Malthus wrote his book before Darwin was born and was dead before Darwin wrote his first work on evolution. Her research was shoddy and amateurish and she quite blantantly distorts and falsifies positions taken by people. One of the worst books on the topic and virtually worthless. It can not be trusted even in basic facts."
2,A really great spotting scope for the cost.,"This is truly a great spotting scope for it's relatively modest cost. Sure there are better but at a considerable premium. Get the hard carry case, well worth the extra cost."
2,Great mounting option for security and mobility,"I bought this for two reasons:Security - GPS units are a highly prized target for thieves. They can walk down a row of parked cars and see a mount on the windshield or the mark left by the suction cup and assume a GPS is in the glove box. You can move this mount to the floor of the car/truck or glove box in 2 seconds and it leaves no mark. No sign of a GPS unit on the dash/windshield.Mobility - I can unplug the charger and move it to my wifes car or the motorhome fast. It's the easiest mobile mount there is for a Garmin at this time. I do not need to buy extra mounts for other vehicles. No glue pads on the dash.. It's GreatIt's very stable... I drive windy, bumpy, rural roads and it does not move, slide at all. I drive a Jetta with a rounded dash and it does not move!"
1,Disappointed and Frustrated,"I bought this toy box for my daughter and it came without instructions, which made it difficult to put together. Even so, I managed to figure it out. However, the safety hinge didn't work. The spring in the hinge literally had no give, therefore, the lid wouldn't close no matter what we did. The wood sounded as though it was going to snap. Since we didn't have instructions, my husband and I tried putting the spring on in every way possible. I had to return the toy box because there was clearly something severely wrong with the hinge. Needless to say, I was very disappointed and frustrated."
2,Get ready for adventure,"Tessa leaves Ireland on a stolen passage, reaches America to take on a new name and travel as a completely different person. After a conversation with a helpful ghost, foiling a villian and gaining a family Tessa follows a series of clues to claim her inheritance. A book that you will not want to put down until it is finished. Excellent writing by this new author."
2,Zoey Fools Around,"I first picked up this book when i was 11. I was, and always will be very fussy about what I read and although it took me a while to get into, I loved this book.Looking back, i think i was too you to have read this book, it deals with more mature issues such as sex and alcohol.I am glad i read this book though as now they have become beyond impossible to find. I would reccomend it to any teenage girl. It may sound a bit trashy with a title like ""Making Out"" but after youread it you will know it was very a worthwhile read."
1,I have a better one for you...,"A friend of mine was terribly disappointed in the Avent bottle warmer, so went out and bought The First Years brand. She RAVED about it so much that I went out and bought one (I was using the stove-top to heat the bottles to that point). I love it so much. Yes, I ocassionally have to run bottles through a second time to get them heated up nice and warm - but it is still easy and convenient. It was [inexpensive]"
2,Good Cheap Reliable LOUD,"I've had this alarm clock for a number of years. (I believe at least 3)I never had to change the battery and it just keeps telling me:The time, date, temp, as well as waking me the hell up.I have serious, serious, problems with waking up...Aside from this alarm.. I use.. my phone, another radio alarm, my stereo.The loudness of this alarm makes me set the time on it as a last resort when all of the abovefail to get my zombie..butt... out of bed.It is so loud, I have to jump out of bed... at least to turn it off... in fear of waking up the neighbors in my apartment building.*****I never really adjusted the time on it, it seems to reset itself, it knows when the daylight savings times are..after about 3 years of use.. it's a little bit on the fast side by about 2 or 3 min.I kinda need the head start so I don't mind"
2,Excellent,"After buying some of the later U2 albums, and enjoying them, I decided to go back to the early days of the band and see what they had to offer. I soon discovered that I certainly hadn't heard the best of U2. Songs such as ""I will follow"", ""Out of control"" and ""A day without me"", certainly rival any other U2 hit over the past 18 years as some of their best. I HIGHLY recommend this CD."
1,Horrible,"I give this one a thumbs down --> if it were a school grade it would receive an F in all catagories. However, this system would not permit a continuation without a star rating"
2,so honest and beautiful,"This is a blues album. It's both beautiful and raw and touches that part of you where old flames lie. I find her voice so unique and emotional. It's perfect for the type of music she writes. I don't know about it being ""too honest"". Sometimes that's the kind of music you want to hear. I love the combination of deep emotional themes coupled with her sexy voice. Great stuff!"
2,A fast-paced THRILLER!,"This book was an awesome book. It was way better than the other book I read by her, ""The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore."" It even scared me a couple of times. I would've given it 4.5*, but I couldn't. I give this a 9 of a 10. And who the killer is, is so funny and unpredictable. Buy this book. It's worth it."
1,not really good,"i would like for it to distribute the load on my back but i feel that it makes me feel like it puts all or most of the pressure in two points in my upper back and lower back, which strains my middle back.the straps a little bit narrow and were starting to come off after only 2 months of use, without putting in it anything heavier than clothes.paid $7 to a tailor to fix it.im content w it i guess, but was disappointed about the straps, so i rated 2 stars.i only have had it for 3 months now, lets see how it goes for the next year."
1,I'm furious about this!,"I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2. It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit. Technical support was of no help. I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine. I am so frustrated about this. I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling. If I were a small business, I would be out of business. All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit. Totally unacceptable!"
2,What an action movie should be!,"This is an excellent example of what an action movie is all about. It is packed with spectacularly choreographed fight scenes. The director really focuses on these scenes and you get very detailed blow by blow sequences. I wasn't in the mood to read any subtitles, so I viewed with the English track and the new sound mix. The language is very explicit and is similar to Scarface with its F-bomb usage. The plot is very thin, so check you brains at the door.All in all this was a very entertaining, albeit gruesome, movie. It will get your heart pumping and adrenaline going. You will not be disappointed."
1,Finger holes crack easily = useless,"Both sizes have cracked with minimal use. The finger-hole plastic is very thin/weak (fyi, the inner yellow is actually just soft rubber). They did cut nicely before they broke but are essentially useless now. Let's just say I wouldn't buy anything ""Westcott"" again."
1,Don't waste your time...,"The trailers made the move look absolutely hilarious for one reason: they showed ALL or darn near all of the funny scenes. During the entire movie, you expect and wait for them and there is no comical pay-off; You have already seen them and know the outcome. In between the known gags are terrible, terrible ones. They do produce a laugh just because of their utter stupidity and gross-out factor. Bottom line: Haven't seen the trailer? Rent the film. Seen the trailer? You've seen the movie."
1,"worst shoes EVER, DON'T BUY IT",I usually don't review products but I had to tor this one. ITS THE WORST SHOES EVER. it ripped after 2 weeks. my knee started hurting like nothing else. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Its low low quality product.
2,Excellent book,"Very outstanding book, helped a ton of things that are just ""assumed"" elsewhere(datasheets, app notes and the like). While it's heavily based in math the book is presented in a very clear way where the math not at the forefront."
2,"Motivational, but recreatable","This is a collection of items intended for use with the No Plot No Problem ""novel in a month"" system which started the whole NaNoWriMo thing. It's a great kit and full of motivational supplies to help keep you going but be aware there is next to no ""how to write better"" tips. The only real thing it suggests will help is writing more frequently, which I agree with. The kit is helping me complete my writing goals, but now that I have the kit, I could probably make everything in it myself. I would recommend the product but some may be very disappointed with how basic and ""cute"" it is."
1,Horrible,"This light is very very dim. I own it in green camo (the only color choice at the store where I bought it) and used it with a Sony eReader. I had to keep moving it up and down to light the top and bottom of the screen, which is smaller than a normal book's page, and the half that I was trying to read was VERY dimly lit. Save your money and get a better booklight."
1,Problem,"Dear SirI have received all the 3 CD's thank you. Both GiggleBellies Musical Adventures DVDs (part 1 and 2) plays very well but my DVD player could not play BabyGenius 'Favourite Nursery Rhymes' an error ""no disc' appears on the player. I have checked with a technician and was told that the problem is with the cd. In this case will you replace this cd with a new cdRgdsSuntharathevan"
1,VERY BAD MOVIE,"This is a lame and completely unbelievable movie straight from the 1950s-type phony monsters. A group of women decide to spelunk, with no ""flight plan"" filed with anyone. Then of course one of them chooses to take the rest into an unexplored cave without mentioning to the others that it could be is dangerous. With friends like that.....Then of course, in the cave, blind monsters (people in rubber suits) show up to murder all the women.First of all, why would such strong, fearless women in the beginning of the movie suddenly turn into cringing, screaming, and hysterical stereotypes.Secondly, the monsters are so badly done that one expects to see zippers on the back of their rubber suits.Steer clear of this movie. It is horrible. I was embarrassed for the filmmakers."
1,Dont Waste Your Time,"I tried to love this book, I really did, but I just couldnt. Sophie Kinsella could have gone soooo many diffrent ways with the newlywed phase of Becky's life and chose to go THIS way? It started out pretty good, but lost me quite quickly. I had great hopes, since I -ADORE- the first three books, but this one failed to live up to its' predecessors. Maybe I had too high of hopes for this part of Bex's life, but if I were you, I'd skip this book."
1,SONY RIPOFF,"Finally, 1963's remake of ""The Old Dark House"" is getting a DVD release. What a shame it's bundled into a collection featuring a batch of William Castle movies that have already been released as single items... except for ""The Old Dark House""! Sorry, Sony. This Castle fan ISN'T going to pay $70 just to get hold of one movie. At least I have a copy of it originally telecast over Australian Pay TV several years ago... that will have to do.David"
2,Invaluable,"There are a million books on starting businesses, and every five years or so one comes along that raises the bar. Ehrenfeld's breakthrough book on entrepreneurship presents a sharp set of tools that set it apart from the pack. Clear, concise writing makes the difference. While many entrepreneurs have been successful in business, they haven't been able to give others the right information. In The Startup Garden, you'll get a complete toolkit and -- perhaps most important -- the keys to timing your business so that you have the true sense of an entrepreneur. This book won't help someone like Steve Jobs, but for the rest of us, it's worth its weight in stock certificates."
1,"Good Idea, But Didn't Last","I thought this was the perfect cap for my 4"" bumper on a Fleetwood pop-up camper, but it has a few flaws. Good quality materials and easy to install on the camper, only took a few minutes. Once I put it on, I couldn't get my sewer hose out of the bumper and hand to take off the metal clip that pounds onto the end. The metal clip the line connects to was just thick enough that the hose wouldn't slide out. Next trip out I get to my destination and the metal clip is still on one end of the bumper, but the cap had fallen out and the line broke, allowing it to be deposited along the highway somewhere. Still have one on the other end. I am just going to buy two bolts and stick them through the holes in the end of the bumper and be done with it."
2,Fantastic & Refreshing!,"I found this movie to be a great surprise! It contains no sex scenes, it hardly has any rough language to it, and wow, it was entertaining! The main character's job is that of a reverse engineer. So is the whole movie! YOU get to reverse engineer his life, right along with him as he tries to figure out what he did before his memory was erased.I've been waiting and waiting for this to be available as a digital download, to add it to my collection. I rank it up there with other great computer-type movies, such as Sneakers, Hackers, Wargames, and Tron.Great special effects, really cool plot line & even if you've seen it before, you'll watch it again to see if you missed any clues!I've seen a lot of bad ratings on this movie, but I don't see where any of those people get what they wrote. Sex may sell, but it isn't needed in order to have a great movie. Plenty of movies in days gone by had no sex and yet they were terrific movies."
2,Great Fragrance!,"This is a nice, clean, and innocent scent. I recommened it for anyone that wants to smell fresh and clean!"
2,An Artistic Vision Brought to the Screen,"It's rare to see a film reach the public exactly as the director intended. Rumble Fish however has not been crippled by concerns over the movie's commercial viability, and is an accurate rendering of Coppola's vision. Both vivid and moody, Rumble Fish spins to life a world that's hard to forget. The cast, dialogue, cinematography, and soundtrack all are top-notch."
2,Great sub and customer service.,The sub I bought was defective but my brother has the same sub and it beats. 100 luxury is going to send me a new one while I send the defective one back. They have emailed me a lot and are taking care of me. I will recommend them to everyone just because they care about there customers. It a quality most company's do not have but they do. I can't wait to get my new one because I know for a fact that it is a good sub.
1,Disappointing For Me,"Hard to beat Mad Love, and this one doesn't come close. The songs as a whole seem too screechy and too percussive. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
1,Zell the Shill/ A Deficit of Brain Power,"Zell Miller must be the worst poker player in history. He hitched his demogogue wagon to Dubyas horse and rode off into political oblivion. This book is a load of what those horses leave behind. Shallow, anti intellectual, pandering to the 'duh,yuh' crowd. Quoting scripture to support warmongering, torture, materialism, and hatred. It would be hard to find a more cynical self serving politician who sold out to the wrong side for less. This book has less intellectual value than Larry the Cable Guy's movie, and appeals to the same crowd. If you have a dirty spot to cover up, or need to start a fire, this book might be useful, otherwise, run away as fast as you can, run little children before the virus rots you brain..."
2,Useful Application of Jungian Types to Leadership,"This has been done before, but the author here does it very well--The book applies the four classic personality types to ten different leadership functions. In addition to the explanations of the author's view of the ten leadership functions, there is advice on strengths and weaknesses of each personality type in applying each of the ten functions. The author focuses on trying to work effectively with your personality type. He assumes (correctly, for most of us) that we are not going to change decades of personality traits based on reading a book. So he doesn't urge the introverted reader to ""be more outgoing"" or try to make the control freak loosen up. Worth reading for those who aspire to manage or lead."
2,Does the job for about an hour,"Educational value, one of the ratings criteria, is irrelevant for this toy, so this should be disregarded. But, as this was one of the criteria, I had to rate it low. Overall, this is a very good toy, but it because of the size of the bottle it blows bubbles for only about an hour. I also had to wiggle the bottle when it was low to get the flow going again. I had reasonable expectations for this toy, so I'm happy with the product for the price."
2,Much watch carefully!,"I loved this movie. It really gave the true story of our country today in subtle ways you almost miss it. I loved all the characters, everyone played an important part and their acting was great. The freedom to create for excellence is something that is being taken away from us today in the US. I recommend this video to everyone who would like to see where our country is headed and to be aware of the signs today and be serious to stop it."
1,bad,terriblemade no senseonly good thing was seeing Kelly Carlson naked(i think they just put that in so people might see it)
2,Keeps car battery charged,"I have a car that I never drive and the battery is always dead. My mother in law needed to borrow it today, but of course it would not start. I plugged the solar charger into the cigarette lighter and faced it toward the sun. I came back 3.5 hours later and the car started perfectly. For a car that you barely drive this is a great solution! I plan to leave the charger on the dash from now on."
1,mad chirping,"this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this. we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system. when the chirping started about several months ago we didn't have a clue (and still don't) on how to stop it. there was no manual or instruction left. its electric and I don't know how to get to the battery. i can't believe they put these smoke alarms in new houses without a manual. after viewing all the negative reviews and seeing that the product is discontinued, we will probably have to replace all of smoke alarms in our house. there's one in every room. how can a company provide a product with no instrutions to service it."
2,Great Resource for Menopause Self-Management,This DVD provided me with good information about hormones and ways to self-manage them. The supplementary information is extremely helpful too.
1,Boring,"This is the most boring game in the world. Amazon has it listed under adventure games but it is a puzzle game, and one puzzle over and over again. Snore. Any price is too much."
1,Walter Voell,"Walter Voell is a member of the youth organisation of the german conservative party. he offers a book, which maybe does not exist. a lot of people did not receive a book after payment.have a look at http://www.besttoplists.com/000-ss16.htm (german!) this is serious!"
1,A little history.............,"Flying Dutchman, the brainchild of the famous writer/producer Bob Thiele, was one of the most innovative jazz labels to emerge in the late sixties/early seventies. The roster was wide and varied, but had a common theme: quality. The music had an edge to it that was complemented by the well-designed gatefold sleeves with comprehensive notes. The label ran from 1969 to 1976 after which some of the artists were transferred to RCA, who had been distributing the label. In this anthology we have tried to encapsulate the breath and quality of the label by featuring the main artists that recorded for it and its subsidiaries. We feature many of the popular tracks from the label, although we have deliberately omitted a few tracks that have been reissued or included in other compilations on numerous occasions."
1,Disappointment,"I`ve bought the second edition of this book following the recommendation of my predecessor.My impression, however, is pretty much the opposite:- miserable didactic style (the first chapters are trivial, the rest is just a mess of hieroglyphics, thereby lacking mathematical conscientiousness)- far too little intuitions (even if easily implementable)- cumbersome or missing explanations and algorithms- patchy definitions- typos (whilst no errata could be found on the internet)- inadequate exercisesBesides, the physical quality of the book is bad as well:One has to use considerable force otherwise the book won`t stay open (if you want to work with several books at a time, for example).When using highlighters, there will be marks on the backsinde of the page as well.The book is overpriced as well (~$85)."
1,Domestic violence is not acceptable.,"This book started out improbable then went from bad to worse.The heroine's father is verbally and emotionally abusive but she feels she must tolerate it as she loves him and is sure he loves her -which he doesnt.Hence, she gives up the man she loves TWICE for her father who treats her as worse than a slave!Not acceptable!No-one should be feel guilt tripped into tolerating in a situation of domestic violence and his book deserves one star due to its promoting this very mistaken view."
1,WHAT SORT OF CHRISTMAS IS THIS????,"This sure aint no Christmas album. Except for Mary Did You Know, Up on the Housetop and I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus, the rest of the songs could easily have been included on any of her pop CDs. And the first three are totally a waste here. Reba only does well on ""Mommy Kissing Santa Claus""."
2,Battlezone,"Battlezone is a fast, furious, and at times, a very hard game. There's three different gaming modes for different tastes. The commander mode is kind of like the game starcraft, except that you are in a vehicle fighting too, instead of being some sort of crazed war god. People that like to blow stuff up should definately give this game a try."
2,A Great Look into a Unique World,"Phil Bossert offers a detailed look into the difficult but rewarding life of Air Force Academy Cadets. He's chosen to concentrate on one very unique aspect of USAFA, the Cadet Honor Code. Few college students live under such a exacting standard to neither lie, cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do. His characters must resolve some very difficult issues and the reader is rewarded with a very good story line. This is a worthy effort from a first time published author. As an Academy graduate, I can highly recommend ""Core Values""."
1,SWG sucks now!!!,"Used to be a great, fun online game. The first MMO I ever played. Tough to get started off in, but the complexity kept me playing for over a year and a half. Now SOE has made terrible changes to the combat system, and dumbed everything down, reducing the original 30+ professions to just 9. They also made Jedi a starting profession, which some people spent countless hours to get previously. The Jedi mystique is gone, the fun is gone, and I am gone from the game. Don't start this one - you'll just get frustrated and quit."
2,"The author is very detail oriented, and explores all sides","The claim that not ONE British account of the genocide is present is ludicrous. The book has plenty of accounts from ALL sides. Take Page 119: Captain Harry Armstrong, ranking officer is being marched through the desert by a Turkish army unit when he comes across proof. People need to read this book before they make ludicrous claims about it."
1,Not His Best,"Like many others I am a big fan of Stephen King. Most of his books are terrific but ""Dreamcatcher"" joins his other two bombs, ""The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon"" and ""The Talisman"". The first part of the book is well written but it later deteriorates into gibberish. I had a hard time telling who was in who's mind or who was doing what to which when. As someone once said ""In every fat book there's a thin book trying to get out"". King claims to have written this whole book with a fountain pen. I hope he has gotten over his writer's cramp by now so he can start on a better book up to his usual higher standard. Think thin (or is it ""Thinner""."
2,"For looks, It can't be beat... durability, however...","...is something completely different. It looks great, but the cocking action itself gave out after a few months. And it probably isn't the most powerful thing in the airsoft world, but you can't beat this price!!!"
2,It's Ok,It is an Ok product for the price. The pictures are some what blurry but other than that it's great.
2,DigiFirer Radio Strobe Trigger,"I purchased this as the most economical replacement available locally when my older radio slave needed repair. Transmitter is small, light, and fits the hot shoe on my SLR.Though one really needs little in terms of instructions, I would have liked more information about battery life, especially for the receivers, which have no switch. The dealer was so confident about the long life of the 24v transmitter battery that they didn't even stock replacements. I think I will try to find a backup battery anyway.The ""keyhole"" slot for the attachment fixture on the receiver seems to have been designed upside down. It hasn't yet proved a problem, but I would have more confidence had it been designed to allow the weight of the unit to secure the holder in the keyway of the receiver.Best thing so far is that it works, and battery drain on the AAA's seems minimal."
2,Refreshing,"I love Blink's old sound. Which is exactly the reason I am happy that they kept it in about 50% of this CD. You will hear the good ole Blink 182 such as ""Feeling This"", ""Obvious"", ""Down"", ""Go"", ""Always"" etc. However, I like their new sounds just as much. ""Stockholm Syndrome"" is amazing and ""All of This"" is probably the best song Blink 182 has ever published. In the end I would buy this CD if only for ""All of This"". People who don't like the song don't respect the origin of bands like Blink 182, because this is very retro to the kind of music Blink claims to like themselves."
2,Thanks Keli!,I prefer the step workout on this tape to any aerobics I've done in college classes. I've been doing this routine three times a week for about seven months now and have lost all the weight I gained in my last pregnancy plus about fifteen pounds. Her moves can be a little hard to catch on to but if you do the routine a few times you should get them.
2,"Pricey, but worth it.","This is a very light hold product; not for anything going up. I use it in combinations with medium hold products to achieve very soft styling's. This stuff lasts a while, so don't be put off by the price. It also smells great, unlike a lot of cheaper hairsprays."
1,Mxpx is no more. . . .,"Mxpx used to be my favorite band until they started to turn more ""poppy"" sounding, getting worse on every cd since ""The Ever Passing Moment"". I along with many others, I am sure, would like to see a return of the old Mxpx with it's older easy going punk sound. I was really dissapointed to find out that this was only a compiliation cd, because I was really hoping for a turn around on their part. If you like the old Mxpx, try the new sideband of Blink 182, Box Car Racer. It's a great cd, and you can get it edited too for lyrics."
1,"Uhhh, where did this DVD come from?","The photos on the cover are of a little girl Hayley Mills and an old man John Hurt. In the movie they are roughly the same age: supposed to be college age.This edition of the movie is recorded from TV or someone's video tape. It's a homemade job. Guess that's why it's only $5.The movie is reminiscent of Never Cry Wolf and other movies of one man alone in the wilderness. Hayley Mills is in about 1/3 of the movie but most of the time she and John Hurt are apart (he's off bonding with the penguins).It's a sort of strange movie, but kind of fun to see. It was interesting to see that John Hurt really was young once upon a time. The time he spent with the penguins was pretty interesting, but don't get the idea that this is a romance. It's mostly a nature film. Maybe worth the $5, maybe not."
2,Good walking harness.,"Pros:* Easy to get on dog* Easy to adjust* controls dog pulling behavior* made of durable materialCons:* does not seem to correct pulling behavior* you may become dependent on this one walking your dog, and not correct the problem.We purchased this one is to use our German shepherd dog. It was somewhat of a nightmare to walk him when he was a pup, and this harness made it much easier."
2,Gentle Journeys into Nostalgia,"This collection of stories represent a longing for a gentler, simpler time. Each explores the elements of ""what might have been"", whether it be in the protagonist's own life, or the difference of ages.One story explores what might have been, if a man had made different choices in his own life and through that journey, he finds contentment in the life he did choose.Another explores trust and what might have been if only modern man could learn to believe. How much can be lost because we cannot.Others deal with the link that places and things may have with our past and the wonder of discovering such links.Taken together, the anthology offers something for all . . . nostalgia, philosophy, near future 'end of the world' scenarios, etc. This collection is not for the hard science fiction reader, but for the gentle reader who dares to ask ""what if""."
2,Works Great,"After 2 months of daily usage, the kettle works great. It's simple to use and has a sturdy metal feel, given the low price. I know that I haven't used the kettle long enough to write a detailed review, but so far I haven't see any signs of rust, loose parts, leaks, power failures, shocks, etc. I looked at few expensive kettles ($60 to $100), and decided to go with this highly rated product. You can also find it at Target, if you want to see how it feels. I haven't noticed any issues with the handle getting hot( as some people have mentioned ). However, the metal will get very hot ( but that's expected with all kettles )Suggestions- Maybe the outside of the kettle can have a heat strip that will turn red when the kettle has hot water."
2,Great service,The book I ordered was received promptly and in the perfect condition that was advertised.
1,Anything with Rosie is doomed,Every guy's cartoon fantasy in Betty Rubble went up in flames and crashed into the ground after this was released. Couldn't they have found Uma Thurman or Anna Nicole Smith?
2,A Good Freebie,"OK so I found this free on Amazon, but I read a lot of free books and average 2 or 3 stars rarely 5 stars. This is a harrowing tale of mass murder and definitely is not for the squeamish as it is quite brutal in parts. However saying that, if you enjoy thrillers it is a good story. I agree with some of the readers'comments regarding technical points, that for instance an attorney for the defence wouldn't be allowed to walk all over a crime scene etc., but that doesn't take away from the story. Although I understood the ending I also thought we should have had a reaction from Teddy to Nash's disclosure, it did leave it hanging in the air. I certainly thought it was worth more than 1 or 2 stars and I am not a friend of the author nor was I paid to write a good review. Would I have bought it and regretted it, not if it was a reasonable price."
2,What a voice!,"Susan is an amazing singer. She could be a clone of Janis Joplin, her voice is so strong and amazing! If you are a fan of Blues, then you need to add this C.D. to your collection. You won't be disappointed. Play it loud, using the biggest speakers you can find, dance and sing along. I think she should have won the Grammy instead of that Cristina Aguilara person, but with her talent Susan will still take the world by storm. There will be other chances to win a Grammy."
1,Bogus,"I ordered this CD and expected it in a short period of time, per the ad. After three months, I was notified that Amazon could not locate the item, and my order was cancelled. That same day I saw the same item on Amazon, ""available for shipping in 1-2 business days"" at 5 to 6 times the price when I ordered it."
1,Not happy,"I do not believe the quality is as good as the original product that came in our TV. Ever since this light was installed, our TV as had bright blue lights in the bottom corners of the screen."
2,Excellent,"This package is a total treat for Magazine fans. Some might look at this collection and think that they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel but actually I would call this the best collection of Magazine's material, even better than any of their albums. The track selection is excellent and the sound is as well (live tracks etc.). Fan of Magazine? Save some bucks and pick this one up; its an amazing collection from one the very best post-punk bands and one of the most interesting footnotes in rock history."
2,a.m. and p.m. yoga,"Have used this product for years. Started with the old video; have used the dvd since it came out, now on 2nd one. If is my favorite for a quick stretch & meditation starter."
2,This business truly started as a dream,"These two gentlemen who started The Home Depot had been executives at another home center company, but when they were fired and a friend pushed them to start Home Depot, they truly had nothing, but an idea, a dream. They really had no money, and had to go out and find it. For anyone who has ever had to do that to start your own business, believe me it ain't easy! I know I did it!. Read this story, you won't be sorry!"
2,Awesome!!,"I LOVE these. They look good on anyone who tries them on. They are also UV400, so they help protect your eyes. I've also noticed that when I wear them driving at night, they help dull the blinding glare of headlights.These are fairly high quality for their price. The lenses are easy on the eyes.One interesting thing to note is that the black glasses are larger than the red ones. I ordered both, but the red ones are too tight on my face. A pity."
2,Good information on astrology and interpretation,"I purchased this book about a year ago at a local used bookstore. I already have many other astrology books that have been published within the last 7 years, but this book was written in 1960, now for the pros and cons.Pros: offers more in depth information on each planet, aspect and house location. (there is information in this book that does not exist in any of the other books I have)Cons: sometimes the information is overwhelming so you have to reread sections of the book.Two thumbs up overall"
2,great cookbook,"As my daughter says, anything you might want to make is in this book. It is a great reference cookbook to find recipes for things you already know about, but dont know how to make. It is heavily referred to in our family."
1,Parts don't fit...,"When trying to assemble this kit, the holes in the wheels (all three wheels) were not large enough to allow the axle to fit through, thus preventing us from even completing the project. The instructions were also not that clear. There is more to making this kit work than just putting parts together, so if you are looking for something quick and easy, pass on this one."
1,Dull & poorly written!,This is an extremely simplistic historical outline that is very poorly organized & written. DO NOT BUY IT!
1,Didn't last long,This thing lasted about 8 months and then stopped working. I would expect a lot more for the price paid!
1,Sorry Pants..,"Ordered 9/19/11 received 10/4/11, No where in the write up did it state that it could come from Canada, the pants are tissue paper thin and are not acceptable for a man, much less someone who in handicapped. I am very upset that such a product would be offered, and the price is way too high for the product offered. I will sure rethink ordering from this company. what a rip off. Hope I don't have outrageous postage to return this item."
1,One of the saddest books I've read,"I bought this book, despite the distain I felt for its title, in the hope of some financial guidance. I found the advice given sound but simplistic. Put what you earn into assets and limit your liabilities. Very sound advice, but as the author admits the hard part is knowing the difference between the two. While reading this book a sad hollow feeling began to grow in my gut and I realized this book was more of a guide to a shallow life without passion for truly meaningful things. It's even sadder to think that it's a best seller and someone might actually use this book as a guide to life."
2,Perfect cover,I love this foundation it really covers without being too thick... The seller was fast to ship it and I couldn't be happier about this product... I will never buy a different foundation
2,GIVES PEACE OF MIND,"I am very happy with this product as it gives me assurance and peace of mind that all of my photos will last (at least) my lifetime on these discs (or so they promise). It has been difficult for me to locate any ""archival"" quality discs in local stores. Once I found out that other (cheaper/regular) discs may lose data over time, I freaked. I only found out about ""archival quality"" discs by accident on Amazon. After using them (and reading the description), I felt confident enough in these to actually ""delete"" several GIGS of yearly photo albums from my computer into my recycle bin AND then, permanently delete THAT from my computer! Now that's confidence! Anyone who knows me and my picture taking OBSESSION would be the first in line to buy these, if they needed them!"
2,Be a witness,"What a perfect setup for an Eve Dallas case. Roarke and Eve are attending the opening performance of the play ""Witness for the Prosecution,"" a production financed by Roarke. He is fascinated watching Eve see her first play and try to unravel the plot. When the lead female performer in the play stabs the lead male performer as per script, Eve realizes the play is suddenly off script and that's real blood. She's become a witness to the crime, along with Dr. Mira who was also in the audience.This is an interesting who dun nit given they know who killed the actor but Eve has to figure out who substituted the prop knife for the real thing. All of the suspects are playing a role and it's difficult to determine who's in character and who's for real. There is also a classic, memorable scene where Eve tries to do something romantic for Roarke for a change. That scene alone makes reading this story worthwhile...it is hilarious.This is another solid entry in the In Death series."
2,"Simple, cute pattern","This is our second child and we did not have a theme in mind except to get something for a girl. The price on this item was great and it even included a diaper stacker and a valance, something you do not get in most other bedding sets without paying a higher price. The soft pink stripe pattern is something that can easily blend with something else. Allover, a great item and good quality."
1,Wrecked,The other bad reviews have pretty much said it all. I can only add that it was a total waste of my hard earned money.
2,Its an ok book...if your 10,"I first read this book when I was about 11 or 12. I liked it but it's what I consider an easy read. If your a younger reader then its fine for you and you can't put it down. If your my age, then your like this is so predictable."
1,DOWNHILL,"SLADE is already downhil in this album, recorded in 1983. The hit ""MY OH MY"" is a shame, so cheesy it is. They tried to write an anthem. Anyway, Holder, Lea, Hill and Powell still can deliver some good old rockin, and the CD is not totally bad."
2,So good so far....,"Good item. Helps for my computer for when I want to go from headphones to speakers. Now I don't have to unplug my speakers to listen to my headphones. I bought some Scosche IDRM400m with it and only problem I have with this setup is that, if I plug in the headphones ALL the way in the sound doesn't sound as good. So I have to BARELY move them out a little for it to sound like it should. So if you have those headphones just remember that."
1,didn't work,My dad has bad feet and we were so hopeful that these would allow him to use his brace and have nice shoes. Not the shoes fault but we had to return them.
1,Cheap but bad taste,"I've taken a bunch of different brands of HTP. Most of them taste mildly earthy and plant-like. This one tastes chemically and gross. You would think that you wouldn't need to worry about the taste of a pill but I guess it's technically the smell that's bad because all you can truly taste is the capsule coating. That being said, the pennies you save by buying primaforce htp is only worth it if you don't value your personal experience. Splurge a few pennies so you don't take a hundred crappy-tasting pills. For the record, I finished the bottle, but I will never buy this brand again."
1,At 37 cents this book still costs too much,"This is the bible of the Republican party, excess, greed and stupid making -- the stock market will go up and up and up and up and the party will never stop! Glad i gots money and you don't. suck that poor people and by the way, you don't get health care either. funny now the geniuses that wrote this drivel will head up the george bush ""think tank"" -- hard to think when you brain is made out of avocado (not to tarnish avocados, i love them). I hope they lost all their money!"
1,disappointing,"After seeing the prior movie with the joker, this one was too predictable, felt too simple, rushed, and too much of the filiming was in the dark. I can't recommend it, wait for it to be free."
1,"Our Toy Talks, Does Not Chirp","The toy parrot we received did not chirp as described, but instead says, ""Polly want a cracker?"". Unfortunately, we bought this for a dog that loves to chase the birds in the yard and we thought having a toy that chirped would be fun. Of course, this is a toy parrot, and saying something like ""Polly want a cracker?"" would be a more typical thing for a parrot to say. I only wish the description was accurate."
1,What Happened?,"This was easily the most disappointing book I have read so far this year. Gibson is, or at least was, capable of better. Cayce Pollard was an interesting character in the beginning and had interesting possibilities but was not fully developed or explored.The book jumped around in search of a theme / purpose. There was Cayce's search for her father, which never went anywhere. There was the brief introduction to her mother, which never went anywhere. There was the main plot element in the book: ""the footage"" which again, never really went anywhere. In the end, the producers of the footage are found, and there is no point to any of it other than the fact that some people where making it and Cayce found them. No big revelation or hidden twist. Ummmm... OK.Save yourself the money and don't read this. Seriously, it just isn't worth the time or money with so many other good books out there."
1,"It really sucked. Trust me, it really did. Deserves a 0","Not only was the book unnecessary, it was costly for what basically was just the storyline of the game retold in a very sorry fashion. It was pathetic, really. There were a few thoughts and observations that weren't in the Computer game, but only a few. I mean there were some obervations made of Makala that weren't made in the game, and a little more info about the plot, but it was still not worth making a book out of. If you're going to continue producing books with such low quality, I suggest you hand the torch over to someone else that appreciates the characters you have come to care less about. In the future, I would suggest more Pug and less characters that will you'll never see again once the book is over."
1,Walking Away Dissapointed,"I had great hopes for this book, although i knew the dead would start ""walking"" i realized that they were not the Romero Zombies, or the Living dead of the zombie genre of today. Still i thought the idea of Dead people just pacing around doing nothing was still very creepy. The plot started out strong, the story within the story was pretty good, but when it came down to it the great evil running the show was pretty cheesy and quite frankly the way they deal with it was anticlimatic and elementary. I was more afraid of grandpa walking at the bottom of the lake then what made grandpa start walking in the first place."
2,Very nice,The pendant has alot of class it is not too big it is rather small if your looking for a large pentagram this is not for you but it is well made and discreet.I would advise to buy the chain from silver insanity too so it all arrives in the same delivery .
2,Great music,"Another CD I used to have, and went missing. Glad I could replace this one because it was one of myfaves"
1,Smells like warm vomit,I bought this flavor for the first time and tossed it.Once I added water and smelled it I almost vomited. The smell of this soup is just like warm vomit.
1,Not what I expected....,"When I saw Off Da Hook Hip Hop Aerobics for sale I purchased it right away...I had been waiting for a workout tape with some flava to it. But after watching it once, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. There are some dance moves that may work out parts of your body but I didn't feel the 'aerobics' part of the workout at all. Definitely not a workout for people that are really trying to lose weight....maybe if you just want to get your body warmed up with some dance moves. But don't bring these dance moves to the club...Also, the music was not the hip hop that I expected. Overall, I think this workout lacks professionalism and did not give me the workout that I expected."
2,Tasty EASTERN North Carolina BBQ,"For those who don't know, BBQ truly means only one thing - pork, cooked real slow and flavored with a vinegar based sauce. Please, don't ever use the word barbeque for a gril or say you are having a barbeque when you are really just having a cookout. King's does a good job of representing Eastern North Carolina BBQ and they ship it fast. We live in Seattle now (2003) and have ordered from Kings our last two Fourth of July celebrations. The BBQ reheats well and impressed all the folks here in Seattle. Order several dozen hushpuppies and keep the toaster oven on to heat them up a few at a time. The only thing King's is really missing is the added flavor of real wood fire. Wilbur's in Goldsboro is still cooking their hogs out back in a pit with real wood. The pig tastes a bit better when it has been slow cooked in a smoky pit. Y'all be good now, ya hear!"
1,Not helpful to me,"The content was very simplistic - I didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Also, the book is rife with typos and grammatical errors. That made me question the book's credibility; especially considering the topic is book publishing."
1,Low quality phone with a big price tag,"Less than 8 months after I purchased this phone, all of the number buttons stopped working and I already had to purchase a new battery. Luckily, the one year warranty was still in effect so I was able to return it to the company and they sent me a new one. We had the new one for about 4 months when all of the number buttons stopped working on it and the battery needed replaced once again!!!! This was a very expensive phone and the quality is terrible. Because of this experience, I will never purchase another motorola phone again, and I will advise others against purchasing motorola products."
2,This really works !,"What a great video! My family sat around the tv and we had a great time watching this movie. The kids have seen it a dozen times and keep watching it over and over. And, yes, the3 dogs watched it as well. They were glued to the set with the animal sounds and the terrier went up to the tv and barked at it !!"
2,slammin',the CD is classic Chris Rock material. Great delivery and funny as hell. I laughed my butt off. Defintely get this one!
1,Instapark Dual Garage Door Laseer,This item did not work for my 2 car garage application. I mounted the unit about even with the hood of the car. When I pulled the car in it didn't detect the montion. I have 9' ceilings. i then mounted it about even with the front door of the car. The unit now comes on but by the time you have reached the area you are parking the lasers have gone out. Being that there is no way to adjust the time on the lasers or the sensitivity of the motion I would not reccomment this unit.
2,"If you haven't seen Evangelion, you havent seen anime...","Neon Genesis Evangelion can best be described as THE BEST ANIME SEREIES OTHER THAN LOVE HINA. I myself have all eight DVDs and wish I bought them in this...package.Shinji Ikari is just a normal kid, except his mom is dead, he now lives with his guardian Misato Katsuragi, he pilots a giant mech called an Evangelion, he works for NERV which is in the process of trying to protect the planet, and his dad Gendo, is the head of this organization. It seems that in 2000, a giant explosion at the southpole, 2nd impact, has flooded much of the world and killed like 1/3rd the human race. On top of that, huge indestructable creatures called Angels are starting to attack.The series is so incredable cool, even near the end were the sereis goes all psycological. As the title states, if you haven't seen Eva, you haven't seen anime.-schwinn-"
1,Love,"Waterloo Industry at work. The British are cute,or tough, and winners, whatever. It doesn't matter that they failed with invasion in 1806, they failed with invasion on Walcheren, that they failed in Spain in 1809, 250-mile desperate retreat before Napoleon, and a hurried embarking in La Coruna,a la Dunkirk! It doesn't matter that they lost at Talavera, it doesn't matter that Ney inflicted higher casualties on Wellington, than his own at Quatre Brass. It doesn't matter that Wellington messed up his concentration in 1815 despite of being the best informed of all commanders. Wellington is untouchable, and shining like a holy Madonna.Author goes orgasmic about the British.French, Russians, Austrians, Prussians?-I don't feel the love."
2,A Game of Shadows,A good second story to the Sherlock Holmes. Good movie effects. Actors are as great as in the first movie.
1,Management tips on a 3rd grade reading level,"Hands down, this is one of the most ludicrious books I have ever picked up.I was a little miffed when I opened the box and realized what I'd paid $11.95 plus postage for, but that was nothing. The print is large-some of the pages are only half full. What this an attempt to draw out what should have been a booklet? Or maybe not printed at all? The behavioral modifications presented can be picked up easily-positive reinforcement gets better results than punishment-how new is that idea? Or how about ""clearly communicate goals""? Good grief. If this is truly the state of management today I think I'll take my master's in psychology, write a repetitive, inane book and make a fortune. If your IQ is above 75, skip this."
2,This Book is Wonderful!!,"I found this book to be so romantic in the telling of Paul and Alex's love story. And it was also one of the saddest books I've ever read. It's about love and loss and dealing with all the things that come in between. And yes, the dog in the story is so sweet and I was on the edge of my seat hoping and praying everything would turn out okay. I loved this book and am all the better for having read it. It's also one of the most heartwrenching books I've ever read. Just wonderful"
2,This book was like a vacation: short but worth the trip!,This was the first book that I read where I wanted a highlighter! Pearl's writing was fantastic: both catchy and original. She made Idlewood as well as the residents of this small town more interesting than any big city! She also made living with HIV more real for those unfamiliar with it's effects. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading comprehensive socio-political fast-paced stories told well!
2,THIS RULES THE HOUSE!,This album is awesome! 100/10 for every single song! We need anothe r Green Day album for 2006! I hope thay play punk rock until they're like 50 or something
1,Don't buy it!,"I purchased two M250's for my children. Both kids commented on how cumbersome the operating software was but appreciated having a reasonable-priced MP3 player-- until *both* units failed within six months of purchase! We contacted Sansa customer support when the first one died, and they informed us that they would send a replacement out as it was under warranty. SIX WEEKS after Sansa acknowledged receiving the defective unit, they claimed that the RMA authorization had lapsed (we sent the unit in promptly). Caveat emptor-- if this unit seems inexpensive, it's because it is flimsy and badly supported. Buy an Ipod or *anything* other than a Sansa. My three year old Rio S35 has been a more reliable performer than these M250's. Run, don't walk, from these units, if our experience with their reliability or customer support is any indication."
1,Not His Best,"This is simply average. Although I found some of the stories entertaining, it was hard to stay motivated to keep reading the entire book."
1,I should have known better,"I was not expecting miracles. I got these for sore spots, not wornout knees for which I take meloxicam and tramadol XL. I just thought maybe this patch would help my shoulder that is a little stiff by the end of the day. Of course, it smells strongly of menthol and camphor--two primary ingredients, but I was prepared for that. It said leave on for no more than 8 hours. Pretty soon, my shoulder became warm enough that it occupied my thoughts, and then was distracting. After four hours, I peeled off the patch and my shoulder felt better than it had since patch was put on--because it was gone. This will be no help in the family medicine chest, but I have 119 patches left over."
2,Seems to be a good filter,"This filter is reliable and lasts a decent amount of time (several weeks, 1-2 quarts of water/day). Compared to the expensive Pur filter, this one lasts a lot longer, though it's not exactly clear how clean the water gets. Anyway the water tastes fine, and we've been happy and healthy using it so far."
2,Clearly a have-to-have book,"I picked up this book, intrigued that the reviews were so different - one star versus five stars. I did not know what to expect, but after many days of reading, I clearly believe that this is a have-to-have book if you are seriously thinking about developing your own commodity trading systems. It may be too simple for some people, but the methodology is sound, and concise, and I believe the people who panned this book were jealous."
1,Just Showboatin',"Who the heck does this guy think he is? I'd like to give him a country butt whoopin' for making me waste my money on this claptrap. Ok, I laughed once. Maybe twice. Not real laughs, just snickers. And not loudly."
2,Topeak TourGuide Handle Bar Bag DX,"When we moved our daughter from a baby seat to a Novara Afterburner we had to remove the rear rack on our Wildwood Tandem. But we still needed to take along some gear on our bike rides. The Topeak TourGuide Handle Bar Bag DX has proven to be more than an adequate solution. The mounting instructions are not too difficult to follow, and there is an ingenious system with a cable that wraps around your handlebars and prevents the bag from sinking down.This bag has two main compartments, a couple of side compartments, a rain cover, and a clear plastic holder for a ride map. All and all it is a very useful piece of equipment and I highly recommend it."
1,strange material on this american apparel shirt,"the fit and the style of this shirt were fine, but there was something weird about the material. it's like a super rough cotton and something about it always makes me kind of itchy. unfortunate because it looks cute enough. i wear it from time to time but can't recommend it."
1,Not Quite enough,"A little too loud, 250W Heat Lamp insufficient for our application - replaced with a Panasonic .7 sones, 1500W Heater, 100 CFM"
1,Not what is pictured!,"IF you order this product, you will receive a bag of ""Small World Rabbit Food"" [...]When contacted, this seller does not address why the picture is of MannaPro Pro food, some of the best food on the market. Only says, it's by the same company.That's great and all, but this is a bait and switch!DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!"
2,This Television is AMAZING!!!,"I received the TV in less than a week and I set it up and all I can say is that it is Amazing. I hooked it up to my surround system and the picture is up there with the high priced sony's, toshiba's and mitsubishi. My brother has a mitsubishi 65 and paid over 3 times what I did from mine and the pictures is the same quality. The only thing that bothered me ws having to switch between all the available inputs to switch between dvd and tv, but I got a Harmony remote and programmed it via their website and now with a push of a button it will switch everything automatically(that remote rules). I would definitely recommed this tv and with the money you save you can get a better surround system."
2,Steven's 2 cents,"I use these gloves for a water filled Heavy bag. The gloves do fine with my lite work out of 20 minutes, if you stay on the bag longer you may need 2 pairs.Recommended"
2,couldn't be happier,"I've had it for about two years now, and this 80gb drive never quits on me. This Lacie Mobile Drive is no thicker than a deck of cards, and about the same proportions as a dollar bill (though it cost me about 80 of them, thanks to an in-store rebate).The box included a power cable, but I'm using it mostly on recent Windows XP machines, and they're mostly USB 2.0 compliant, so it is always sufficiently powered up.The metallic finish never shows a scratch, and I've thrown it into my soft sided briefcase so many times, I'm amazed it hasn't gotten scratched already!Thank you, LaCie, for making a device that works well and looks nice too!"
2,I happened to like the book!,"I noticed that quite a number of people were complaining about the quality of The Butlerian Jihad. Many are saying that it can't hold a candle to the original books. My response to that is at least the damn thing is readable! I've read the first four Dune books and the characters are severely two dimentional. The futuristic babbling is to Dune what technobabble is to Star Trek. At least Star Trek uses it effectively. They've never had a whole episode dedicated to it. While reading the Dune series I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters! I have no idea why people have declaired this one of the greatest sci-fi series ever. I find the Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Andersen novels more rich and alive than any of the original Dune novels. If you want a good read, I recommend The Butlerian Jihad."
1,Incorrectly advertised,"I purchased this 2-way radio to use in my office. I need the 38 CTCSS subcodes per channel, since we are near a highway and frequently get interference from other users. Though Amazon.com indicated this unit had this capability, it did not. I now must go to the trouble of returning it. I would not have ordered this 2-way radio if representation of this product's features were correct."
2,far fetched but a good scare,"Just one more jason movie. Part 9 is a good one but also quite different. Now, when has jason ever transfered bodies ? He uses different victims' bodies to get around in this one. The actress Kari Keegan does a pretty fine job in acting as jason's distant blood relation. There are a couple of scenes in which this movie gets pretty disgusting. Especially in the freaky diner scene in which jason uses Kari Keegan's hot shot boyfriend's body to kill quite a few people. All in all, a good movie for a scare. If you are constant with the jason movies be all over this !"
1,Not great...,"I bought this lamp because my halogen lamp put out so much heat, it was nearly unusable. I wanted something that I could put a CF bulb into to save on heat production (and energy usage). The price was a big selling point, and it looked good enough in the pictures.This lamp isn't very well made. The connection between the base and the arm is very loose (wobbles side-to-side, back and forth, and rotates with barely any force at all. Also, the switch (built into the back of the head) is very flimsy and doesn't fit on the head straight.I'm keeping it, but only because I need a lamp that I can use and don't want to spend over $100 on one--but I'm not happy."
1,Waste!!,"What a waste of time and money. This does not work. After 45 minutes I didn't even have one thigh done and still had to shave it. It is being returned!!! Don't waste your money, use a razor."
2,"This one is a ""Keeper""","Books that I want to keep as part of my library are few and far between, however, this one is definetely one of those."
1,Disappointing for a true Tebow fan,"This documentary was a major disappointment for someone who is a true Tebow fan. There was no new information, no new stories, and there weren't even any interviews with Tim, his family, or those closest to him. There were interviews with a couple reporters, a high school football teammate and assistant coach, amongst others. It seemed as if the film company didn't have rights to use a lot photos or video of Tim as there were actors pretending to be Tim playing football. My husband and I have followed Tim for years and were excited that there was a new video, however we almost had to laugh at how bad it was. Glad we only spent $7 on this. I guess you get what you pay for though!"
1,died after a week.,"Not much to say, mine died after a week. I am going to contact san disk to see if they can rma it."
2,Best book ever!!!,"This is THE best book ever! It was my son's favorite book when he was a little boy...he is now 20 years old! I bought it as a baby boy shower gift and one for my 5 month old granddaughter, too. It won a Caldecott Award and the kids love to read it over and over and over again! Highly recommend!"
2,Perfectly relaxing and yet equally cool,Fantastic CD- helps me to unwind after a very long day. CD #2 is where it's at - track 2 is my new theme music for life. An absolutely beautiful collection...
2,Oustanding collection,"This album was a must-have for me because of all the tracks in general and one in particular. It is also a well-made album with very good acoustic quality. ""Time in a Bottle"" is a special song for my wife and I. So is ""I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song""; and there are other favorites on this and other albums. In January 2011 we celebrated our 40th Anniversary with dinner at Croce's Restaurant in San Diego. (Owned by his widow Ingrid. If you are a Jim Croce fan and in or visiting San Diego, going here should be at or near the top of your to-do list.)"
1,COME ON!,"OK, come on Janet E., let's get some maturity going with Stephanie! How many times does her life have to be threatened for her to remember her gun?"
1,Poor plotline with many holes in it.,"This book was very disappointing. The plot was non-existent and the dialogue one-dimensional. I thought pages had fallen out of my book at the end because I couldn't believe the way the murderer was revealed, with absolutely no analysis of or connection to the clues. It seemed that the author decided that she had written enough pages to satisfy her editor, so she just said ""It's obvious to everyone that the murderer is [X]."", and then ended the book with another silly scene between Kip and Lauren. I usually look forward to the next book in a series, but I was not sorry to read that she has no plans to add to this series. Maybe she'll spend her free time going to some writing classes."
1,Not Scary,This story did have a twist to the end but it was corny and made me wonder why I read the book in the first place. The end really messes the story up...
1,*garbage*,"Nelly is a GIMMICK, if you're looking for a ""talented"" rapper my suggestion is Eminem, heck I give him 1 star because I can't give him less than that. He sells a million records, but then again so did Millie Vanillie and Rico Suave!"
2,Awesome Book,"This book is an absolute must have for any cooking enthusiast, especially those who are still collecting their kitchen gear. Alton Brown goes into great detail as to what kinds of things you will need for a myriad of situations, and why he likes each item. It has everything from what pots to use to what kinds of thermometers you'll need. If you enjoy watching Alton Brown's show, you will definitely like this book as it is infused with his wit and humor and most importantly, his knowledge! I highly recommend this book!"
1,Not so wrangler carpenter jeans,"My first purchase from amazon because of a gift certificate I was given. I brought the wrangler jeans for quite a bit more I can buy the same brand at Target.. The quality was less than that of Target too. Material was thinner, the zipper feels like it's going to break everytime I use it. So I'm not very happy with my purchase to say the least... It makes wary of order anything from Amazon.. I still have 73.oo or so left on my card. I'm looking for some tennis shoes but wonder if I'm going to pay more and get less in quaility.. Disappointed and not recommending Amazon even telling people of my experience.. :-( my usual wrangler have lasted quite a long time. So well see how long they last..."
1,Prometheus,"bad acting, poor script.not worth the money.not worth the money.not worth the money.not worth the money"
2,My first Durutti Column purchase..this one is a keeper...,"Wow. Someone Else's Party just showed up on my doorstep today. I was captured by Requiem for Mother on Radio Paradise and bought this album on a whim (I trust RP's judgement immensely)...I am VERY happy...I can tell this is going to be one that just keeps spinning and spinning. I am new to Durutti Column/Vini Reilly but can tell that I will be listening to all I can find - this music just completely defies categorization...somebody called it offbeat and trippy - which definitely apply. The guitar playing is just sublime and masterful...and unlike ANYTHING I've heard come out of a chunk of wood and some steel strings before...classical, flamenco, rock influences all around, but blended with clearly virtuoso talent. Wow. This one is special."
1,Horrible!!,"I had high expectations of this product, my floors are all hardwood and I hate to see dust in it. I use this every single day and after 2 weeks eventhough I was using the tools to clean it, it started to have everything around the bristles ( specially hair) and stop working soon after that. It's almost imposible to remove the things that get attached to the bristles!!! I would never buy this again!!!"
1,All sounds the same,All the songs sound basically the same - whining voice over a fairly good sound track.
2,great product,I've been testing my nuvi 350 all around the Los Angeles and Ventura County area in California. So far I'm happy with the product although I did occasionally have weird bugs. I tested it to and from work about five times to see if I wanted to keep the product. Four times it worked great and took me right to the location without any issues. One time though it told me I had arrived when I was still about half a mile away. I then searched for POI. The database is good but is missing some businesses that have been around for over a year. I was able to quickly find tons of useful POI though. However one time the unit had GPS reception and it thought Glendale CA was 300 miles away from me when really Glendale is about 25 miles away from me. So in conclusion I like the unit and will definitely keep it but once in awhile it does weird things.
1,wrong dvd,"we ordered both vol. 3 and vol. 4 of the AccelerRacers.although the packaging on both the case and disk of vol. 3 said it was Breaking Point, the actual movie was Ultimate Race which is vol. 4. My son did not let me know this before it was past time to return the product , so we are stuck with 2 copies of vol. 4.check your copy when you receive it to make sure it is the correct volume."
2,Honda Spare Tire Cover,"This was delivered promptly, fit very well, was priced right, and is of good quality. What more could anyone want"
2,Good Charlotte ROX!!,"GC Rox!. This album is better than their 1st.The songs are awesome!! They each have a different beat and none of them are the same. The cd is worth listening to.Believe ME! ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" is a great single and the video is off the hook!! My fav. songs are ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" and ""Hold On"".The band is original & their the best ever!!So if u don't have the CD then u NEED to go OUT and BUY IT!GC keep Rockin' On!"
2,"Everything is funny, but Stan.","You'd have to go pretty far to find a more devoted Laurel and Hardy fan than I, but as I watched this great collection I realized that Stan wound up exactly where he belonged, behind the camera. The gags are funny, but they could have been done by any other able bodied comedian of the time. He HAD no character, and that is precisely the problem. I still gave this set 4 stars because the prints are gorgeous, the films are fun, and they are definitely worth preserving (KINO does an amazing job). My only negative comment has to do with Stan himself...who, if he wanted to continue as a performer, really needed Ollie a lot more than I'd realized. As for Ollie, well, he more than likely would have continued as a wonderful comic supporting character actor, just as Eugene Pallete did (another Roach veteran)."
2,I only wish this was not the end.,The Killing ended after this second season. That was the worst part about this series. My husband and I watched the first season on Netflix's but they did not have the second season so we purchased it from Amazon. Thank you Amazon for allowing us to know how this story ended and exactly who the killer was or killer(s) were.
2,Expensive,"A valuable book in this field. Better and fuller text than most Quimper books. Along with the average color photos, there is a broad and useful appendix of many small b&w photos. A good addition to any faience library, but -- it is too expensive, even through Amazon.com! Publisher, get real!"
2,Excellent sealed cans,"I'll be honest here, the fit was a little tighter than I am used to and took me a couple of weeks to get used to. I was very impressed by the amount of noice they block out, even when no music is being played. I feel I am listening to a very clean version of the music with little outside disturbances and noise.The long cord, high quality jack adapter, and adjustability of the head phones are among the perks that add to the enjoyment of the product.The (only) downside was the plastic head band which develops cracks and then falls apart. Mine lasted 2 years and 4 months before I started to notice cracking and then a matter of months before parts started to fall off.I most likely will purchase another pair as I had over two great years and have not found their equal in a sealed can. But if they would simply make the band of spring steel, I'd pay double for a then perfect set of sealed cans!"
2,A thoroughly delightful read!,"I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could, it was so much fun to read. I was pleasantly surprised at every turn and just thoroughly enjoyed this book! Nonnie St.George has a great sense of humor and for a first book, plot, characters and dialogue were all excellent. I look forward to reading more of her books and with a bit of polish, I'm sure her next ones will all be 5 star rated."
2,Absolutely perfect costume for Star Wars Fan!,"Thank you my son was begging to be a trooper for Halloween. Thanks for the low price on this costume, we made a little boy very happy."
2,fits good a bit expensive,"It fits my vacuum, but I found one at the store for about $1-$2 (7-8 dollars) cheaper. Not a huge difference, but dollars add up."
1,New formula ruined the product,"We have been using CB products for years including lotions, sunscreens, shampoo, bug spray and etc.... The super sensitive lotion has been the only lotion to use on my son, who has bad eczema. However, this new formula totally ruined it. It has a very weird bad strong smell that makes me sick, and it's like a patch of glue that does not moisturize the skin at all... We will stay away from CB products now and need to find some good alternatives to use....."
1,Bit dissapointed about the product,"I'm a bit dissapointed about the product because in the specifications didn't said that the ""Battery On Board"" CANNOT BE REPLACED. Either in the webpage... I thought I could...And what will happened when the battery on board died? Do we need to trash the entire equipment? What will happen with the enviroment?I sent an email to SolarStyle and they answered me the following:-The battery in the SC002 cannot be replaced or removed-So take this into consideration...Brgds,Cesar"
1,WHAT WAS THE POINT?,"This (and I say it with all I can muster)""Movie"" is possibly the worst movie I've seen in the past 25 years. It was all based on a lie. I grew up in the town next to Des Plaines/Norwood Park, IL. Where John Wayne Gacy Lived and burried his victims. I remember when the crime happened and watching the news every night for the new body count. The house was demolished at the end of the digging process and a patch of grass eventually covered his lot. There was NEVER A SECOND HOUSE BUILT. That's where the story becomes incredibly stupid. This movie is laughable. They want you to think it's the old house but remind the viewers every few minutes that it's a new house. This movie was not creepy at all.Doors close by themselves, pictures fall off walls. This movie was so bad thatcompared to The Blair Witch Project, it's a student quality piece of poop."
1,Not realy a whitening soap so am not surprised it doesn't work,First of all the soap isn't a whitening soap but the label says makari clarifying exfoliating antiseptic soapwith no mentioning of the whitening part.I have been using it for a month with no effect except for my skingetting dry and having a white residue on my skin after my shower.It looks pretty weird on black skin so ihave to make sure i have an extra rinse after wards.Also my face keeps breaking out when i use it.
2,Surface and Symbol,"From Oscar Wilde's Preface to The Picture of Dorian Gray: ""Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.""A good pick for readers at both the middle-school level and the high school level, Lowry's prize-winning novel takes her audience beneath the surface of Jonas' world. When he begins to see beyond and beneath the perfect exterior of the Community, Jonas as well as the reader must make a difficult choice.This is a very good book to spark discussions about our society today, our future, and our choices. I would wholeheartedly recommend this book, especially in a classroom setting. Lowry's gifts of characterization, symbolism, and emotion make this a truly great find."
1,"very,very cheaply made",for the price i cant complain but this HDMI cable is the cheapest cable i have ever purchased..be prepared to buy supper glue because the plastic casings in the 2 inputs are very loose almost to fall out.other than that this cable works.....
2,Please release this video again.,"I lost my copy and want another one. It is a great, short yoga workout. Please publish it again."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT THAT I ORDERED,"I DID NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT THAT I HAD ORDERED, I HAD ORDERED ""ANGEL--CELESTIAL BODY LOTION"" WHICH WAS THE PRODUCT THAT WAS SHOWN ON LINE, WHAT I RECEIVED WAS ""ANGEL PERFUMING BODY LOTION"" NOT AT ALL WHAT I WANTED--SO I GAVE IT TO MY FRIEND, HAD TO ORDER FROM ANOTHER SITE TO GET THE CORRECT ORDER. VERY VERY DISAPOINTED--THE PRODUCT SHOWN WAS NOT THE PRODUCT SENT.IN THE FUTURE I WILL ORDER FROM THE OTHER SITE, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR SENDER SENDS OUT THE PRODUCT THAT IS ADVERTISED, AS THESE TWO PRODUCT ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER, MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, THIERRY MUGLER,,,BUT NOT THE SAME PRODUCT."
1,Not much Speakman here.........,Jeff is only in two scenes in this movie. The begining and the end. Kind of discouraging. No disrespect Gary.
2,Amazing Crackers!,"Even if I wasn't gluten free, I would LOVE these crackers. They are so flavorful and are good for you. Eating them plain is wonderful but they are to die for with almost any cheese. Try a smoked cheddar."
1,Could I be more bored?,The author is determined to write one cliche after another.The best I can say about this book is that it is boring.
2,No more frizzy hair!,"For my entire half century of life, I've been ""blessed"" with curly hair which morphs to piles of frizz in rainy, snowy or humid weather. Regular hand-held hair dryers never quite dried my very-thick hair and didn't prevent the frizz. This one not only dries my hair, but does so quickly and a lot more quietly than any other I've used. The best thing is that it really does reduce the FrizzFactor significantly. I won't claim it's completely gone, but having 90% less frizz is cause for celebration and a four-star rating. By the way, I live in ""HotLanta"" where frizzy-hair weather lasts longer than a Maine winter."
1,SHAME ON YOU MR. KEEL !!!,"Let me just start by saying that the "" MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is not a novel, nor is it a coherent story. It starts strong, just enough to draw you in, then it goes down the spectral energy crap hole. Were led to believe that Mr. Keel is a sensiable, unbiased investigator, when really he's a parinoid delusional whack. I'm only 15, and I don't buy a word of it!!! see the movie instead."
2,Definitely worth it,"This album is worth it for ""All She Could Ask For,"" if nothing else. That song is so beautifully haunting...it's nearly perfect."
2,Works VERY well and cleans up quick too!,"This is a gem! My 2 year old can't get enough rice so I figured it was time to find a way to make it and keep it ready to go for a solid day. This Zojirushi does the job quick and VERY well. Not only does it cook and keep rice ready to be eaten, it is also VERY easy to clean which is half the battle with any kitchen cooking machine. I am also amazed at all the other items it can cook too. Not the cheapest or the most expensive rice cooker out there, but it does what it says and the price is fair too. Oh, and it plays cute little songs when its done cooking (please don't tell my buddies I used the word ""cute"" ;) )..."
1,Bloody sunday,"Not really up to my expectation and I'm not impressed, there was no historical background on the Bloody Sunday, mainaction in the movie were streetfightings, killings etc. Would not recommend."
2,Perfect Coffee Maker,"I've had every different drip coffee maker under the sun, and they all fell short of my expectations in one way or the other. I finally decided to splurge on this model, and I couldn't be happier. My experience--unlike that of a previous reviewer--has been that it can make VERY strong coffee if so desired. I paired this with the Pro Line coffee grinder, and on a factory setting of 5.5, this makes as strong a coffee as I can imagine wanting. Also, it's dead simple to operate, makes a full 12 cup pot in under 10 minutes, and thanks to the design, cleanup is a breeze. I couldn't be happier. Oh, and it's built like a tank, so it will probably outlast me."
2,"Great style, easy installation, so-so air flow","This is a very stylish fan and installation was smooth and easy. The unit arrived unblemished save for a ding at the top of the canopy which was easily straightened with padded pliars. For the price, however, I would expect better air flow. With only three short blades, this fan does not move a whole lot of air, even at the high speed."
1,Could have been more,"I had heard that this book was a real gem, but when I got it and read it to my 5 year old, we felt there could have been a bit more humor. I guess we expected these to be more like Arnold's Parts and More Parts which are hysterical and highly entertaining."
1,Horrible Book,This is another example of someone just throwing a book together in order to call themselves an author. The drawings cannot be followed therefore the book is useless. Another wanabe master. Do yourself a favor and skip this book.
1,never again,"i wore this mostly as a wind break in the winter months. after 1 month daily and only one rainy day it leaked. pinholes were visible in the light and the seams are stitched upside down. for example, where the mat. meets on the chest, the lower fabric is sewed on top of (OUTSIDE) the upper. any water that runs down sits squarely on the seem allowing it to be absorbed through the threading instead of rolling off unencumbered. i really have zero idea how anyone could think that would be the way to make a rain suit. quite obvious this product was made without ANY knowledge or R&D;i would not recommend this for anything other than emergency wear, only for a short time, and even then you can expect small leaks. i wouldn't even call this a ""fog suit"" let alone rain.terrible product."
2,Rock n Roll Moroccan style!,"This album is completely sung in moroccan arabic and is truly a work of art. The instruments and musical style of this album is principally moroccan, but also reflecting other parts of the middle east. The songs are extremely long and at times monotonous, but if you have a taste for arabic music as I have you won't be disappointed. My favorite song in this album is Fata Morgana, it makes me want to dance. Inshalla, Sahara Eleckrik and Casablanca/Wacha Wacha are also great songs and can be a blast to dance to, especially if you like to dance to middle eastern music. This album is highly recommended if you like that kind of music as I do."
1,I thought this was a POWER tool,I wish there was a review of this item available before i bought it. The power behind this tool is extremely lacking to the point that there were some screws that were too much for it to drive but even my 10 year old daughter could screw in with a regular screwdriver. A serious waste of money.
2,Let Your Imagination Take Flight,"The book,""Dragon Wing"" is about a boy named Haplo who is sent from the Low Realm to bring back 2 people to preach his master's word, and one to serve as a dicsiple. It took me a while to get into the book, but once I did, I couldn't put it down.(During school I had to though.) This book is filled to the brim with fantasy, adventure, and suspense. A couple of times I lost cried for the characters. I feel that if more people read this book, they would like it as much as I did.....Maybe more. I don't know about you, but I'm not a person who likes to be told everything about a book, especially the ending. If you tell someone the end, what's the point of reading the whole book? Well, I will leave you with that. Have fun reading it if you choose to read ""Dragon Wing"" by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hicman."
2,Great little kit.,It's an SD kit. Don't expect unparalleled plastic colors or awesome articulations. It's fun for a small build when you're bored.
1,Battle of the media whores,"Wow, it's hard to know who's more of a fact-lite demagogue media whore. Now that we know the left has one to claim for their own, the world can rest easy. I've read this and Coulter's book. Why anyone should bother paying to view a high-priced cat fight is unclear. Of course, now that Judith Regan is out of a job, perhaps these one-off books will no longer be published, and both hags can go back to dissecting the news in either the LA Times or Fox News, whichever the case may be.Rest easy, moderate America. Gamera and Mothra will hopefully destroy each other soon. Let's hope they don't obliterate our country in the process."
1,Too slow!,"I received this swing as a shower gift and had considered exchanging it to begin with. Now I wish I had! My daughter has hated this swing ever since she was born. It is very uncomfortable for her to sit so upright and it swings so slow. Then you have boring toys and annoying music that repeats itself to often. The rocker when used on the floor isn't very good either, it seems to always want to tip forward. I would never suggest this swing to anyone.If you need to save space this swing and chair neither one fold up small at all.It's way too big and bulky."
1,Waste of time and money,"After reading encouraging reviews, I decided to buy two paint eater discs. I'm removing 3-4 layers of old paint off an old wrought iron fence. Each disc would literally last 10-15 minutes, rapidly melting away. It took a lot of effort to go through multiple coats of paint, since ""the eater"" would only slowly wear the paint off instead of shaving or grinding it. I only managed to clean 2 square feet of metal surface per each disc.Overall, Paint eater discs performed 5-10 times worse than inexpensive 4-1/2 inch grinding discs ($2-$3 each). I'm very disappointed. From my brief experience, if you need to remove one or two soft, relatively new coats of paint, or remove loose rust, then paint eater discs will do the job. On the other hand, the product is completely useless for removing multiple coats of hard, old paint."
2,in three words a grand finish,"this is by far and away the best book in this trilogy.alot of action,some tit for tat give and take,and more detail than the previous two books.I liked the reunion between luthien and his brother the most."
2,No Turning Back,"You will never, EVER hear a groove deeper than the one from ""Prelude."" Anyone else's efforts to label their music as ""heavy"" or ""funky"" in its wake just seem ridiculous after you go on this incredible 25-minute ride. There is no point in trying to be polite or tactful: you must blast this record at full force and remember, when your ears are still ringing two days later, why you had to do it. Traditional jazz afficionados are offended by this record and that's fine: it isn't jazz, anyway, it's Miles. If you love rock and roll, or funk, please put your prejudices on hold and let the groove take you away. This is by far the hardest-edged music ever made. The rest of the album's great, too. . .but ""Prelude"" is a sublime moment in music history and you must hear this record. Oh, and be forewarned: Pete Cosey's guitar solo is extremely obnoxious and will take some getting used to. Once you're there, though, it's the best part of the record."
1,Fell apart,Mine fell apart after just a month of use. The hinging mechanism is very flimsy and I don't think it can really handle the weight.
1,A mid-level good/bad flick,"Aliens come to earth, apparently needing better drapes for their uniforms. Celebrated/vilified as the worst movie ever made, it doesn't deserve that title (not if you've seen Red Zone Cuba, anyway) even if it does have oodles of fabulously wooden acting, as well as featuring director Wood's wife's chiropractor as the most unconvincing Bela Lugosi you ever saw."
1,"Didn't Love ""Love You Forever""","Okay, I admit it--the first time I read this book I teared up, but the emotion didn't remain in further readings. The mother's picking up a grown man is improbable and unnecessary to the story and the pictures are crude. The author had a good idea, but somehow it didn't work for me."
1,"Avoid all cd's, made by Emporio","I remember buying the original ""best of Tight Fit"" back in 1984, released on vinyl by Jive records, and loving every bit of it. Bought this CD, thinking it would be the same. Instead, this CD is just another cheap'o budget lable, that have simply got some of the group back together, and re-recorded the tracks, sometime in the early 1990's. Simply horrifying.My advice to record companies is, if you can't find the original recordings, please, please, please, (i'm absolutely begging), don't insult the artist or the group, with releasing a al-cheap-o version of their work."
2,** WOW~~~~~~,"i never thought i will gonna love this book this much.!!Good for yourself, good for your teen-kid, good for your adult-kid,good for sunday bible study,i just bought 8 of them from different seller. lolGod will bless all of you with this book.!!"
1,Silly story,"I saw this when it first came out. Maybe because of all the explosion and shooting, I didn't realize how stupid the story was. No wonder it totally bombed at the box office, even with Clooney and Kidman. This ain't 007 or Die Hard, so don't try to be one. I just hope that the real peacemakers are smarter than this. If you are not ready to simply turn off your brain for two hours, skip it. But if you still want to judge it for yourself, then stop reading.1. The fighting scene on the bridge is ridiculous. Is this how US army works, I mean sending one person down to kill all the enemy, then the rest of the team joins him?2. If you know a nuclear bomb is coming into NY, you don't sit in the office and wait for someone to tell you the flight has already landed.3. You have an FBI team to capture someone, do you send everyone to his room, leaving nobody to watch the exits?This just goes on and on."
2,Nowhere to go but up,"Pam Muñoz Ryan's, Becoming Naomi León, is a contempory realistic fiction that tells of a young girl's attempts to find out who she is. Set in a small town Naomi struggles with abandonment, manipulation, and a journey that takes her to another country in order for her to connect with a part of her family she doesn't even know.This is not a book for younger children and even with 9 -11 year olds; there are topics that parents should be willing to address. Some areas include child abandonment, children with special needs, and cultural bias to name a few. It is well written and was enjoyable to read."
2,GREAT FUN,"This game is great, everything about it is refined to perfection, making it the best game about picking up guns and shooting people. I can't believe some people are saying that the ps2 controls are better that these controls. You aim with the mouse, not the arrow keys, Sheesh. Some may say the gameplay is not varied enough, but for some reason, it keeps pushing you to get to the end. The only problem I have with the game is the AI, the baddies are sometimes horribly stupid. They will shoot each other, throw grenades into walls, and shoot at walls. Maybe it is to make the game more like a action movie, but I wanted to see the mercenaries you fight later in the game have some real attack strategies.My advice to you: go get the pc version rather than the ps2 version, it has better graphics, more responsive controls, you can save anywhere you want, and you can take advantage of the vibrant mod community."
1,"Actually, I haven't seen this...","I tried to, but according to the manager of my local Disney Store, there is some problem with this title and Dinosaur that cause them to fail on some older DVD players. They had no news about planned fixes for these titles. They also couldn't say whether this problem would be recurring in future releases.Just thought you should know..."
2,Christian Doctrine,This is a very clearly written book that provides many practical examples as teaching aids. It is basically an old book (though in 1994) but very good to use to prepare for ordination exams.
2,Lost - Season One,"Relentlessly addictive. Make sure you have plenty of free time because when this arrives, you'll be watching six episodes a night into the wee small hours of the morning."
1,"True to Form, Mr. Hitchens","Christoper Hitchens will do absolutely anything for a buck. He betrayed friendships, mucked and fudged everything he could.. misappropriated, distorted, misinterpreted, cunningly edited, told half truths, and made a fool of himself on the talk show circuit making & promoting this book. But Bill Clinton is only the latest victim to produce visions of golden sugar plums in Mr. Hitchens' mind.. his last expose of Mother Theresa as dictatorial con artist should give the reader a hint of the odd, money besotted, delusional character of Hitchens' work."
1,A book for the non-buddhist believer,"Firstly, this book is not by the Dalai Lama. It is written by Michael Cutler who includes his interviews with the Dalai Lama.I found this book frustrating. Dr. Cutler interviews the Dalai Lama and then tries to support the Dalai Lama's message with his own personal experiences and scientific research. As a buddhist, I know why and how the Dalai Lama is ""happy"" and I don't need a psychiatrist to prove it. My message to Dr. Cutler, relax and believe!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITS HORRIBLE,"I HAVE A 3 MONTH OLD SON AND I OWN THE DIAPER CHAMP. THE ODOR CONTROL IS NON EXSISTANT----MY SONS ROOM STINKS. NOT ONLY THAT BUT WHEN I CHANGE THE PAIL I HAVE LITTLE BUGS IN THE BAG AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAIL, AND I CHANGE THE BAG 3 OR 4 TIMES A WEEK. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,Excelent Gaming and also Photo card,"When you buy a digital camera you also must buy a card for store the pictures that you will take. You must think in 3 things:1. Amount of space in the card vrs size of the pictures according to how many Megapixel you camera can deliver.2. Price3. Speed of the card, because if you select a slow card you must wait for the picture to be save in the card before you take your next picture...For the price, size and speed this product is awesome a good buy."
2,A++ transaction,"Great seller, quick shipping, terrific price. Was a gift for my sister and she was very pleased with it, as am I with the whole transaction. Thank you."
2,Great Binoculars!,"These binoculars are really good for the price. I've read Steiner is the best and that's what I wanted. Very pleased with color and clarity and simple operation, nice little carry case too!"
2,I am more than satisfied,I was extremely please with my purchase. I will definitely check back the next time I am in need of textbooks!
1,For very fat people only,Unable to return due to lousy return policy. But relaxed means huge which seems to be a trend with Americans
1,You definitely get what you pay for.,"I saw raving reviews about this product - AND it was cheap! I previously had a COBY Transmitter that I was trying to replace. It had a short in it and the sound had deteriorated significantly. However, the sound of the COBY was still better than the sound in the iTrip. Now, if this is your first FM Transmitter and you have nothing else to compare it to, then you may think that it is wonderful! But trust me, with this product, you get what you pay for. I paid about $10 for my COBY FM Transmitter and I plan to purchase another one. I would return the iTrip - but for $2? Not so much!"
2,Great watch for a reasonable price,"I was surprised when going over my previous Amazon orders, I ordered this Invicta Pro Diver watch in February 2009, almost 4 years ago. I have used it almost daily since I bought it and it has worked perfectly. The watch still looks good, though, as other reviewers noted, the shiny middle links in the bracelet and the clasp do show minor scratches (that aren't really noticeable from a few feet away.)For a traditional movement watch, it keeps perfect time, rarely gaining or losing more than 15 seconds a month. I haven't been able to tell if it runs fast or slow, as it usually is only a few seconds from the Atomic Time reading from my computer. The handy rotating bezel is still tight and setting the date on months of fewer than 31 days works perfectly.Over the holidays I looked at other Invicta diver watches and may buy one in another color as an alternative to this one. I am very pleased with the watch and would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend."
2,Great movie,"My husband, a lifelong Red Sox fan, really likes this video. He gets to relive those glorious 4 days (and not have to stay up until 1:00 am to do it!)"
1,WHERE IS MY MOVIE DISK!@?,Great Movie but I recieved TWO Special Features Disk and a DVD Movie Disk. Where's my blu-ray Movie Disk!? I still can't believe this $*#^. Read aleast one other that has two special feature disk instead of the movie. My limited edition # 28155/3500. Anyone else get screwed?
2,"An eye opener, both for me and partner.","A very useful book, but it also emphasizes/idealizes the fact that these are one sided relationships, and that you are involved with a person who has an enormous difficulty becoming close with or identifying with others. It provided me with the clarity to see that at least the relationship I was in was not working, and that my partner would never realize my sacrifices in the name of ""our"" life, nor be in a position to reciprocate until she could trust me. The diservice this book does to the partner is it seems to downplay the frustration and rage that partners clearly expressed. This is an *extremely* difficult relationship to both be in and walk away from, and the author does not seem to address the anguish of the partner, only how the partner can stuff his/her feelings in the interest of helping the recovering partner get along. One fulfilled partner does not a relationship make, and a 5 year payoff is not guaranteed."
1,dangerus?????????,"i wus trying to stapil my papr and then booM??it wont work after 5 time staple and when i try to make it work my fingr start bleeding,,,,,,,waste of money cant believ this."
2,Club House Games,The disk contains some great games. A good way to while aweay the time on an airplane or bus.
1,Cable did not work,Cable did not work - pure and simple. Confirmed this by replacing this cable with another one that worked just fine. Do not buy this!
2,wonderful cards,"I love these cards. Beautiful pictures, nice sized card to make it easy to carry with you as a constant reminder of your daily affirmation."
2,A must read!,"As a parent of a child with Down syndrome, this book is awesome! It really has been helping to make me realize I need to take more time for myself and the rest of my family. I highly recommend this book for any parent of a child with special needs!"
1,What an idiot,"I think it says something that I hadn't even heard of Carl Hiaasen until I read this book. After reading it, I have vowed never to buy any of his books again. Ok, considering that some none too bright folks (thats why they like this book, and it makes sense, Hiaasen is at their level) have made such accusations in the past, let me assure you that I have never worked for Disney. But what exactly has Disney done that offends this cry baby so much. I been to Flroida only 3 times. Believe me, I saw enough sleaze there to last a life time. Don't worry Carl, sleaze ain't going nowhere."
1,RoadMate 300,"Works good . . . when it works. This unit will work fine for weeks at a time, then inexplicably loose the signal. It can be literally days before it works again. I have contacted ""customer service"" at Thales, which is a waste of time. On the 2 occasions I contacted them about this problem, I got the same set of trouble-shooting steps, only what the second person told me was in complete reverse order of what the first person told me.The accuracy of the maps can be abysmal. I input an address in downtown Atlanta recently; the directions tried to put me off at an interstate exit that has not existed for over 12 years."
1,Brother OEM Problems,"I installed a new Brother OEM drum (DR-520) in my MFC-8870DW about 15 months ago, along with a new toner cartridge (TN-550)--again, Brother OEM. The drum is rated to last for 25000 copies. We are a low-volume office, so my total print volume in 15 months has been about 1500 pages. Still, the drum recently failed, resulting in horrible print quality. After a long conversation with Brother customer service, they told me that I should replace the drum. However, they would not agree to give me any type of adjustment or compensation. They told me the warranty on consumables is 90 days, period. But who is going to print 25000 pages in 90 days? So, they rate the drum for 25000 pages, but stop any type of warranty or adjustment period after only 90 days, regardless of how many pages have been printed or how premature the failure is. I would expect better. I guess Brother can consider me a dissatisfied customer..."
2,KICKING... with none of the other reviewers problems.,"Very easy set-up, I was up and running in about 15 minutes. It's been up and running for three days now - with no overheating, or drop-outs! I was streaming videos from about 75 feet away with no lag. Not working this weekend so, I'll see how far I can go and will up date.I was slightly disappointed with the USB port. Connected my printer and thought it would act as a networked printer. No, you have to virtually disconnect the printer from one machine to use it on another.I would highly recommend this product to a friend!UPDATE: Any where in my home I retained 99% signal strength. Very big back yard and I was getting 65% from 100yds away. Running a week+ now - no reset! Had to reset the Laptop a few times but, not the router. Very interested to see how this works with Ooma!The router is connected on my desktop which is running Vista. Notebook running 7. Gonna switch the DT over to 7. Will let you know if I have issues."
1,Yeah...,"This will be at least the 4th time I have bought this album, and I'm buying it because of the live disc. I've bought a lot of Hendrix. I've bought a lot of Led Zep. And I've got a lot of Grateful Dead. But I've never had to resort to buying an album 4 times to get live material before."
1,Worst movie ever. Ratings were lying.,Watching this movie made me loose faith in humanity. Not even close to soft core porn. The music was cheesy.
1,You'll never look at white panties with ruffles the same way,"This was a really strange movie and very long. If you don't like courtroom scenes, steer clear of this film, because it is basically one long courtroom scene. I have to admit it really was handled quite brilliantly, and I give credit to the scriptwriter and the actors who were the lawyers for the fact that it didn't quite put me to sleep. I was amazed that in 1959, the situation about assault, rape, and ripped white panties with ruffles was so freely talked about. I guess the code must have been on its way out even then.James Stewart was really the best thing about the movie but even he couldn't make it a wonder. The guy who played Pa Kwimper in ""Follow That Dream"" was the sidekick and helped a bit with the case.I can't say I highly recommend this movie unless you're a diehard fan of James Stewart or courtrooms."
1,Not Worth the Purchase,I burn DVDs and needed cases for them. These have been almost 20% useless - you can't slide any papers under the clips on the inside of the case because then the little plastic pieces that hold them closed break and the case won't latch. About 1 in every 5 does that anyway. Get something a little sturdier!
2,The product,the item was easy to install and use. A great size if you are drawing and one of the best buys I made recently.
1,Entertaining but Too Whiny,"I wasn't a fan of the Nanny t.v. show but when I saw the book I started reading it at the bookstore and ended up buying it. I sympathize with her ""year from hell"" (i.e., cancer, show cancellation, divorce, death of pet, etc.) but she doesn't seem to get how privileged she was having the means to excellent and exclusive healthcare. She also had the luxury to recuperate at leisure, be pampered by friends and family which most working women don't. Also, as savvy as Ms. Drescher is, I wondered why she didn't seek alternative medical advice too?It's funny in spots but the ""poor me"" drivel gets to you by the end of the book. Maybe if I'd known she had donated the proceeds of the book to a woman's cancer charity or something, I wouldn't be so hard on her. Instead, the cynic in me can see her on the talk shows promoting the book and herself with gusto."
2,Good Stuff,"It is your typical 2gb Micro SD card, but you can't beat the price. Bought it for my cell phone to store music and ring tones on. The only problem is if you have big hands careful it is small and if you drop it on the floor you will be hunting for like a Where's Waldo book."
2,Joan has moved on to better things,"this cd is great. however, i was recently in new york at the jeff buckley birthday tribute and joan wassers new band BLACK BEETLE played- AMAZING. all record companies should adhere to their solicitation and all music lovers should be on the look out. Black Beetle is coming to take over the world"
1,It's all hype,"Looking over her body of work confirms to me that I have never actually enjoyed any of Angelina Jolie's movies and some of her movies aren't even real movies but visual showcases. She's watchable and talented but she doesn't seem to get good movie roles. Maybe she looks too lush but many of her roles involve her looking like the archetypal beautiful vampiress. When she dyes her hair white or changes her accent, I tend to lose attention. I like the actress but there's been nothing I like with her in it. Gia showcased her ability to intimidate but perhaps like Elizabeth Taylor, this actress's career and fame exists despite the paucity of her roles even in old favorites with Montgomery Clift. Remember Butterfield 8?"
2,It does exactly what it is supposed to do.,"The reason I chose this power supply adapter is that if you experiment with other simmilar power adapters you may end up either damaging your gadget(s) or having undesired results. In my case, I had tried simmilar power adapters with my rp-50 unit, but many of these would get some kind of annoying noise through the circuits. So far I have had no problems whatsoever, the sound coming out of my unit is clean because this is the recommended power supply; recommended amperage and volts."
1,Imperialist Impertinence,"This book is an affront to post-colonial Indology, being a prime example of imperialist-colonial impertinence. A significant omission in the snide review of literature on Shivaji is that of the Dalit savant Babasaheb Ambedkar, most probably because the latter's civil and learned opinion would not suit the author's insidious designs to drive a wedge in the native population on the basis of caste. Ever wondered why this visionary man did not lead the Dalits to convert to either Christianity or Islam? Better if the James William Laine had first paid sufficient attention to papering over the cracks in his shoddy account, than pointing fingers at those who are not in a position to defend themselves against his 'below-the-belt' polemics."
1,The 16MB Memory Card,"Yes, it dose hold 16MB of memory and is about the same price as an 8MB memeory card. But there is a very big down side to this product. Most of the games do not regester the memory card so you can't save them. Another down side is that you must download the Memory Card software to your system each time you restart or turn off your system."
1,A 10? Please Read My Reveiw!,"How can people rate this book a 10? It's about a group of rabbits that go on a journey to prevent themselves from an unknown tragedy in a warren that a small rabbit named Fiver had a premonition of. I mean it's a book about talking rabbits. I did enjoy the parts when they came across things during the journey, but I did not like the idea of rabbits as main characters. I am 14 and I don't think I'd waste my time reading this book again in ten years ."
1,Piece of CRAP!!!,This is a piece of junk.... worst design ever made... Doesn't belong in the fridge.. belongs in the trash!!!! Would not recommend... The two piece on top is what makes it a piece of CRAP!!!
2,Olympus Stylus 740--A Great Little Camera,"I bought this camera for my wife. She wanted one that was small enough to fit into her purse without taking up space. It was my aim to buy a quality camera that would not be outdated by the time Christmas was over with. This camera turned out to be a real gem. My expectations were surpassed. It takes great pictures that are equivalent and somewhat better than the digital SLR I bought two years ago. The buttons and features are easy to use and the display is very clear. The water resistance was tested on Christams day (It was very rainy that day) and passed with flying colors. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and will look to Olympus for future camera needs."
2,Feels Great!,"Offers great support right where you need it! I haven't used the strap, but it looks like it would slip pretty easily. Conforms to any chair, and really has helped to relieve my lower back pain from sitting and studying for hours on end. I'm glad I bought this."
1,Lack of depth and irrelevant subjects - a waste of money,"I was very disappointed with this book. I expected to read about being a young boy whose imagination was captured by the beginnings of the American manned-space program; how the courageous efforts of those involved in the Mercury program brought about a wave of pride in America; and that it was the dream of many boys and girls to travel into space and maybe go to the Moon!What I got was a book that talked a lot about the Space Shuttle program and child birth?!Having grown up with the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs (and being old enough to remember them!) I was eager to share in the memories of a kindred spirit, but found the author's recollections lacking. It seemed the author struggled to have enough subject matter to give the book sufficient length."
2,Awesome book by an awesome Author,"This is the 2nd book I have read by Barbara Hambley and I am going right back to get the next book in this series.The author has a way of putting you into the setting and bringing the plot to life.At times it is painful to learn of the struggles of our African American ancestors but the author goes even deeper to explain the different social levels of all the people of that era.This book has a little of everything History, mystery,action adventure and drama. I highly recommend it."
2,Even better on Vinyl,"I just scored Jean-Luc Ponty's Enigmatic Ocean LP in mint condition, on vinyl, through Ebay for $6.00. Totally made my day. What a great album."
1,wrong edition sent,Ordered a new edition and received a veryold 3rd edition. Cannot use for my class. Waste of my money unfortunately.
1,less than average,These guys sound like they recorded this cd in a trash can. I don't need my metal polished but it has to sound good. Eighteen dollars gone.
2,Super Bluray and the best Halloween scene maybe ever filmed,I'm from St. Louis so I have a soft spot in my heart already for this story. It is a terrific family story with characters with very distinct personalities. One of the best features of this movie is the fall/winter atmosphere. One of my favorite scenes has got to be a Halloween scene with all the neighborhood kids in the middle of a street. It is hilarious. They are burning furniture in the middle of the road and talking about basically assaulting people (I assume they were joking). It's surreal... because today these kids would basically be considered a criminal street gang! It's funny stuff like this and heart that makes this an amazing movie. And the Bluray picture is amazing! Colors pop and the image quality is very clear. The packaging for this Bluray is a digibook format and is very sturdy. It includes several pages of color photos and facts about the movie. Highly recommend!
1,lousy quality,"Was very disappointed in this dvd. Description says COLOR - but it is not. The quality is very grainy,"
1,Bad choice,"This book and mostly all of the Osborne series contains a lot of text whith no meaning at all. If you have a good understanding of the four core modules (especially the 3rd core), the added value of this book is almost nothing at all. Secondly the layout of the book makes this book very hard to read, although it's English... Compared to the four core books of Microsoft Press self, no other rating than one star is well deserved."
2,thought-provoking,"The Giver is written in a unique style that gives much for the imagination to ponder. Lowry's descriptions are vague as well as the ending. However, I feel Lowry wants each reader to come away from the book with something personal so she leaves certain details open to interpretation.The plot is unique taking place in a perhaps futuristic world. The community in which the main character, Jonas, lives seems to be controlled by computers and other sophisticated technology. The people live simplistic lives, but Jonas will learn the secrets behind the community. He faces decisions that ultimately prove to be too much and he must leave the community. The ending is rivoting and readers will be moved and surprised by the ending."
1,joke gift,Obviously these are in effective. But makes a great joke gift. So now they are asking me to write at least 20 words. I would not have bought these for any other reason- it was a joke. Who knows maybe they work. I'll never know.
1,Really?,"Although this could be entertaining to someone who knows nothing about history, this series is not historically accurate. It's accurate in the sense that it takes place in Italy and that Caesar was assassinated, but beyond that it's pretty laughable. They might as well have made a series about George Washington being kidnapped by the stage characters from Chucky Cheese and then being saved by Peter Pan and the defensive line for the Chicago Bears. It really is that stupid. LOL"
1,"A Good Idea, but...","This pet waste disposal system has tremendous need for improvement. The ""triple seal"" doesn't keep foul smelling odors out as well as I'd expected and the ""scented"" liners work better when accompanied by enormous amounts of Lysol. I start a new bag every other day in an attempt to keep the stench down. This disposal system while a good idea, needs improvement."
2,"Catherine, called Birdy, by Karen Cushman","This book ""Catherine called Birdy"" was great book. It had lots of characters, and it was funny how she had to put up with those men. You see, Chatherine is a girl who lives with her mother and father, and she's supposed to get married to a man. So the father tries to set her up with some men, but to Catherine thinks they are hideous. As you keep reading throughout the book,to me, the book gets a little bit funnier every chapter. I really liked this book alot, even though I'm a thiller book fan this book go my attention. Overall I would have to give this book four star, some part were a little boring in some chapters. The book was very entertaining, funny and sometimes boring"
2,A SEDUCTIVE ORIENTAL FRAGRANCE,"This is one of the early women's fragrances launched by Boucheron. It is more dramatic than Initial, highlighted by a floral Oriental tone.Jaipur or ""jewel"" was inspired by a trip made by the company's current president's grandfather to Jaipur, a city whose reputation for precious stones was legendary. Thus, the fragrance was introduced in a jewel flacon. The original bottles are, of course, highly prized by collectors today.Long recognized as makers of elegrant, luxurious jewelry Boucheron began in 1830 when the first store opened in Paris. It was not until 1988 that the first Boucheron fragrance was launched."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought it even though other people said that it would not work on their PC. After many attempt with installing, uninstalling, turning off the firewall, etc, it does not work on my PC. What a bummer!"
2,All the Pretty Horses,"I am enjoying this selection, it is a bit odd not to have quotes around the spoken word I would and will read more from this author."
2,Who's the cat and who's the mouse?,"Great premise - a cat-and-mouse game between an undercover cop positioned deep within a Triad gang and a high-ranking police lieutenant, who is actually a Triad mole. While it nevers attains the intensity or heat that I would have expected, it's still sharp and intriguing, and I definitely look forward to the Scorsese version."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Risk Your Health on this Book!,"A patient of mine presented this book for my opinion. After a brief review of Peskin's book I was aghast at his suggestions. Food items in his recommended diet included bacon, ham and deli meats; all laden with nitrates, a known carcinogen.An additional reference advocated plant sources of omega-3 fatty acids, citing that all fish oils are tainted. This is a falacious statement as even the best plant sources of omega-3 are at least 50% omega-6 which is already abundant in most diets.Good quality fish oils are available that are virtually devoid of all contaminants and are independently tested for purity.How can any book that purports to treat cancer make such recommendations and misstatements?Dr. Glenn B.

2,Working honeymoon in Ireland,"""Laced"" is a fun few hours of light reading in the Regan Reilly series. Regan and Jack are on their honeymoon in Ireland but you know that crimes and mysteries surround them wherever they go! So when a handmade lace tablecloth is stolen from the castle/hotel where they are staying, you know they have to catch the culprits. Follow them as they investigate the crime all over the Galway area on the west coast of Ireland, and sit back for a fun adventure that also includes ""ghosts"", scam artists, and dental mishaps."
2,"Funny, touching, captivating!","I recently purchased this DVD set on a whim and was absolutely captivated by it. It was funny, romantic, touching, sad, suspenseful. All the actors were magnificent, especially the 3 leads. I tried to drag it out 3 nights but found I just couldn't. I finally gave in - it was like devouring a guilty pleasure in one sitting. Surfed the web and found Reckless, the Sequel, and ordered it sent 2-day priority mail. Get them both at the same time - the sequel is just as wonderful. This series reminded me what a joy good entertainment can be."
2,leave in scalp treatment,"Fast shipping, tried product and has a soothing feel to the scalp. Thanks, D.Storm"
2,motivation,"It's a good workout video to help keep you motivated in your workout even when it's cold outside. It really doesn't feel as if you are working out as you're doing it. Easy to do, and keep up with."
1,Broke after a year,"My son bought this fan and after seeing how well it worked, my mother and I decided to buy one for each of us. So, there were three fans. After one year of use, the first broken was mine. The fan didn't work. The second fan broken was my mothers' the fan didn't work either. And the last one with six months of difference was my son's. My son didn't use it as much as we did so probably that's the reason it lasted more. I did my research and found that the fan has a defect in two resistors that overheat and burn out. Definitively WON'T buy from Lasko again."
2,A Million Little Pieces,"Hooked from the beginning, page one, I could not put this book down. I identified with every thought, word, and feeling. I was amazed by the courage of the writer, and his strength in sticking to his gut feelings in a recovery world that tells one that one's own best thinking landed them in the place that they occupy! That he did this with courage, dignity, fear,guilt, great love and sick will gave me a feeling of great hope for him, and all human beings at a particularly negative time in human history! The depth and breadth of his honesty was a homecoming for me and many like me."
2,Coolest Stuff,Neglect is one of my favorite bands. (Almost) Every single song is about dying. It's good if that's how you feel about yourself. The singer really did die too. He killed himself.
2,Epic!!,"This will definitely give you a good laugh a couple of times, however the story line might be lacking a little bit but it's definitely funny."
2,Incredible GAME,"This games is great in all aspects, from INCREDIBLE graphic, sound, fun, a little short but it does not matter with all the rest of the fun you can get."
2,Brockden Brown's Twisted Imagination,"This novel is an excellent journey through the dark, disturbing wilderness of 18th century America and its dangers. The wars that raged between Natives and their oppressors (the English) are here brutally portrayed. With a new introduction to English literature of the effects of sleepwalking, this is also a journey through the psychology of a psychotic sleepwalker, and the devils that haunt him. An excellent read for those searching for the natural horror of humanity, with a little suggestion of the supernatural, though very heavy both in language, and symbolism and metaphor. A tough read, but well worth it."
1,I was very disappointed. No illustrations.,"I was under the impression that this would include the original illustrations. . but unless there's a magic way to see them, there are none. There are 16 pages of blanks but not one illustration.I fell ripped off."
1,"Fifty Cent's ""Get Rich or Die Tryin""","This album is crap. There was only one good song on the whole album. Don't waste your money on this album like I did. Just buy the single of ""P.I.M.P."""
2,the best rock movie yet,"rock has to go to the rain forest to bring a guy home for a criminal who he is forced to work for.there is the rock,some goofy idiot hes chasing whose also in bulletproof monk.the bad guy plays a mob type in every movie ive ever seen him in.but well.the kids will like it too.it is a action movie.there are some minor flaws with this like the rock delivering a rock bottom during a fight.CHEESEY!!!!!!!!!!the part where the monkey humps rocks face is just nasty.i dont see why the directors have a great movie like this one then go throw a monkey trying to force himself on an x-wrestler into it.its just stupid.theres this one mexican chick in it but shes to cranky to be hot.there is an outstanding fight scene pitting the rock against some midget rain fotest people.this movie is better than the hype!"

1,Very wordy,There are better books than this on operating systems. This book is very wordy...great for those nights when you cannot fall asleep.
2,Very Good Service,"Thank you once again for very good service. My videos arrived in two days, which was very surprising considering I did not order any fast, special delivery service, as they came just the regular way."
1,Not for Kids!,"My kids were really looking forward to seeing Atlantis, but boy were we disappointed! First, the plot was hard for me to follow, nevermind the young children who are the intended audience. Also, a chain-smoking character is not appropriate for a children's movie. I'm glad Disney is trying to do something different, but I think they've lost sight of who the movie's intended auidence is."
1,LCD problems,"LCD date display only shows partial numbers, so I can't program the date. LCD time display only shows partial numbers, so I can't program the time. After taking my blood pressure, the systolic LCD display does not show up at all. Diastolic and pulse LCD displays only show partial numbers, so I can't read it. Can't vouch for the accuracy of the product because I CAN'T READ THE OUTPUT! Mabis requires me to send them $5 if I send them the product for replacement/repair. Other reviewers with similar complaints indicate lack of response from the company. jeez."
2,The World of Chas and Dave,"These two wonderful British musicians have turned the world of East Florida into a madhouse of Chas and Dave followers. From Jacksonville to Miami they are well known, and, the most beautiful song to come along in many years [""Flying""] is the undisputed hit of the Florida Treasure Coast. Buy this CD--- you will love it-- I personally guarantee it!!"
2,saved me time and money,"Better than what's used by the national chain.The parts store offers free check engine light tests.Their reader only said ""O2 sensor"". Parts guy said other things can trigger an O2 fault,so you should clean this, check that, etc. Wasted 2 weeks chasing nothing.This reader said which O2 sensor was bad and why. Replaced the sensor...problem gone.Oh, almost forgot. Beat local prices by more than 50 percent!"

1,Size does matter?,"Love, love, LOVE Katie Macalister's books but NOT this one! Just couldn't like the heroine...and couldn't understand the attraction between her the the hero, Max. She's a size 18, five years older than him, throws up on this shoes at their first meeting, breaks wind in front of him at the next, babbles unintelligently, meddles in his relationship with his daughter, and yet....he falls madly in love with her. I really like the fact that Ms. Macalister writes about women who are less than perfect, but this one was just too irritating for words! Couldn't finish the book. Hope the next book is back up to Ms. Macalister's usual standards."
2,WOW,"sony's latest version of the v-series... simply an amazing tv, owner will be blown away by it's sleek design, ease of use, and superior viewing quality. Consisting of a 64x 10-bit processor and their Live Color Creation, you can only imagine how stunning the picture will be. Even includes future expansion capabilities. Sony has definitely lived up to it's name with this product. A+"
2,GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Lillix is an absalutely GREAT band! I mean it. I listned to it at my friend's house- and I fell in love with it. If you buy it, then I promise you will like at least 4songs on the CD!!!!"
2,"worth reading, though a little light","First of all, let me start by telling you I am almost as obsessed with Gregory's books as I am with Tudor history - and that's saying something. This is a wonderful book, told in 3 ladies point of view. I was really excited to read this, because I didn't know much about 2 of the 3 ladies. All of that being said, however... as much as I did enjoy this book (and I give it 4 out of 5 stars), I was so disappointed because the story line seems so... simple. I would have thought this was a young adult book, except... it's not a young adult book. I kept waiting for more. I did thoroughly enjoy the portrayal of Anne of Cleves & slightly less so of Lady Jane Rochford, but Katherine Howard... childlike, immature, beautiful, vain Katherine Howard, just drove me nuts. I have never believed her to be as simple as Gregory pictured her.All in all, I'd recommend to other history buffs, but it's not a book I'd read again."
2,Florsheim Rivas,"These are the best shoes on the planet. They look incredibly sharp in black, they are extremely low-maintenance, and they are unbelievably comfortable. If you are in a position that requires you maintain a certain image and going barefoot is not an option, there are the shoes to buy."
2,Great movie,"Great movie about the way Vietnam changed the lives of those involved in it. De Niro is great as the strong,deep, leader of his group of friends."
1,Awful,This book is in my top 10 list of the worst books I've ever read! It started off ok but something went terribly wrong. Never again will I buy Mr. Whyte's books.
2,All Writers Should Purchase,"I simply believe all Christian writers should purchase a copy of this book each year if they are truly interested in publishing in the Christian market. To my knowledge, there is no better book for the purpose of learning about and knowing the current market than this one.Stuart does a remarkable job of keeping up with this ever-growing and changing field!A MUST BUY!!!!"
1,An out right rip off,"This item did not work from the day I purchased it. The item was set for another computer and no cd was sent with the product to help link it to my computer. The seller was also working for Amazon. Be aware of anything you buy that is electronic and used from Amazon. I had to give a one star rating, I wanted to give it a zero star rating"
1,broke after a few weeks...,"My camera fitted and the case looks OK, but after just a few uses the strap that allows attaching the case to a belt broke at the upper seams, without me noticing. I was lucky that my new camera survived the fall AND that somebody pointed out to me that I'd lost something..."
2,Transformers Fan,"Love it and always will, and miss it...For furthor detailed Preview feel free to refer to the last tree posted before this one...SincerelyViola V. Sg."
1,Poor quality recording.,The material is good but the execution leaves much to be desired. Volume varies significantly between tracks. This CD sounds like a tape recorded off the radio.
2,Only In Your Arms,"Definitely a great book. It kept my interest from page one. I have to rank it in her top four best novels she wrote, which is high praise since she's one of the best authors I have read so far (and I have read ALOT of books)."
1,Somebody doesn't like cats...,"I rented this movie hoping for a fantasy look at the war between cats and dogs, but no, I didn't get that.What I did get was a movie making cats look pathetic, unintelligent, and evil, whilst the dogs wound up looking brave, noble, and smart. This contains essentially nothing but a bunch of dogs out smarting and beating up felines.Whoever thought of this must have had something against cats.It did make me chuckle once or twice, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1.I don't recommend this to anyone."
2,Food for the imagination,"This book is a way to glimpse a little of the unusual and unexpected. In just over 200 pages it presents over 70 very short stories by different authors. The styles and subjects very greatly, yet each fits into no more than a couple of pages and each has the potential to spark a new thought, or send you off in a new direction.As Goethe said `One ought, every day at least, to hear a little song, read a good poem, see a fine picture, and if it were possible, to speak a few reasonable words.'This books offers over seventy leaps of the imagination. Who could reasonably ask for more."
2,A Sarah McLachlan Must Have!,As an avid Sarah McLachlan fan I am always searching for new albums and such. When I first bought the Mirrorball CD I listened to it over and over again. Most of my favorite songs were there. Then I heard that a Video collection of the same album was to be released with more music on it. I bought it as soon as it was available and never regret the purchase. It is definately worth owning.
2,Terrific plans for terrific days in Tokyo,"If you visit, live or even are just curious about Tokyo, Little Adventures is a truly wonderful guide. I bought it on a whim, but it was invaluable when deciding what to do on my first visit to Japan. It's fascinating reading even if you never visit! With such a wide variety of trips, there will surely be many things that will interest you.I admit I have a special happiness for this book. One of the happiest days of my entire life was a visit to Minka-en, because of this book's description. That day is one of the most peaceful, happy, and memorable memories of my entire life. It was worth 100 times the price of this terrific guide. Thank you, Rick Kennedy!"
1,An Unhelpful Review,"Shoppers appear to find only four- and five-star ratings ""helpful,"" and this movie has been reviewed so many times that probably nobody will read my review, but here goes:Overhyped garbage. Gets two stars for interesting concept, slyly promoted, but if judged purely from the enjoyment derived from watching it, the rating goes into negative numbers. My wife and I saw it in original theatrical release and it gave us both sick headaches.An ""Emperor's New Clothes"" element is at work here in how people who bought into the hype will not admit what trash this is."
1,Waste of Money,"I have another DVD from Tracey that also offered three options. The upper body option was decent for days you want something quick and efficient. The lower body option was boring and not effective. I decided to give this a chance thinking it would be similar to her previous workout but more of a challenge. It wasn't, in fact, it was less challenging and very annoying. If you are brand new to exercise this might be for you. Just do it on mute, because they repeat the same phrases throughout the entire workout for all three tracks and the same excerices for four rounds."
1,"Depressingly, dismally uninspiring","Inspiration is catching, and apparently also the converse. Finding the words to adequately describe the depths of just how dismal and uninspiring is too great a task this moment. The photography is flat, the depicted works clumsy and crude, and the text shallow. From cover to cover, this book is a celebration of mediocrity. If I believed the level of skill depicted is the best I could attain in my lifetime, I would give up right this moment."
1,Uncomfortable,The shoulder straps are way too big and wide.There is no support in the cups.Fit is not great and feels uncomfortable.
1,This Ain't Gospel...,"If you like New Orleans Jazz, Gospel and soul and you buy CDs at Amazon.com, you may find this album as a recommendation. Don't get me wrong, I generally love Amazon's suggestions, but this is hip-hop house music with only the slightest hint of the influences of Gospel. Long, repetitious chants of ""What the f**k"" can make for a great song but just not what I was expecting. Yeah, Fat Boy Slim has evolved, but not very much."
1,bad idea to buy through amazon,"product came quickly enough but box was damaged. plastic hub over rear sprocket was shattered but rest of contents seemed ok. after removing bike and starting to assemble, had all kinds of trouble. The front brake line was not connected to the handlebar. called kent and they said they usually pay to have a local bike shop assemble and tune up the bike when purchased over the net. how come i did'nt get this service when i purchased through you. another problem is the tech dept of kent is only open until 3:30 eastern time. i have a problem with shifting into highest gear on the main sprocket and work during the day so i can't reach tech support when i get home. i need help with this problem and i'm not paying a bike shop to do it.all in all i would not recomend buying a bike this way and would tell anybody that if asked. i think going to bike shop or sporting goods store would be better. if you have a problem you can talk to them and have it fixed."
1,Built To Not Too Thrilled,"I love BTS and almost everything they've put out, but when I first listend to Ultimate AW I had to check that I had the right CD. This is nothing like the rest of their music and should defintely not be the first BTS you listen to becuase it will probably turn you off. I think they got a little too experimental with this and deviated from what was working (out of boredom maybe). Whatever the reason, Ultimate Alt is really lacking that awesome, unique BTS sound that is otherwise consitent in their other CDs. If you're looking for some great Built To Spill, check out Keep It Like A Secret, Perfect From Now On, or Nothing Wrong With Love."
1,Join the Pyramid Scheme,"Dr. Neil Solomon not only lost his license, but is also under an agreement to never practice medicine or give medical advice, so now he pushes quack cures like Noni Juice which is distributed via the internet and through multi-level marketing.Noni juice companies use this so-called ""guide"" in order to promote their useless products and Solomon is actually the official physician of the ""International Noni Communicatiion Council"" and is hardly an impartial scientist.Looking for sound medical advice in this waste of paper is like asking the meat marketing board for a vegetarian recipe."
1,Worse Reception than a Kid Dressed in Tin Foil,"This product simply does not work!I received better reception from my receiver without the use of an antenna.I tried to connect this using both the dual wire method and the provided cable jack. Nothing!I do live in a condo with mostly concrete walls, but when the product is placed by the window, the reception still does not improve.This product only gets 1 star because I can't give it 0."
1,This book is small,I was expecting a full size hard cover and got a mini me hard cover book. Paid a hard cover price. Should have went to Barnes and Noble. Will next time.
1,A waste of money,"This book hardly deserves even one star. It is a typical example of a great man's biography written by a dime novel scribbler. It presents poorly organized Radzinsky's hectic emotions based mostly on newspaper gossip and well known memoirs of prince Felix Yusupov etc.For instance: the circumstances of Rasputin's murder as depicted in this book have nothing in common with the real events which have been reconstructed quite recently by Andrew Cook in his well researched ""To Kill Rasputin: The Life and Death of Gregori Rasputin"". For a complete and more accurate biography of Rasputin you should find the book by Russian historian Oleg Platonov, though I am not sure his works have been translated in English.Of course you may come across even worse books about Rasputin, but it is hardly an excuse for these 500 pages of hackneyed rubbish."
1,"Great DVD playback, but unreliable performance.","I gave this Samsung 2 stars because of the terribly unreliable performance, and because of the slow repair and customer service with Samsung.The playback on DVD's, when it works, is exceptional. The record feature, when it works, is very good for record lengths under 2 hours, and grainy on longer recordings. Menu is easy and intuitive.If this player/recorder were reliable I would give it four stars and perhaps even buy a Samsung TV. However, the player freezes, stops playing mid-movie, often won't record, and usually will not load commercially produced DVDs. It's been at the repair center for about two weeks and I still don't have an estimated repair date. If I could do it over again I would buy the Panasonic, instead."
1,Junk & Double JUNK,"My daughter recieved this player as a Christmas gift in 2004. She used it maybe 4 time in 2 weeks then it quite playing, no preview screen, no sound, no nothing, and on top of that the DVD door latch broke when i was trying to figure out what was wrong.Wish I would have read some of the reviews on this product before we purchased it.I recently traded it in on a Magnavox MPD720 picture is better and has all the same accessories and functions as the Polaroid and then some, cost is a little more ($239.00) but you probably get what you pay for."
2,"A great ""What If...""","What would have happened had Lee Harvey Oswald lived to face the charge of assassinating President Kennedy? How many times has that been asked? Well, in Walt Brown's book, you'll get a look of what MIGHT have happened...of course Walt ASSUMES that Oswald would have gotten a ""fair trial""...of that, I'm not sure.It is a fascinating look at how so much of the alleged ""open and shut"" case could have been seriously undermined by the laws of evidence and competent cross-examination by someone whose job was to protect Oswald's rights...it also shows how fortunate the federal government...and the state of Texas...were that Oswald didn't live."
1,"Missing Disk Episode 5, two bonus disk 1","Well, I pre-ordered this long ago and waited, waited, waited. Arrived without a disk for Episode 5, with bonus disk 1 in it's slot. There were 2 bonus disk #1s and no episode 5.The changes made are very hokey. Dissappointed."
1,The Trial,"I was eagerly anticipating this game in the mail. It's a bit rare nowadays so I didn't mind the fact it took almost a week to get to me after I ordered it with 2 day shipping. When it finally came, I open the envelope but it turns out instead of Sonic Adventure 2 the full game like I was promised, I ended up with Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial. I basically paid nearly thirty dollars for a demo disc marked incorrectly."
2,You won't regret you got it.,"I also own the Baguette pan, and I wonder how I lived without these pans before. I bake bread twice a week and I was trying to accomplish the bakery-like crispy crust, while having the professional look, too. You will never have flattened breads, and you will love the evenly baked loaves. I get many compliments for my bread, and the crust ""sounds"" professionally now. The pan is very easy to clean overall with the exception of the holes, but if you use it as much as I do, it won't look new very long :)You will never regret you got it."
1,This is true crap rock!,"...only one song worth calling decentthat song is ""unnamed feeling""and it even is lacking in qualityin my opinion this was their sad try for mainstreamits horrible and pathetici thought when they picked up robert trujillo on bassthey'd go back to like the ""black album"" stylethis is just [bad]not worth the money..."
1,A cold and unremarkable remake...,"Although this may be a faithful remake something is seriously lacking in the execution. I would like to blame casting as each seemed to missed cast - especially Jason. The teenage crew is obnoxious and there isn't one that you don't wish to meet a horrible end. I think there was a movie here somewhere however between the casting, acting, writing, editing and cutting it just didn't make it out.The movie left me cold.See the original. Buy the original. This movie is a waste of time."
1,Not one of Giles Andreae's best,"I am a big fan of Giles' books. We have most of them! Our favorites.. Giraffes Can't Dance and Rumble in the Jungle. But this one did not meet our expectations. First of all, the mother sends Leo away! What mother would ever send her child away? It doesn't make sense. Also, I don't like all of the references to death. And ""biting through the skin"" of the zebra. It's definitely not good for young children."
1,A hair too big,"I have a grant gt steering wheel that's 14"" and this cover starts at 14.5"". I'll have to wait until I get another car to see how it feels."
2,KitchenAid Food Processor,"Great quality product. Makes so many cookings tasks a breeze. Two bowl sizes a big plus. It looks great on the counter, too. I'm so glad I bought this."
2,Disturbingly good,"The main topic of the book is one that shouldn't be taken lightly, however it is written in such a way that it is enjoyable to read and riveting at the same time. It makes you think about the topic at hand in a certain way that you probably shouldn't, and then leads you to question if you should have thought about it in that way to begin with.Its a topic that is very disturbing, but has been written so beautifuly, with great humor and sensitivity. Great read."
2,excellent,The book is very good for the age 7 up to 8.the book is very colorful. My kid loves reading it.
1,Glare renders glasses UNUSABLE but stylish.,"These glasses look and feel great for the price, but glare on the lenses leaves them almost useless in the sun. Visibility and contrast are so greatly reduced that I would not feel comfortable walking in these glasses let alone driving in them."
2,Mj's Gifts,"Bought two for daughter and son-in-law, they love them. Daughter gave me her's to enjoy while on trip. Now I love it, so easy. I'm 84, books are heavy, cumbersome and hard on eyes. Large print extra plus. I'm about to buy my third Kindle, this one is for me.Kindle: Amazon's 6"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)"
1,Very Disappointing,"I have a law office and receive e-mails with attachments of pleadings, memos and other documents. I purchased this product because I often could not open the attachments. Either I purchased the wrong product or it does not do what I expected. I still am unable to open most attachments (particularly ones that have been zipped by the sender)."
2,works well,"I needed something to help me remember to take my pills. I put one of these boxes out at night for the next morning and leave it out till after my evening pills, then put it away and replace for the next night. It works better for me than a timer going off. The boxes were bigger than I thought and I should have ordered the smaller boxes, even though I take fish oil and multi-vitamins, etc."
2,Wow!,Kids will love these. They are very glittery and fun and the price is great. They come in two shapes--stars and regular band-aid size. Great stocking stuffer.
2,"Good pictures, appropriate text","It's a calendar -- what can you say? All 365 days are there. It comes with its own little plastic stand, and we keep ours on a lazy Susan in the kitchen. The pictures are pretty good and usually the text is appropriate for a cat owner. In its favor -- it doesn't try hard to be cute or sophisticated or different -- no ""cats with bad attitudes"" etc. We tear off the previous day's picture each morning and look at the new picture. It's become a staple item under the Christmas tree, and my wife likes to turn a new page and find a picture that resembles one of our cats. We bought it for last year, we bought it for this year, and we'll buy it for next year."
2,a satisfied customer,My wife ordered this as a replacement for a product she had used for about a year. She says it is wonderful because it gives shape and body as well as softness to her hair without leaving a residue. A little goes a long way.
1,EAST BAY THUGG,"MAN I HATE THIS GARBAGE CD , DONT BUY THIS WEAK ONE HITTER QUITER ALBUM FROM THIS MAN! .... I DONT THINK HES PUTTIN ANYTHIN NEW OUT SOUNDS LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE EAST COAST $H!# , GO HEAD N CALL ME A HATER I AINT MAD!"
1,"Derivative, and lacks any internal logic","One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Starts off kinda sorta promising, and then turns into a sub-par survival horror movie that is derivative of every other such movie you've seen. It has no internal logic, and frequently breaks the rules it has established earlier. Nor does earn its ending. I can't say more without giving a lot away. Re-watch some Walking Dead 'sodes instead. (Or watch the 2006 horror movie of the same title, which is a genuinely good movie.)"
2,Growing talent delivers a stellar second novel.,I was fortunate enough to have taken The Rest of the Earth with me on a trip to Montana. Having the time to read the novel alone and uninterrupted was one of those literary pleasures that will be remembered forever. I entered the dreamscape of young Walker Avary and flowed with the beautifully written tale of a sensuous drifter. I marvelled at Mr. Henderson's ability to craft a story with a plot that moves mysteriously from the subtleties of deeply buried emotions interwined with the inevitability of landscape and weather.
2,Great Product!,"The whiteboard is posted on the side of the refrigerator for a family communication board. It erases clean, works great for our family. The only thing I am not happy with is that I thought the whole back would be sticky and not just a strip on the top and bottom. the corners aren't stuck to the fridge at all so they curl up a bit. You have to use a special tape that comes with the product to hold them down. Since I may want to move it around, I didn't use it. So although you can simply ""unroll and post"" as the ad represents, in order to post the product properly, there is another step involved. Overall, it's still a great product that we use on a daily basis."
1,Is this really fruit punch?,"These sticks did not taste like fruit punch at all- had a weird, not even fruit-like taste. would not recommend."
2,A very good TCP/IP book,"This book provides a very good study of TCP/IP in the context of Windows 2000. While the authors' style in on the dry side (How do you make this stuff exciting?); this is a VERY good book. The resource kit does have a book dealing with TCP, but its discussion is at a higher level - how is TCP/IP implemented in Windows 2000. The view there is from Windows to TCP/IP. This is a more general TCP/IP book with the emphasis from TCP/IP to Windows 2000. As a technical instructor and Windows NT and 2000 administrator, I refer to this book for low level disscusions of the protocol to clarify and explain the behavior of my systems."
2,The Gestapo,"The book contains many fact that I had not none. It is surprising where many of these came to light. It is very detailed and well researched. The back biting in the regime was always know known and is confirmed in this book. All in all it was a book which was hard to put down. Looking back at the horror, it is difficult to believe that this could happen in the las century."
2,I like Ray Boltz,"I bought this specifically to give to a friend, the first song ""Thank You"" was so meaningful for her. I had an older Ray Boltz album with the same song on it, and I ended up giving it to my friend. His singing of the song years ago was a much better version than this newer one."
2,One of the best CD's I've heard in the last few years!!,"Every now and then you buy a CD and WHAM! you can't stop listening to it. Listen to this album all the way through then listen to it all the way through again. I believe it's a masterpiece. This is one of the best bands around right now. Yeah, ""wall of sound"" and all. I've late to discover Wilco, mainly through ""Mermaid Avenue"" (one of the best CD's from last year), then found ""A.M."" at a 1/2-priced store and fell in love with that CD. I just can't get enough of ""SummerTeeth"". Great melodies (with at first bizarre off-sounding insturmentation that actually falls in to place everytime) lyrics that make you ponder, a theme running through the whole thing (or is there?)..... I'll take Wilco as the sparse alt.country sound of ""A.M."" and the Beach Boys/Beatles/XTC influenced layered sound of ""Summer Teeth"". Keep on truckin'! See everybody at the concert in San Antonio with R.E.M."
1,Not What I expected,"I thought there is more on the dvd. This is poor...The ""Making of"" Is not a Making Of. It is just a little blabla..."
2,Absolutely The Best!!!,This is absolutely the best message ever. I have this book and reread it often. I also give it out as a gift all the time. A must have!
1,Jill Ireland ruins the film.,"Mrs CB cannot act and because she has a big part the film is ruined by her, imho."
1,NOT FOR ME,"ON PAGE 258 THE AUTHOR SAYS "" ANY ATTEMPT TO FOLLOW THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT OF THE PRECEDING LECTURE IS BOUND, THEREFORE, TO MEET WITH OBSTACLES.THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP FOR ME. I TRIED VERY HARD TO STAY WITH THIS BOOK BUT NO DEAL.GENE ADDINGTON"
2,absolutely breathtaking,this is a wonderful C.D. My favorite tracks on it are Full of Grace and Gloomy Sunday. Gloomy Sunday is a song originally done by Billie Holiday and I think Sarah sings it just as good. I recommend this C.D as well as all of the other C.D's by Sarah. Each one has its own style and beauty.
1,limited,"I received this muffin pan for a gift. It's a nice pan in many ways but I would have never purchased it myself. First of all, the price is high. It's very heavy which has pros and cons...won't warp like super light-weight pans but when filled with batter it is really heavy. The ends are extended to provide handles but because of this it can only go in a standard oven length-wise. If you put it in side-by-side with another pan, it is too long and the door will not close. Lastly, it is only useful for muffins as the cups are not large enough to accommodate paper cupcake holders. The paper cups fold in and do not make nice round cupcakes. The positive is that the non-stick coating is nice and it produces beautiful muffins. All in all it's not a multipurpose pan, it's too heavy for my liking, it's too expensive and it takes up too much space in the oven...not a winner in my book. I suggest looking elsewhere."
1,the sleeper,red scarf girl is a horrible book. When we were reading it I fell asleep. Do you realy want to fall asleep when reading a book? If you do read this book. If not do NOT reead this book.
1,"Good group, disappointing collection","I'm sorry I cannot endorse the enthusiatic reviews below.I bought this CD based on the Baltimore Consort's fine, fun collection of Renaissance French tunes (La Rocque 'n' Roll"") and my own love of traditional Irish music. Perhaps I have been spoiled by too many Chieftains CDs, but I found only one tune here memorable, or even interesting: Custer LaRue's rendition of ""Catty (sic) Magee"" in Gaelic.If you like the Baltimore Consort (and Custer LaRue), get another CD of theirs. If you like traditional Irish music, try another group."
1,Dumb book,Proclaims to be the next DaVinci code but can't even carry DaVinci's water. Fails miserably to live up to its billing.
2,"My ""imprint"" set ...","so I'm maybe a little biased, but I love Ashkenazy's Sibelius. Yes, he makes it overly romantic at times, but the music can take it, and in some cases (like the ""difficult"" 7th) it needs it. The 6th in this set, which is my favorite work by the composer and my favorite recording by this conductor, is a stunning achievement. The weak link of Ashkenazy's Sibelius is the 4th from the other half of the complete set, but this pairing is excellent throughout."
1,Waste of time,"If you want to ""witnesss"" to one of Jehovah's Witnesses, do what Jesus commanded his followers to do, go out and preach and make disciples (Matt 28:19), and seek them out. If you are not interested, trust me it is not taken personally. Jehovah's Witnesses respect their neighbors and their beliefs. No organization has fought more for the first amendment rights, for everyone's benefit, not just their own. This book is a classic example of a bitter former JW, It's quit simple, in sports if you don't follow the rules, what happens? That's right you get disqualified or booted from the team. Likewise when God's high standards, outlined in his word are not adhered too, then that person is removed. Simple. The author, if he chose to not be one of Jehovah's Witnesses any longer, should first of all, stop being bitter and find something more productive to do with his time, as most former members should do also. (...)"
2,Texas Instruments TI-83,Great. No problems with it. Works good and came with everything it said it would.
2,Beautiful,"This is very pretty and reversable too, the other side being a black so it will match a lot of clothing. The only thing was it didn't come with a chain so finding one that the pendant will fit over is not looking to be easy. Pendant doesn't mean necklace so I should have read better."
1,Poison Propaganda,"that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels ""incomplete"" for new lovers (who will surely feel ""incomplete"".) Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood, slept with lots of losers, then everyone who could possibly advance her career, and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution. It's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none."
1,Quality of cooked rice went down after about 1.5 years,"For the price, I expected this unit to last longer than my parents' bigger and less expensive cooker (can't remember the brand of their rice cooker--either Panasonic or National) which they've used EVERYDAY for more than five years now, and it's still going.My family didn't use this Zojirushi everyday--but we were pretty close! After about a year and a half, the rice doesn't keep as well as it used to. It dries out faster and doesn't cook as evenly as it did while it was under warranty.I noticed most (if not all) the positive reviews were posted after recent purchases. The handful of reviews from folks who have owned and used this item beyond warranty isn't as glowing. Please keep that in mind if you envision using this rice cooker for years to come."
1,Awful Sci-Fi,"Poor writing, poorly acted. The typical modernday American style tripe where everyone behaves like an emotional little girl. It took 3 attempts for me to be able to finish the first part of the pilot. I'm actually not sure if I finished the second part, but I just don't care, it is garbage."
2,A literary accomplishment that deserves recognition.,"This book held a magnetic attraction to me because in it I found a variety of characters that touched my heart. The story is rich with ""socially redeeming value"". If you devote some time to it, it can help you be more aware of how different individuals respond to problems and situations that have captivated their lives. The writer provides you with vivid description and has devised means to help you walk with those who are suffering problematic situations including the plight of being a male or female unwed parent, surviving a natural disaster, living with mental health problems, being an aging male or female searching for happiness and many other situations that combine to portray humanity in the variety of cycles of living. The book takes a look at prejudice contrasted with genuine love. I highly recommend this book and could see it being reviewed in college classes who are studying authors who are new on the scene"
2,Memorial Day,Have read many of Vince Flynn's books and enjoyed them all. Memorial Day was the last one I read and it certainly did not disappoint. Had a difficult time putting it down. It was a thriller from start to finish.
1,Arrived Broken,"Product was made of flimsy plastic and arrived in many pieces. We never got to use it. Since no return information was included, we had no way to send it back or request a replacement."
2,It was a wonderful book as a teenager and it still is now!,"Like many of your other reader-reviewers, I read Katherine when I was a teenager - I was transported to a by-gone world and suddenly my history lessons came alive. What a wonderful experience (and what a great way to learn about history). Katherine is an exceptional novel - far more involved than your usual ""romance"" novels. I can only hope that Ms. Seton's publisher continues to print all of her books for a long, long time!!"
2,OVERKILL: Got a fistful of reason,"Overkill is still churning out great albums after 20+ years. This is one of Overkill's better releases to date. Blitz is a thrashing, unrelenting force throughout every song. From ""Damned"" to ""I rise"" this album kicks you in your candyass from beginning to end. They've shuffled the lineup through the years but still seem to get better with age. NO compromises. It's time to Shrreeeeeedd!"
1,Movie dialog ruins this jazz album,I sought out this CD because it contains a couple of songs by Sting not available on any of Sting's CDs.The remaining album cuts are jazz instrumentals. It would have been a fine CD except some person must have decided it would cute to add movie dialog to the intros of must of the cuts.It's not a pleasant experience.
1,Review from a native speaker,I really don't know why this book received so many good reviews. I was unable to find many basic words.
2,Good quality set,I think these a very good set of gauges. The hoses are long enough for any reach that you might need.
1,"Lukewarm, metal tasting coffee","I purchased this coffee maker for the size and style but was very unhappy with it. Even when first brewed, the coffee isn't hot and there's a strong taste of metal in the coffee. Several washings in hot soapy water and several pots of coffee did nothing to get rid of the metal taste. I'm definitely throwing this coffee pot BACK."
1,No NON,"Monotonic dribble. This is definatly the ... NON release so far, asides ""Might"". I can only recommend NON's ""God and Beast"" or ""Easy listening to the Iron Youth"". If you are looking for a good noise, look for titles from Merzbow, Painjerk, Deathpile, Whitehouse, Masonna and others. NON is way too over-rated."
1,Stopped working less than a year old,"We really loved the look of it and it did the job (albeit slower than our 20+ year old not-so-pretty toaster), but in its last months alive, the spring that keeps the food in the toaster stopped working and you had to hold it down continuously. Then it just stopped working all together. At that time we had bought three different items made by Hamilton Beach and each one malfunctioned much earlier than even a ""cheaper"" product would. You are much better off paying less for a different brand unless you are cool with having to replace everything regularly. HB just doesn't make things to last.In general many products nowadays are made to not last as long as they used to (we actually bought two of this toaster with that in mind; the second one is already starting to show the spring issue). But with the amount of money you have to pay for this product you would think it would have lasted long enough to get some value out of it. You are better off buying a $15 toaster."
1,"I didn't get Techno Bears, I got standard Haribo bears","The product I got, the standard Haribo Golden Bears, get five stars. I didn't order Haribo Golden Bears, I ordered the Techno Bears. Pretty disappointing, be careful about ordering."
2,Who doesn't love the Hollies?,"If you grew up in the 60's and 70's most of what you heard was that incredible music from the ""British Invasion"" groups. Those were fantastic times!! One of my all time favorite groups from those years was, and still is the Hollies! If you love listening to real music, and especially love really good harmonies, then you will love the Hollies greatest hits! It may not include all of their great music, but it sure is a start!! All of it digitally remastered!"
1,Don't read this book!!!,I received this book as a Christmas present and was excited to read it. I did not like the way it made me feel while I read it and my wife thought I was acting strangely during that two week period. I had no religious convictions at the time of reading but still felt that it was inspired by evil and it still leaves me with a sick feeling in my stomach. I will read no more of Anne Rice's novels as result and recommend against reading her work.
1,All wrong,"This book is the antithesis of what I consider normal, healthy eating habits. What the author doesn't realize is that dieting only perpetuates overeating. Most people can only live with such restrictions for awhile before they go crazy and EAT EAT EAT. The only solution is to return to natural eating ... and believe me, you WILL lose weight. I weigh 105 lbs and I got here by eating whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. There is a fabulous book called ""The 7 Secrets of Slim People"" and it explains how to give up dieting forever. It's the best thing I've ever done!"
1,BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING !,"First of all this Collector's Edition of No Country For Old Men is NOT a 3 disc set as the advertising reads. There are only two and if you buy a used copy the digital disc won't work because the original customer used the code. I'm trying to get Lions Gate to give me a new code but I haven't heard from them yet. There are several things in the way this product is described that isn't true or confusing at best. It advertises over FIVE HOURS of special features. IF there is, it must be on the digital disc because it isn't on the blu-ray and there isn't a third disc. You might want to wait to see if Amazon will clean up the descriptions of the different versions of the movie."
1,This book is fragmented and confusing.,"I have been unsuccessful in learning VB from this book. If there is a structured approach to programming then I think there should be a structured approach to learning programming and this book does not have it. I find myself referencing other text books when I want to understand the topic being discussed, or as the authors have us do all to often, the help guide. I will be happy to sell this book back at the end of the semester."
2,"Everyone remembers, 'Summer Rain' an all time great.","It was in the early '70 that I first listened to Johnny Rivers. Noticing the strange cover photo (Realization), I would pulled the LP out of my bothers record box and play the LP over and over saying; ""this is good stuff!"". `Summer Rain' being my favorite, this is very good stuff here.""We sailed into the sunsetDrifted home caught by a gulf streamNever gave a thought for tomorrowJust let tomorrow be, now, let tomorrow be""(writen by James Hendricks)"
1,A bit dissapointing,"I work as a flower designed specially with brides bouquets. It is a beautiful book with gorgeous photos, but the bouquets presented are mainly conventional. If you are looking for inspiration and new ideas on bouquets, I would not say this is the book for you."
1,murder set peices,look to be fair i have not seen the loins gate version but reading the reviews its been cut to ribbons msp must be seen in an ucut form yes it does shock it does have some images that are taboo like the child stabbing which is disturbing but it is a film and they are actors again watch it uncut its a punch to your senses
1,"Item good, packaging not so good","Box was totally inadequate. Split on two corners, badly banged up all around. Fortunately each battery was wrapped in bubble wrap so they are not on their way back (yet). (June 2012)"
1,Just for nostalgia...,"Was very excited when I got this. Memories of when I was younger playing endless Atari games with friends and family, evenings full of fun and enjoyment. I had high hopes but alas my memories were a lot better than the experience of this unit. I was underwhelmed and somewhat deflated. It was really boring overall, Centiped was a good game but the rest were not as good as I recalled. Also I seemed to have issues playing on an LCD TV, had to revert to old CRT TV which it worked fine with. I only paid $5 of Craigslist for the unit so I don't feel too bad. If I spent $30 or more I would be upset. 2 out of 5 for the memories :-)"
1,Lasted about 3 hours,I purchased two of these and one only lasted about 3 hours. When I went to get out of my truck I twisted which pulled on the clip and pulled the whole thing apart. I don't think I will even bother to put on the second one. I have been doing a bit of reading and saw that someone posted that you could use a baby pacifier clip to replace original clips on pedometer leashes. I found some pretty sturdy looking ones on ebay and am waiting for them now. Don't bother with this product.
1,Disappointing,"I needed to have a clear bag for work. But the mesh on the front got torn after only a few days and it wasn't long until the mesh pocket was just unusable. To top it off, the bag itself now has tears and holes in it. Durable is the exact opposite of what I would describe this product as. I do not recommend it. I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews."
2,Wall Street: The Street Worth Billions,"100 Years of Wall Street is one of the greatest books ever written. Its in depth analysis of the history of Wall Street is remarkable. It is an essential to anyone that is learning more about investments, yet it is still quite enjoyable without knowing anything about the subject. This is truly a remarkable read, and I would recommend it with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind my back!"
1,Connection Fails,I have owned three of these and all three have done the same thing. Afer a month or so the light works intermittently and you have to shake it or hit it with the palm of your hand to get it to work. It seems like there is a loose connection or something. If it didnt have this issue I would give the light a great review but since all of the ones I have had failed in the same way it falls short of being a solid tool in my opinion.
2,Great for inspiring fashion illustrators,Okay so it took me FOREVER to find and buy this book only to find out its the samd as Borrelli's Stylishly Drawn...and I mean EXACTLY like it nothings different aobut the 2.Despite that I love the illustrations in it. They are very very very inspiring and helpful to fashion students and illustrators alike. ENJOY!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! IT IS A RIP-OFF!,Blu-Ray Should contain both versions period! I will not FEED THE PIG with this release! They ought to be ashamed of themselves!
1,"Worked Well For Year, Now It Doesn't Work at All","I bought this heater almost exactly 1 year ago and based my decision on the reviews at Consumer Reports. The heater worked very well from the start and did a great job of heating my spot in the office that is always very cold during the winter.However, about 2 weeks ago, the heater started shutting off for no apparent reason and it would take quite awhile to get it to restart. Today, I can't get it to do anything. The power light lights up, but the fan does not run and the unit does not heat up, no matter what setting I choose.Since I bought it directly from Amazon, I'm hopefull (based on other reviews) that I'll be able to return or exchange it without much hassle. Fingers crossed."
2,Total Recall,"I'm really enjoying an old classic. The DVD is in great condition, just as described. Thank you for an amazing product."
2,Chick Metal meets Slipknot,"Of course the singles ""Ghost Flowers"" and ""Crooked Spoons"" are great - both spooky and energetic - but the whole album flows pretty well. Would've given it 5 stars, but I'm not a fan of their cover of Nirvana's ""breed"" which seemed woefully out of place and whose execution was workmanlike at best. Recommended if you like kittie, slipknot, marilyn manson, or mudvayne."
2,nice little tripod,"Bought this tripod for my girlfreind's Canon 870 IS, and it works as advertised. It is quite a bit smaller than I thought it was, but in a good way. It would be easy to fit this tripod in a women's purse, along with the camera. It provides fairly firm support for the camera, and has a quick release mechanism for extended tripod work if needed. All in all, a nice accessory for any point-n-shoot camera owner."
2,Great performance and not a system hog like Norton,"This product was easy to install and use. The only problem was figuring out why I could not add a network printer to my laptop. Checked the Live One Care web site and found a simple setting adjustment and now it works great. I am not ready to download IE7 yet, too many reported problems, so my status never shows green but know everything else is protected. Got it at a great price on Amazon too. So far, so good. Time will tell if it really lives up to its potential. Still use Ad-aware and find a lot more spyware than Defender stops."
1,Very disappointed!,The scenery was beautiful. When Wes Studi was talking at least there were subtitles translating what he was saying but the entire DVD was NOT subtitled/closed captioned. Thus a waste of my time and money - reason for my poor rating -- I could not understand what was being said. :(
1,Very disappointing,"The 4 agreements are interesting in themselves, and I looked them up on Google a while back to get a basic explanation of them. The book was far less useful than the Google search. I was hoping that it might explain why these 4 agreements were chosen over other possibilities - why these 4 are so fundamental. It does nothing of the sort."
2,IT WORKS!,What else could you ask from an HDMI cable? Cheap and functional. Do not hesitate in purchasing this phenomenally functional product!
2,So beautiful,"So beautiful, no further comments required. Felt in love with the little boy. A great job, seriously. Blah blah blah (word count requirement)"
1,it broke and they don't honor their warranty,"I bought this tv around the first of October and used it for two weeks, then suddenly the screen was filled with colored lines and I couldn't get a picture. I contacted Olevia, or Syntax Brillian and they said they would replace it right away, But it took two weeks just to get the return lable and that was by email. After I shipped it back they promised to send the new replacement no later than November 12th, but no TV. I have called 2 dozen times since but they usually just hang up after making you listen to the same Kenny G song for a half hour or more. I finally got through to someone this past Monday Nov. 26th and they promised to have it shipped no later than Wednesday the 28th along with a email confirming shipment, two days later and hours more of Kenny G and I'm still waiting. If you have $500 to throw away, dump it in the stock market, that way at least you'll have a nice certifcate, if you buy Olevia you end up with nothing. Gerald S. Wight"
2,FABULOUS!!,This is the ONLY tub to buy..... My son used it to 10 months but loved the bath time so much he wanted the reg tub to move around.... He loved the security of the hammock and so did I for my own piece of mind... the more expensive ones are gimmicks.. You don't need them... this gets you by just fine!!!!
2,FIGHT CLUB CAUSES AND CURES CONSUMERISM,What can I write about a movie I've seen at least 20 times in the last two months and spent over $300 on for a digitial movie player and DVD and VHS versions just so I could own it myself!From the first viewing I couldn't stop telling others about this mind bending trip through one man's consumer hell. Or about the solution to his problem personified by Tyler Durden. Not to mention the just-above-street-person-level character Marla who survives the trip and lives to tell about it. Maybe I am so intrigued because I am like the nameless narrator - looking for answers and finding them just below the surface of denial.As a forty-one year old Christian woman I don't take my movies lightly. This is not a movie you will forget.
1,Not impressed,"Not impressed with this product. The relief it gives does not last. It is rare that I can spray with this right before I sing, and by the time I do sing, I don't get any relief with it."
1,Do not buy!!!!!!!,Do not buy this vaporizer. It is a very noisy vaporizer. It makes a loud bubbling and blowing sound. It sprayed water out all over my hard wood floors and took the finish off the floor.
2,Murphy's Trail-Worth the Ride,"I found this book to be a good authentic action packed western. Murphy is tough, likeable and believeable as a New Mexico Sheriff . The author knows what hes talking about as for as guns and horses and it was a good story.I would recomend this book to other western fans and Ill be looking for other Murphy books."
1,Didn't work at all for me.,"As luck would have it, the day I got this bottle of Quite Defense, I was starting Day 1 of the flu. I took it as directed, but I didn't get better any quicker than I normally do."
1,Truth stood on its head. Disinformation source material,"As an example of what a the intelligence community can produce to undermine the self-determinism of a developing country this would get six stars. As a history book it should rate a minus five for perfect nonsense, but that's not available.Where another intelligence community journalist, Michael Norton (AP) can be described -- in 2000 -- as being a ""pro-Aristide journalist"" you know why Jesse Helms chose this publication for much of his anti-Lavalas vitriol. Lynn Garrison is a Mythomaniac of the first order. Of course he was only doing what he was paid to do, as was Mr. Norton. I was fortunate enough to be able to get this from the ironically named Goodwill Bookstore for a pittance.This particular publication can be held responsible for the violent death of many Haitian martyrs. It's really that toxic."
1,Easy to break into,"These locks are jokes. I can get into one in about 30 seconds to a minute. All u have to do is pull on the shackle, listen closely as you turn each dial, When it's on the right one it clicks loud. Mine wasn't just a fluke either because I've tested this with several. If you want a reasonably safe lock, skip this. All most as easy as a TSA Aproved key lock."
2,Undiscovered Treasure,"I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms."
1,Multiple Problems- not worth it,"We bought this fountain only about a year ago and have completely stopped using it because it was such a pain to keep working. After about a month of working the water reservoir stopped draining, even when completely full. We tried everything to get it to drain, but eventually just decided to take the reservoir out and manually fill it everyday. For most of the year then we have been just filling it a couple times a day, which was annoying, especially when the pump would start sucking air in the middle of the night. After one of these middle of the night episodes, my husband unplugged it and refuses to use it anymore. I would never recommend this pet water fountain to anyone and was very disappointed with the whole thing. Only half of my cats wanted to use it anyway."
2,"Hey, Read J David Moeller's true account of seeing a ghost...Pg 54","I loved this book. Of course, I loved my story, ""A Distinct Odor of Blood"" on page 54...but I also loved the simplicity and honesty of the writing in the other 99 stories. No one was trying for the Pulitzer, they were just recounting their experiences. Simple, down to earth writing and story telling. A must-have on any book lover's shelf!"
2,Hands Down the Best Live Album of All Time,"Once Again, a broad claim. But, this truly is the best. Before My personal Favorite was ""It's Alive"" by The Ramones (With ""Where's the 10 1/2"" by Black Flag coming in a close second) but this album blows both of those away. I personally always preferred to Peter Tosh to Marley after the Wailers, and this is one of the reasons why. The actual sound is incredibly crisp, clean, and sounds better than in the studio. Now most of the time, I don't believe in live albums being superior in any way to recordings- there very rarely is any extra energy in live recordings. This is one of the exceptions. You can almost cry when you ear the beautiful, passionate energy coming out of his speakers. An essential to any Roots Reggae compilation."
1,More damn cg blood.,"This will be short and to my point. From the title and pictures you know what your in for. I am so damn tired of the cg blood. It is so obvious when it shows up because it's not the same color as the rest of the blood and it's shiny. The cg kills are a joke. Watch the Midnight Meat Train and you'll see what I mean. The only way this works for me is if the movie is 3D because you want the blood to jump out so it doesn't have to look realistic. In Saw 4 or 5 not sure, they have a dude getting crushed by 2 moving walls. As soon as he gets it cg blood squirts al over. In the making of they said they built a prostetic arm and crushed. Then why use cg. It doesn't enhance it. Just built fake body parts and use buckets of blood not from a computer. Anything that this movie did have going for it was ruined because it had english voice overs. Americans (I am one) can't do the japanese anime type of voice acting. I wouldn't rent it if I were you."
1,Too much paper wasted on the back story,"Interesting idea, good characters.. But it took eighteen pages to give the reader the set up for the story, which for me, is way to long. Then once the action gets going, which is the only thing that moves the story, there's more and more and more back story. Maybe it's just McKinley's style as I writer that I find fault with. I want to be thrust into the action, and then have to figure it out along the way as the story unfolds, giving the reader a little back story as it moves along. Otherwise, I feel to bogged down, and plain bored. So, I skimmed a lot of it, just to get to the stuff that didn't bore me.For vampires, I prefer J.R. Ward, Kim Harrison, Laurell K. Hamilton, Mary Janice Davidson (Queen Betsey series), Keri Arthur (Riley series), (Morganville Vampires) Rachael Caine, or Rob Thurman (Cal Leandros series)."
2,"Wusthof Classic 10"" Chef's knife","I bought this knife based on the Wusthof name. Well balanced, will probably outlive me. A joy to use, but people strapped for cash would probably be happy with a Forschner (Victorinox) knife with a stamped blade. I have one of those and it cuts as well as the Wusthof (but isn't as pretty!). Although I haven't used a lot of different knives, this one certainly feels first class. I would recommend this in a heartbeat to those that can afford it."
1,beginners Armenian,"Totally useless for my purposes. It does not indicate whether it is Eastern or western Armenian, the Armnenian type is MUCH too small and VERY difficult to read, no indication of pronuciation, and no accent marks to indicate where the stress falls on the syllables. Armenian script should be much clearer and bigger for beginners."
1,not too swift,"Althought the love they feel for the child they adopt in this really really dense children's story is evident in every syllable, as a mother of a Chinese daughter and hopefully mother of more Chinese daughters, I am really disappointed that the authors would chose to openly disclose to China their homosexual relationship. China demands you sign a SWORN statement of ""non=homosexuality"". While unthinkable to most Americans, this is a demand of a rigid government with no sense of humor whatsoever. To OPENLY flout a casual attitude for a sworn statement could jeopardize future adoptions for many children. The Chinese do not like to be disparaged or be made fools of. Think about the broader consequences of telling your tale in print."
2,Dayco Serpentine Belt,"When my car was inspected they said the serpentine belt needed replacing and they would do it for ""just $80.00"". This Dayco belt was shipped to my home using my prime account for just under $18.00. This belt is great and I saved 62 dollars over the inspection location."
1,Lasted one year,"After just over a year of using this lock, it no longer stays connected for me. On more than one occassion, I have locked it around the seat on my scooter while riding home and in the middle of the ride it will just pop open. When I went to unlock my scooter yesterday, I didn't need to bother. The lock had openned up on its own and was just laying on the ground next to my scooter. For a lot less money, I could have just gotten a normal bike lock that would do a better job."
2,HARD TO FIND,IV BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS SET FOR YEARS. I JUST STUMBLED ON TI BY ACCIDENT AND HAD TO BUY IT. IM ALSO LOOKING FOR FREANKIE VALLI TIMELESS IN CD COLLECTORS EDITION IF ANYONE HAS ANY INFO ON THAT CONTACT ME @BOZZ2@AOL.COM
1,"Great, but unreliable","This pressure cooker worked great the 6 or 7 times I used it. Don't expect a quick-release like you'd get when putting a pressure cooker under cold running water, though, so subtract a few minutes from the cooking time.Unfortunately, my Russell Hobbs pressure cooker died while I was standing in front of it. All the lights went out and that was it. Search for ""Russell Hobbs pressure cooker review"" and you will find a few other instances of this happening to other people. Hopefully they are isolated instances, because I know of other folks who own this cooker (also listed as Cook's Essentials) and who have had it for some time without incident."
1,Puritanical Dribble,"The experiential side of the Christian life is left to those who do not share in the Old Calvinists ideals of the Puritan fathers. Of course, we are wrong headed and completely responsible for the lack of morals and the modern landscape of irrelavence in Christianity. Modern thought and any theology this side of the first Great Awakening are anathema that must be thoroughly purged from the pulpits of America so that we can return to the utopian ideals of Wenham and their cloistered Congregationalists babble. I sincerely hope Professor Wells is not as arrogant about the heresies of other less-puritan views of the church's role in our society when he lectures in class. At least he has done me the service of eliminating a possible sight for more research."
2,"Easy, Perfect for Me.","An 84 year old friend of mine recommended this video because she said she could do it and it has helped her balance. I agree. It was very easy to follow. The other videos I have tried were too complicated for me. I tried a class at the Y but I could not keep up. Other people don't like this video because it is too easy but it is perfect for me. John Bright-Fey is a very friendly instructor and I can understand him! His book, A Morning Cup of Tai Chi, gives additional instructions which I find very beneficial. I highly recommend both products!"
1,thanks for the 3days it worked,"I was very disappointed with this bike. I wasted $200.00 on somehting my 8yr old son really wanted and when it worked for the first 3 days, it was great!! I loved it for him!! But then, it wouldn't charge and I returned it (...) for my money back. Very disappointed with having to take it back. I would not recommend it for anyone else."
2,NICE! NICE! REALLY REALLY NICE!,This cd is really nice for romantic evenings and something to help rekindle those flams of passion. All around just a great buy.
1,not working,The cable stopped working one month after I bought it. Thats all. I have to write five more words to post.
2,good quick delivery,I am using this for my dog. She loves it and eats it like dog biscuits. I do not know if it helps.
2,Contemporary Asian Bedrooms (Contemporary Asian Home),It's typically and exclusively fantastic book. It helps me decorate my home in Asian style. Highly recommend it to all readers and Asian-styled fans.
2,Es un excelente video para principiantes,"Desde que lo he comenzado a seguir me siento con más vitalidad, más disposición para hacer ejercicios e incluso siento que mi cuerpo busca permanentemente una mejor postura. Lo recomiendo."
1,not good!,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, it points out the obvious and will bore you to death!"
2,"On the cruelty of men, but also people in general","This is a great flick about the reasons people are cruel and manipulate others: simply, because they can. Aaron Eckhart does a great job playing the main character,Chad, a man that will make you hate all men. But, what I took away from this was not only how cruel men can be, but people in general. This movie is about more than misogyny. And, it's great to watch just for Eckhart's performance alone. BOTTOM LINE: It's not cheezy, there's no fancy music to sway you to one side or the other. It's, instead, a dark look at men and politics in the corporate world, full of simple yet telling dialogue, definetly worth a watch. GRADE: B+"
1,Just Ok,"This series is kinda lame because it doesn't really teach things, it shows u something like 2 times and says practice"
2,Also eagerly awaiting the next installment....,"The reviewer who awarded this book one star obviously never glanced at a traditional stanza of ancient Egyptian poetry, where you will often find references to various gods ""in this Your Name of"" followed by the name of another god (i.e., ""O Isis, in this Your Name of Mut...."")! The importance of the ren -- or the name -- is not of Rev. Siuda's invention; it's a common theme in Egyptian theology. It will be very interesting to see the next installment of this work -- I'm looking forward to it after this one!"
2,good book,"I really like that book: the story is great and there is a lot of suspence. But this book needs a sequel because there is no end of the story in this book. L'amour creates a character outside of the common who can adapt himself anywhere, anytime with his experience. Major Joe Black is an Indian but he went to college. I recommend this book for all persons who like adventure and suspense."
1,A whole lot of fluff and a little bit of information!,"While this has the potential to be a decent series, it bombards you with advertising for itself constantly. Presented in a 6 week study format, even from the ""scence selection"" option it forces you to watch, yet again, a commercial-like introduction for the Deeper Connections series. After getting through 4 weeks of this, and all of us knowing the theme song in the commercial, we had enough and banished it to the closet and started in on a new Rob Bell video.If you can make it though the commercials weekly, you then get to listen to a dramatic reading of the scripture, followed by some decent reflections from different theologians. The content isn't that bad but probably only amounts to about 40% of the actual DVD, the rest is just fluff!By the way, if you haven't tried Rob Bell, he's great! We always have the most people in attendance when we announce that we will be using his DVD's."
1,2 cats show no interest,I put this out for them and all they do is walk around it. Theyll jump over it on occasion but the cats solely prefer my couch and office chair. Even the catnip didnt work. Might as well have thrown some dirt on the thing.
1,Come on - This guys a con man!,Get real everybody. This guy is being investigated for murder due to his greed and incompetence in the sweat lodge deaths.
1,Not Drifters,I did not enjoy the music - Nothing close to the original drifters - Too much improvising - should have tried to sound like the originals
2,Good Dance Album To Dance To!,"I bought this CD as soon as it came out, and I am very happy with it. Each song has a good beat to it, packed with girlish vocals. The only bad thing about this CD is that there are too many interludes, and not enouth songs. Some of these interludes are kind of pathetic, but I like the Eible French Chick one.Overall, this CD is pretty good, so buy it!"
1,"Works well if you like intermittent, brief spurts of water.","I got this product for my birthday. My partner thought it was a whole set up, complete with bowl. What arrived was only the pump. Our first Smart Solar SunJet 150 Solar-powered water pump did not work. We requested a replacement. This next one only worked (sort of - read on) when the solar panel was in full sun (no clouds). There were short 1/2 second bursts of water as the little fountain putt putt putted and spluttered along. It actually made me laugh, the water stream was so brief and intermittent. I wondered why anyone would want such a product? OK, so we did...but why? The company has since informed us that they had a ""bad batch"" and will send us a third replacement. I am not holding my breath."
1,Too much theological BS,Just a big bore. No anointing on it. It's going to the local libray book sale. Maybe you can get it there.
1,Ridiculus!,"First of all: 1- This is not the Jerry Golsdmith's score and this music doesn't have the Power of the first tree films, never! 2- This is a Primitive score with ridiculus Choral voices 3- The music doesn't fit in the film 4- Jonathan Sheffer use the same style of Danny Elfman, but this is not Elfman, Elfman and Goldsmith are realy Better...Buy first tree soundtracks"
2,going green with biokleen,We've decided to start doing our part by switching all of our cleaning products over to products that are better for the environment.With Amazon Prime we were able to save a lot of money buyng biokleen powder in bulk. It smells great and cleans pretty well. Every now and then I have to re wash a glass due to soap that stuck on the glass. Also it would be nice if the detergent came with a measuring spoon. (Even one spoon per case that can be reused would be nice) I ended up just using a plastic teaspoon which I broke in half so it would fit into the jar. Overall I feel great using a detergent that is better on the environment and it cleans just as well as my old detergent.
2,"Liked the book, disliked the author","Satisfying literary thrillers don't come along too often, so I'm grateful to Colin Harrison for his combination of complex plotting, subtle characterization, and good writing. I did like this novel overall, but it was in spite of its endless, arrogant philosophizing and its offensive sexuality. I don't recall ever being offended by a book in this way before--the female characters' sexuality bears no resemblance to that of real women--it's clearly one giant fantasy on the part of the author."
1,Stick with No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency,I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.I could not finish it. I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't. I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it. So I traded it in at a local used book store.I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress. The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody. I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book. And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book. It was very disappointing.
1,Bad Costumer Care,"Sell Sell Sell. That's what they really want only!!! ... I needed my book faster. I sent an email right before ordered it, saying that I wanted something faster, or I needed to cancel. Of course it was my fault of not seeing that they were from Europe, it was going to take 2 weeks but, there was no understanding AT ALL. Never buying with them anymore!!!"
1,"2007's edition of HappyEnds was not happy at all: different fit, and stiff leather!","Last year, finally having found my perfect sand-color summer walking shoe, eroneously I thought, that I would be able to reorder the same sandle year after year. Just as one can do with Bass sandles. Not so! What a disappoinment!As I took the offendending, ill-fitting pair back to the store, I was reassured by the shop assistant that I was not alone in my gripes about this ""new and not improved"" edition of that sandle.I was given the 1-800 number to complain to the buyers. But do they listen??Wouldn't you think that such a large company as Easy Spirit would invest in quality control and make sure the shoes they sell are consistent in style and well made from year to year.My sister-in-law echoes my remarks on the same sandles, too. No happy end for these."
1,Irreverent View of America,"The authors of this book are anxious to describe the follies and pure idiocy of our American History. It is pursued with an almost zealous irreverence. What are the solutions....the actions.... that politicians should take? If politicians listened to the authors in this book, then Presidents would do nothing but stand aside, and allow the world to take its own path.The authors actually expose themselves by asking, ""If democracy was such a good idea, why did people put up with other forms of government for so many hundreds of years?""This comment, among others, reveals their disdain not just for America, but for democracy in general. These pious economists exercise their democratic freedoms on a daily basis. These very freedoms would not be available for them to abuse if our forefathers had actually believed this type of nonsense."
2,Brilliant and doesn't keep me awake!,I take this tea when I feel snuffly like I am just about to get a cold and it does wonders. I catch no cold and the symptoms disappear within a day. Brilliant stuff.
1,WebCam,Ordered two webcams as a gift for my husband and could not activate the sound on either one. No trouble shooting instructions on package directions.
2,Tab Hunter...at his very best!!!,"Much has been said about Tab Hunter....bad and good. As for his movies....I think he defined his generation. His acting, as viewed today, was always convincing. Who the devil wants Lawrence Oliver all the time....and Tab was so MUCH better looking.His singing is honest and sincere...and the arrangements on this album is a good as you can get. He does a great job on all cuts.Wish he had made more albums...but alas...rock and roll ruined that as it ruined all music. This is only my opinion.Get this album...especially if you are a Tab Hunter fan. You want be disapointed."
2,Disney Swimming Nemo,This fish is so adorable and it has been a huge hit in the bath tub and outside in the pool! Highly recommend for those Nemo fans!!!!!! Very Happy!!!
1,Poor Supplier Management,"Melissa and Doug should be embarrassed. Either they are getting too big to care or they are too small to know any better, either way I ordered this product and it was shipped to me with only about 70% of the parts. Really, how does this even pass weight inspection to get shipped? Where is the QC?Melissa and Doug? Maybe Scrooge and The Grinch! This was going to be my hero present this year...thanks a lot."
2,Tire Tread Depth Gauge,"This is a great product. Assuming it is accurate, it does what it is supposed to do, and much better than Mr. Lincoln. I looked everywhere for one of these."
1,Loyal Coyle Fan Expect More,"Normally Harold Coyle is such a good read it is hard to put the book down. As a serving military officer, I was looking forward to the subject matter of this book for several months. In my opinion the book fell short of my expectations for an author of his caliber. I got the feeling that the book was written as a labor of love for the first 150 pages and then was shelved for a period of time before it had to be finished in a hurry. Readers need to know up front that the book will fall short of expectations in the end. The book even had some editing and proofing errors that are not normally seen in his work. Normally Harold Coyle's books exceptionally balances the drama of fiction with military realism to a very high degree. This one lost out to drama in a several ways. I will continue to look forward to his next effort, but I will not jump as quickly to buy it as I did this one."
2,Snow White and the Huntsman,"This was a great movie,Charlize Theron as the witch stepmother was just down right frighting. She deserves every award she wins for her acting skills, I fear for anyone with a stepmother like her. I hate the way the movie ended though, maybe they left it wide open like that to make room for the sequel. From the rumors they are not going to use Kristen Stewart, that would be a shame because I would like to see the battle between the Huntsman and William for Snow's heart."
2,great cover,I like this cover . The color was richer and better than I expected. The zipper is only on 2 sides but this is not a problem for us. Material seems durable and is of good quality.
2,Interesting,"This book is interesting and gives a new way of learning how to make your hands work for you. ASL is a complex language, this book is adding to the fun of learning this language while teaching the basic skills needed to achieve conversation."
1,Horrible!,"Now, first off, I love BSG, have all the discs. I picked up Virtuality when I went to buy The Plan. they were having a deal where if you bought The Plan you could get Virtuality for only $5.00! So, since Moore was involved in it, I figured its probably pretty good. Boy was I disappointed.This movie is one of the WORST I have ever seen! It takes forever before one even gets faintly interested in it. Im sorry, but it is a total waste. Thank God I only wasted $5.00 on this junk. It is an extremely boring movie. I tried to see the good in it, but its a waste of time. Its like a cross between Big Brother & Survivor in space! The plot is silly, and SPX are no better than 20 years ago.Dont waste your time in this movie.This movie is one I will literally throw in the trash! I dont see how anyone can give this movie more than 2 stars at best!I guarantee it will put you to sleep within a half hour!"
2,On my Hi Point .380,"Love it. Best thing you can add to a small pistol, especially if you have big hands. I wear a size 2x glove and have trouble with most concealable weapons, this helps immensely."
1,Annoying overheating that shuts down the machine without warning.,This machine is upgradeable Vista except for one missing driver which doesn't affect anything. Cetainly not worth $800. I replaced mine with a brand new Satellite A135-S4656 for $350! This replacement is tough and I lug it around quite a bit.
1,TOTAL POISON DISS,"Ok, you're right. I just now created an account. I just want everyone to know, this is a Poison diss!!! Hilary is SO SO SO SO RUDE!!!! I actually was a Hilary fan, but this flip-flopped my mind. I can NOT BELIEVE she's dissing one of the biggest bands of the 80's, something Hilary probably could never accomplish.Ok, about the album, it's ok. She not that seriously talented. Some of these songs weren't singles, let alone hit. I'd back off this."
1,Rubbish,"I actually thought that Ellen would be funnier. This is just rambling nonsence. Just as though she has scribbled down the first thing that came to mind. Not for me, I'm affraid. I couldn't get through it at all."
2,Unique and way cool,"This is just one of the coolest stories I've ever read. To me (Gen-X male college-graduate), it stands out not so much for its interesting philosophical/political undertones (overtones?), but for timeless human-interest content penned in Ayn Rand's clean and balanced writing style. It's not verbose so as to bog you down in fluffy details, yet I could still richly visualize every scene in the book. The characters are very memorable, and Rand did an excellent job of extrapolating the consequences of the choices made in their youth and early-adulthood, throwing in enough twists and turns to keep the development of their lives very interesting, which is a very fortunate thing, because when you first pick this book up it will seem forever."
1,could have been better,"THIS IS ...GOOD FOR FANS WHO LIKE THE POPULAR STUFF, BUT DIE HARD FANS THE ONLY VIDEOS THAT ARE EXCITING ARE HUMANS BEINGS AND THE LIVE DREAMS, NOTHING ELSE IS RARE , THAT YOU HAVENT RECORDED A 1000'S TIMES OFF MTV. THERS A LOT MISSING INCLUDING THE BLUE ANGELS DREAMS VIDEO AND QUITE A FEW OTHERS (NOTABLY 111). GEEZ THEY COULD OF PUT ON SOME OLD LIVE VH STUFF, TO BE INTERESTING OR HAVE SOME INTERVIEWS.TIMES LIKE THESE I WISH I WAS A KISS OR BONJOVI FAN , THEY GET MULTIPLE VIDEOS WITH EACH ALBUMS, AND SEEM TO PUT SOME EFFORT INTO THEM .SINCE DAVE LEFT THE ENTERTAINMENT HAS DIED."
2,Poignant Mastery,"The voices are verily realistic. Their slang is captured with the author's skilful ear and concise writing. They are two gentlemen being attentive to their younger counterpart at a tiny news agency on a small island. The schooling is unique and the girl has to use all her senses to determine the flow and outcome of the mystery being told. Taking place on an island the rule differs from the mainland, the girl quickly realizes. She listens with great interest about two teenagers finding a dead man on a beach. Dave and Vince take turn narrating where questions from the youngest of the three are welcomed and duly answered. It is up to Stephanie to fill in the blanks alongside the reader. The lively banters in the language of the locals prod the storytelling forward with magnificent ease of smoothness. Mr. King has come a long way in capturing his audience's curiosity and this time it is no exception. Nevertheless, the ending might not satisfy a lot of people."
2,All you need to know,"I'm no big fan of the Clintons, but this book, which is totally documented, leaves no doubt that Hillary Clinton was not exaggerating when she accused a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" of attempting to destroy her husband and her. What is truly shocking, however, is how the press (and we're not talking Matt Drudge here, but the most prestigious newspapers and magazines) joined in to create the impression of Watergate-type scandals based on the flimsiest--or even no--evidence at all. this is an invaluable book."
2,A great read!!,This book is a unique mix of science & story telling. Really fun to read...plus you learn something about the world we live in.
2,Stunning Brahms First Piano Concerto,"I agree with all the rave reviews about this classic recording of Brahms First Piano Concerto. But so far no one has mentioned the technical aspect of this recording which makes it so stunning. If you are used to the Columbia recordings of Szell/Cleveland made in Severance Hall, you will be shocked by the close miking of the piano and the orchestra in this recording. The result in an ""in-your-face"" musical experience that is simply compelling - it is impossible to listen to it and remain disengaged. A worthy addition to any collection, even if you have other recordings of this great work."
2,Logitech Cordless Vantage Headset for Playstation 3,"Gave it to my son for Chritmas. He is very satisfied with it. I have purchased less expensive headsets in the past, and this is the best one so far."
2,I always wanted to read more and could NOT put it down!,"If you enjoy romance books with lots of twists and turns, you will thoroughly enjoy this book! I was on vacation when I read this and just couldn't put it down (even though my vacation to Austria was very exciting!)!It is well written and actually taught me a lesson. I hope you consider this book and have a wonderful time reading it!"
2,Never disappoints,"Pimp C is back and does his thing on this album. I listened to the whole cd from beginning to the end and pimp c murders the beats. The only thing i didn't like was that there are a lot of guest appearances and pimp is sometimes overshadowed, but overall this is a great cd."
1,lousy clock ... doesn't work at all,"This Chaney radio controlled clock, which I bought from Amazon, is one year old and doesn't work at all. Actually, that's not true. The hands do move ... it just doesn't keep time at all. Nice looking but utterly useless. I strongly discourage anyone buying this clock; you will just be throwing your money out."
1,False Impressions,"You would think a book with a title ""How to learn golf"" would teach you something about how to play golf wouldn't you? Well not this one. Instead, it gives uninteresting statistics on golfers like how many people took up the game in 2000 or how many people quit the game (who cares!). Also the book tells of different ways to go about learning golf such as going to a pro or reading a book. As for myself, I chose reading a book, and unfortuanetly i chose this one. Don't buy this book!"
2,Good for a small space,"I just moved to a small city apartment and this vacuum is perfect! It has a lot of power, it is very compact and cleans great. The reason I gave it 4 out of five its because it feels a little flimsy, I guess you get what you pay for. Also, if you have a regular sized home you would hate it, unless you want to use it on the stairs or for quick touch ups. The opening is small and it is very simple, it does not contain any extra gadgets or hoses. But if you are living single, in a dorm or small apt. this vaccum is the way to go!"
1,Why bother?,"It looks dumb, I mean you just style the hair and stuff! And why waste your money on something your kid will give away eventually!"
1,Askew and unconstructable,"I got it halfway built before I realized two things:1. Upon turning it upside down, I learned that the keyboard bars aren't level, which would keep my keyboard from sitting nicely on top and would make it wobble everywhere. I think the cross bars are twisted a little.2. One of the base bars has no screw hole to assemble.Seems like other people have had this problem too. I'm sending it back and getting a different brand."
1,A huge disappointment,"After all the advertising hype about this movie, I was very excited to see it. But from the first scene to the last, it was laughable instead of being serious. The worst drivel in the movie was the speech by the president to the pilots near the end. The characters themselves were so underdeveloped that no one cared that they were about to perish. And give me a break - if the first lady was dying, doctors would do more for her than placing a little oxygen on her and saying ""there's nothing we can do."""
2,execellence,"This product is more than expected, thanks Amazon, now that I have a taste of how Niv application commentary is I want to get the whole collection. Book is new, informative, fast delivery and it is all that u expect a commentary (a useful) one to have."
1,"Not as pictured, at least half the size","Photo above has clearly been photo shopped. This product is simply not suitable for the children shown, as they would not all fit."
2,An appealing guide newcomers to raw cuisine will relish,"The authors are unlikely candidates for raw food promotion: both graduates of the French Culinary Institute, they savored New York's most sophisticated restaurants until a friend brought them to a small raw/vegan restaurant packed with flavor more than style. Kenney and Melngailis discovered a new world there - one which incorporated flavor into healthy eating styles - and their explorations of raw foods evolved into Manhattan's Pure Food and Wine restaurant, which elevated raw food to gourmet status. Raw Food/Real World: 100 Recipes To Get The Glow promotes this cuisine, from cold yet flavorful soups to wraps, pastas, and much more. Add numerous color photos and discussions of health and raw food concerns and you have an appealing guide newcomers to raw cuisine will relish."
1,buying this game my have a sideafect of YAWNNNNNNNN,"I MADE THE STUPID MISTAKE of buying this game and sure was i disapointed , the graphics were cool but the gameplay was a piece of crap!!o boy sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner ,so fun, NOT!!!!do not!! i repeat do NOT buy or even rent it .the whole 10 minutes in the beginning is just pro.e gadd goin blah blah blah.nintendo really messed up on this game ,they should be embarresed to put the great video game compenys name on such a horror.i love gamecube but thie first game was a TERROR!!!!!!"
2,Just what I needed,This was exactly as described on Amazon. It was the correct manufacturer and size at a good price. Works great!
1,Too much noise even at low volumes,"Very average quality speaker system. Too much noise even at low volumes. Even with highest recording quality files, the volume is horribly noisy."
2,Love it!,"I love scrubs. It is amazing,I cannot wait until season 6 comes out on dvd! It's such a cliff hanger!"
2,A quality fuel cap.,"This fuel cap is made by AC Delco, part of General Motors. And while it doesn't always match the pictured item- the one I got was red where the picture shows gray- it's well made and does its job properly. It is very specific, however, in what car it is for- I ordered it for a 1998 Chevrolet Prizm, and so far as I know that's the only car it fits. If it does fit your car, regardless, I highly recommend this fuel cap."
1,Absolutely terrible,"NIGHT, DAWN and MARTIN are classic films which will be cherished as long as there are sentient creatures around who enjoy films. DAY, LAND and SEASON are pretty damn good films, as well. This is even worse than KNIGHTRIDERS. A stupid idea, poorly done. Beware of any film with a morose, philosophical voice-over. This is obviously Granpa Romero's take on these darn kids with their new-fangled gadgets that gots 'em so plugged in them l'il varmints cain't tell the difference between reality and nonsense. The insights offered are about as deep as Bush's sympathy for the poor, the gore is pathetic and the premise and execution are hard to sit through. This features some of the dumbest, preachiest and most heavy-handed dialog of any film in recent memory. Let's hope the next one is better."
2,Forget Harry Porter,"This is one of the best children's book I've ever read. Most of the books written by the Scandinavian children's writers never make it to the US -- which is too bad. These books are very well-written they are not ""scary"" and have really sophisticated plots that make a child think."
2,A Whole New Mind,"The context of this book is spot on for parents nurturing developing young minds. We need to really move away from the old way of thinking (L-Directed thinking), and encourage the next generation to have an open approach to learning and leading. We need to grow the next generation of leaders and the suggestions in this book will give us a huge boost in doing that."
2,An amazing book!,"The charecters are wonderful, the girls act like real children do! The book is such a wonderful story even though I'm not Jewish, I enjoyed learning about their holidays."
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this thinking it would be much much better than your average instant ramen noodle. This was expensive! VERY expensive for what it is and it is not worth even half what I paid, I'm serious when I say this: all you're paying for is some fancy schmancy ""green packaging"" what's inside it's even worst than any 5 for a dollar maruchan. If you're looking for something similar to this the Maruchan yakisobaMaruchan Yakisoba, Teriyaki Beef Flavor, 4-Ounce Microwavable Containers (Pack of 8)is nothing fancy but it's WAAAYY better than this. BIG waste of money :("
1,Fool me thrice... only a fool would order this.,The extended editions are being released in November for the Xmas rush. This is a mid-year rip-off that should not be entertained. And they wonder why their products are pirated.....
1,visual disaster made in France,"if the french could simply refrain from laying their hands on Teutonic arts, they would have made contributions to the civilization, and everyone would have thanked them...but as in this case, they totally ruined wagner's die walkure by some of the stupidest stage arrangements. the singing is so so, but the stage setting is unpleasant visually,not to mention some of the singers sweated like pigs, ehhwww... that's french's sophisticated wagner interpretation... and my $50 down the toilet."
2,A Star is Born?,"As should be obvious to anyone who spent the summer watching ""American Idol"", this girl can sing. Neither of these songs are great examples of songwriting craft (they're both functional but not much more than that) but Kelly manages to breathe life into both of them. ""Before Your Love"", which seemed the weaker of the two on the live show, shines here in a taut, tasty arrangement. ""A Moment Like This"", on the other hand, is fine here but seems just a bit less affecting than it did when she sang it on the show."
1,False warranty Information,"Not a negative review of the item.Amazon is advertising false warranty claims on this item. They claim it has a life time warranty, when in fact it is only 1 year. Do not purchase this item expecting extended support or replacement as advertised. Amazon does not seem to think that selling items under false pretenses is a big deal.As far as the hub is concerned it seems to be a quality hub. Hopefully it lasts longer than the last two powered hubs I had that just stopped working. Customer service at Amazon is a all time low as of late."
2,Tastes like real bread and very fluffy!,"Great bread mix, easy to use without the bread machine. I prefer the ""french"" bread version, but this one is great too!"
2,My Toddler (and his mommy) loves this CD!,"This CD is full of charming lively ditties and slower ballads. Some of them are written by the singer and others are classic children's songs. I must confess that I like Laurie Berkner's songs better! My 20-month old son cannot get enough of this CD, asking for it to be played several times during the day. It is a good thing that many of her songs are written to have some appeal for grown-ups. For example, her song ""Doodlebugs"" has characters named after the ""Seinfeld"" crew -- the song is danceable for kids, but funny for us mommies (and daddies) too. The CD comes with lyrics included and the singer has also added movement suggestions for the songs which make using it during playtime even easier. It took Amazon several weeks to track this CD down for me, but it has been well worth the wait!"
1,No big deal.,My picture bracket fell down so I tried this stuff. I waited the recommended time then put my breakfast tray up. It fell down right away.
1,To Kill a Mockingbird,The copy I received was filled with hand written notes throughout the text. I was very disappointed in this purchase.
1,Don't buy it,"This game sucks. It's the 5th boxing style game i have. I played it for 2 minutes popped it out and sold it right back. its slow reaction. you get punched while your trying to dodge, 3 senconds after you hit dodge, he barely gets out of the way. the graphics suck. i dont know what everyone else see's. I love the Rocky movies and i love boxing games. This one blows."
2,Marvel gets some Clix,"The set that started heroclix! This set has everything you need to play, characters, maps, tokens, dice, and even the early bystanders."
2,Relationship Strategies: The E & P Attraction,"It sounds cheesy but it's true, this book changed my life 15 years ago. I was so frustrated with relationships when I found this book. I'd just gotten out of a long relationship that I thought was perfect but clearly was not. This book not only explained to me why that relationship failed but it showed me what to look for in the next one. And it was right! I've been using what this book taught me for over 15 years now. I've recommended this book to so many people. The cover is cheesy. It looks like a bad romance novel. However this is definitely one of those cases where you don't want to judge a book by its cover. If you want to understand what to be looking for in your next partner, or how to make your current relationship work, read this book."
2,Changed my mind along the way,"I had actually not watched the miniseries before I caught the first episode (via Internet), but when I saw :33 I knew I instantly liked the series. Then after catching up with the miniseries to get the background, I couldn't wait until I was able to obtain the remaining episodes one by one.I was originally of the camp of not messing with the original BSG (Starbuck a woman?, Tigh a drunk?, Boomer a Cylon?), so I boycotted the miniseries. Well, it's much better TV than most rewrites - thinking along the lines of what they did to Mission Impossible-Tom Cruise's version (yuck) and how I hate that."
1,Did not work,"Would not work at all on one TV. Told me no signal. On another TV the Wii screen would flash on and off, but would not achieve a reliable signal. Wound up buying a more expense cable from Nyko that works fine."
1,I didn't got this product,I need my money back... because until now I didn't got this product... I waiting so long time to got this product
1,A mediocre mystery,"Now here's a mystery with every contemporary cliche imaginable:it's a mystery, with a woman detective, who owns a bed-and-breakfast,likes to cook and has a catering business, is married to a cop,and lives in suburbia. Any ONE of these overworked fads ofcontemporary popular mystery novels would have worked, but all of themtogether--is, well, breathtaking. And there's not much that saves it,either: the plot line is bogged down by all the trickery thatthe author needs in order to weave all the cliches into thebook, and Dalheim's prose is strictly second rate. The best momentsin it belong to the crusty mother of the heroine, a nasty witch who saysexactly what's on her mind, directly and without artifice. Perhaps Daheimwould benefit from a lesson offered by one of her own characters....."
2,Good in Cold Weather,"I work at a local (PA) ski area in the race department. I wear these all the time. Skiing, setting race courses, setting nets and fence. They work fine and hold up to the WORK load as well as keep my hands warm. Sure beats paying for brand name ski gloves that fall way short, considering the price they charge."
1,a disGRACE,There is only one Rear Window and that is Hitchcock's 1954 version with Grace Kelly and the irreplacable Jimmy Stewart. Why remake a flawless classic? Reeve and Hannah aren't even in the same league as Kelly & Stewart.Senseless in my opinion.
2,Awesome!,I bought this for my 22 month old daughter who is a huge Dora fan. She love to wear it and put her Dora books in it. She takes it to the babysitters house and it is a huge hit with all the kids.
2,Great Book!,"I believe ""Like Water for Chocolate"" Is one of the best books that I have read. Every time I read this book it gets better and better."
1,i only read it because it was for school,"This book was terrible. I have not read the Book Thief or whatever by this author. This story had a stupid plot that even if you did like a little was totally ruined by the crappy, unrealistic ending. The main character, Ed, kept changing his personality through the book and being a stupid little whiner. The plot was so stupid! I hated it! I didn't even see how Ed was a messenger at all. I am so mad I got assigned this for my summer book and will have to discuss it for the first week of school. All that crap about feeling the hearts and then there were stalkers videotaping Ed and knowing exactly what he would do and breaking into his apartment! Do not read it if you like books to make sense!"
2,If you like the movie you'll like the album.,"Great music from the movie. My only complaint is it's literally pulled from the movie, so it's a little weird to listen to it while not watching the movie, the singing dialog from the movie. Jennifer Hudson is the highlight throughout the album."
1,Eh...,"I didn't really like this movie at all. On paper, the idea is great, they just failed to pull it off. I really wanted to like it, since I liked the first two Alien movies and the first Predator movie, but I just couldn't. I didn't feel any suspense at all throughout the whole film, I didn't care about any of the characters save for maybe one, and the plot was kinda confusing. I wouldn't recommend it... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Very hard to understand,"We used this book in our Introduction to Probability course at Georgia Tech. This book is written in a not-so-easy to understand matter and is good for someone that has a strong background in math. A few of my friends doing their Ph.D were helping me with this course and they also found this book hard to understand as well. If you read the text you're still gonna have such a hard time doing the exercises because it doesn't explain everything smoothly. I searched through the internet to find a solution manual for this book and simply they don't have it. You only get the solution if you get the teacher version. The book is written and published in Netherlands and it doesn't have any online resource for students. If you have to buy this book for your class make sure you get ""Schaum's Outline of Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes"" or a similar book for extra help, otherwise you'll regret like I do."
1,I would give this 0 stars.,"I cannot even finish this book. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I am so glad I got it from the library and did not pay for it. I would throw it in the trash and I love books. How are you supposed to read a romance about a ""hero"" that is continually raping the heroine. Then everyone around her acts like it is no big deal and she should be happy about it because he is hansome. This book is discusting. I don't care if it gets better because I just can't take it anymore. It has been years since I didn't finish a book but I cannot read one more line of this book."
1,Worst coffee machine ever,"I can't even emphasize how unhappy I am with this coffee machine. I bought it because I really like Cusinart products, and I thought it was a very nice looking coffee pot, and I wanted a 4 cup machine, but I just hate it. You have to pour over the sink or else it spills everywhere, no matter how slowly or carefully you pour. Also, if you forget to dump out left over coffee (which is easy to forget since you can't see the contents) in just a couple days, literally, it molds. I don't even understand how it can get so moldy so quickly. Even if I do dump out the coffee, unless I actually wash the carafe very thoroughly, there will be little bits of mold all over the interior after a few days. And most importantly, the coffee tastes horrible. Horrible. I'm not even a picky coffee drinker.I really want to like this coffee pot because it's so nice looking, but I'm just so completely dissatisfied."
1,not as advertise,it claims to be 3 inches x 5 inches x 6 inches it is cm not inches i thought i was expexting this mid size box and it got this small box
1,"Fun toy, poorly made",I had great fun with this toy playing at a store I spotted it in. The problem is the toy is poorly designed and will fail over time. There are 2 main problems.1. The rim at the back of the airzooka which holds the plastic cover in place is poorly designed. It has very shallow groves which hold it in place. If you drop it the rim will pop out from its moorings and the plastic will potentially come undone.2. The plastic backing is poorly made because it is stitched back on itself. This creates tiny perforations which will get bigger over time. My airzooka had gaping holes the size of a thumbnail in two spots after 20 'shots. Once the perforations enlarge the airzooka simply fails to shoot a significant amount of air.
2,Great Product,"This product works great. I haven't had them for long, but I have used them twice already. My bras actually fit(I'm a D), which is a step above the other, similar products. After washing and drying, they came out in perfect condition: clean, undamaged, and with no folds. I also used them when traveling, to help my bras maintain thier shape. I can place two of them in each cube, and know that they will be in great shape when I get to my destination.The one negative aspect is that I can tell that the zipper on one of the cubes is going to break soon. It is very tight and barely moves, and I just know that one of the next few times I try to use it its going to come right off.I would definately reccomend this product. The zipper may be trouble, but for how inexpensive the product is and for how well it works, I would take the risk again."
2,Better than crayons and MUCH more durable,"Purchased these as an alternative to my kids breaking crayons all the time. Went on other reviewers who gave glowing reviews of them. They're pretty much right - these are great. Made of real wood and the pencils are a combination btwn crayons and pencils. Don't break, rarely break a tip. I liked these so much I actually purchased them for my daughters best friend as part of her birthday gift. Will buy again... just wish there were more colors."
2,Rain Man,"The book holds up well and is as enjoyable as the movie. I personally found it to be more interesting than it's big screen counterpart and highly recommend it. Also, the reader learns more about Tom Cruises Character Charlie Babbit, who really is the main character."
2,Truly a Classic & Benchmark,"MOO2 is a classic and benchmark by which all space opera (strategy) games should be measured. This game got pretty much everything right in terms of story, gameplay, and strategy. Many games have tried to immitate MOO2, with very few coming close to this classic game. Even though its came out a few years ago and looks a dated, the gameplay is really good."
2,"After Sept. 11th, this is a must-read","Auerbach's brilliant and prescient book shows us how terrorists-including Osama bin Laden-have been financing their operations all these years: kidnapping innocent tourists and businessmen in a now too-famous part of world. Auerbach's writing is wonderful; the book reads like a thriller. Her reporting is the best of journalism, sensitive and informative. She gets behind the scenes of the private kidnap consultants and the U.S. government that, for complicated political reasons, failed to protect and save Americans in that troubled region. And her message is very important. Your safety is your own reponsibility. No one may be able to warn you more specifically about these terrorists' intent or come to your rescue if you fall into their hands. Auerbach was ahead of her time. But now we all know how right she is. Read the book for your own protection. The kidnap problem is ongoing--and getting worse."
2,Better than Harry Potter!!,This book is second only to the Magicians of Caprona also by Diana Wynne Jones. The book is an awasome journey of childrens discovery of themselves and their place in the world. Better than than the Harry Potter series by a long shot!!!
2,Gets the job done,"The material is not as high quality as Apple's chargers, but frankly, $0.46??? Who cares? It gets the job done! My iPod Classic didn't burn or explode or did anything dramatic, as some reviewers hinted it might happen - it just charged normally. Great purchase for such little money."
1,Mr. Blue Colar Independent O'Reilly,"I used to watch O'Reilly last year. Suddenly he became the ""independent"", on the fence, blue colar guy. He only thinks of getting more audience by riding the fence. Shame on him!I gave the book to my husband --who is a fan of O'Reilly-- and he could not pass the 1st chapter! O'Reilly seems to loath people who are upper class. Someone would like to buy the book? Anyone? Please..."
2,"Enlightening and intriguing, highly recommended","What is it that distinguishes humans from the rest of animal kingdom? Why can only humans communicate through auditory and written symbols that can be recombined into virtually infinite meanings, hypothesize what the future may bring, or imagine the unknown? The Human Spark with Alan Alda explores the differences between modern homo sapiens, our extinct Neanderthal cousins, and modern-day chimpanzees. An extraordinary documentary about what modern-day science has to say about the quintessential distinguishing features of humanity, The Human Spark with Alan Alda is enlightening and intriguing, highly recommended especially for public library collections. 3 hours, widescreen, closed captioned."
1,"The VHS file has been transfered to DVD, can't watch quality to poor","The film......LegendaryNow the release;All that the studio have done is to take the VHS movie file and transfer that low resolution Image and Audio onto a DVD. My advice is to wait for the bluray, the dvd is a waste of money and is no upgrade what-so-ever to the VHS release."
1,What a rip-off,"These films were supposed to have been remastered... you could have fooled me !! BAD in all respects. The only reason that I don't dump the DVD is because it's the only one available of ""Rainbow on the River"" If you expect a REMASTERED item don't bother, you will be grossly disappointed."
1,I despise this product.,this has to be one of the worst products gillette has ever put on the market. it simply doesn't work. the shaving cream bars extend so far past the blades that the blades don't even come near enough to my legs to remove any hair. i seriously can't say that this razor doesn't work well--it doesn't work at all. i'm surprised it's still on the market.
1,Only made it to page 90,"I wanted very much to like this book. A book about an English teacher's students loving books-- a dream for another English teacher! The problem for me was that Nafisi's characters blend into one another and just don't seem like real people at all. Considering the fact that these are real people, people Nafisi knew quite well, you'd think she'd be able to make them more real for the reader. At first, I thought that was her intention, to show how faceless women are in that society, but that later she would reveal their characters through their discovery and discussion of the books. Not so. Well, not at least until page 90, when I could bear no more."
1,very dissatisfied,The zipper on the back pack is broken already. My son is in kindergarten and he carries one small notebook to school in it. I noticed it had a tear in it the other day and now the zipper is just gone. He has only used it about 4 or 5 times.
1,Bad Product - Questionable Company,"Sandisk MMC cards may work with some devices but they do not work with the Intel personal audio 3000 period. This is in other reviews and I AGREE TOTALLY with them. The problem is that while the card is recognized, you can only put 1 mp3 file on the card. If you copy another it will put two copies of itself and get rid of the previous one! This is hard to believe but very true. I used Intel transfer software, Musicmatch transfer software and Media player transfer - all three methods got the same result. I called Intel and they said there was a know problem and gave me the Sandisk number. The first call to Sandisk resulted in them telling me they knew of no problem - I protested and they escalated and said they would call me. I called again today - they admitted it was a problem but had no solution. Shame on Amazon for selling me this combo. Shame on Sandisk for not being honest on the first call."
2,"Savage Garden's ""I Knew I Loved You""","I love this CD! I especially like the acoustic version. The song is so pure, beautiful, and romantic. I simply fell in love with it the 1st time I heard it. Buy it!"
1,Awful,"If you loved Best Busypeople, Best Learning Songs, Best Counting, Best ABC, & Best Mother Goose, you will hate this as much as I my son and I did. Terrible sound quality, a story that takes place 1,000 years ago in Bohemia with accents so thick you cannot understand what the characters are saying. The other two stories are strange; one is about the ""reality"" of the Easter Bunny (those that would enjoy this would not even entertain the thought) and the final story finds Huckle taking care of a family of lost baby birds. He sneaks them into his room and lies to his parents when they walk in after hearing the birds! Each story is broken up by what are called ""music interstitials"" aka music videos featuring Huckle and the gang either rapping or rocking out to heavy metal. It is truly unbelievable - and sickening - to watch. This, along with the other Cinar/ Polygram Videos (which I think were produced after Richard Scarry's death in 1994)are not worth the bother, and are more than disappointing."
1,This felt so contrived,"Reading this book felt a little too forced. The characters are drawn so purposefully, with such radically differing personalities that it all felt like a ploy, a desperate attempt to create something meaningful that just didn't work. You can see the secrets a mile away, and they don't really have any effect when the resolution is thrust upon the reader. Each of these women is such a charicature that I had a hard time believing she could be for real -- the business with the hair was really a bit much for me.All in all, not that great a read. I wouldn't recommend the time investment -- it's just not worth it."
1,1600 For Men Total Body Powder,"Smells good, but it's too clumpy. It will not sprinkle out the small holes, I have to dump a pile in my hand and go from there."
2,Great Sci-Fi/Great Drama,Up to date material relevant with todays issues. The only two shows we follow with anticipation are Battlestar G and Lost. If you need to watch realality shows you are missing out on good creative artistic talent. Check it out!
2,"Works great, low price","Microsoft Lifecam 1000 works great, it does rest steady and solidly on my Dell Ultrasharp 19"" flat display. The video quality is good for a basic model. Enjoy."
2,Home for Christmas,"This movie took me by surprise. I thought, how can this be ok? Once I got into the movie, and began watching, I was hooked. We know how we want it to end, and finally it does!"
1,Developed A Leak,"I originally bought the .75 liter Camelbak because one of my friends had one and raved about it. I was also drawn to the vibrant color choices. At first this water bottle worked well for my indoor rock climbing sessions and lifting work-outs. I was disappointed to discover that the bottle was too big for standard water bottle holders on cardio machines (stair steppers and stationary bikes). After about 6 months of occasional use (3-5 times a week), the bottle developed a major leak on the lid and had to be tossed. I will not be replacing it with another Camelbak. As a loyal Nalgene user, I know there are better water bottles on the market."
2,Life and Living,"This is the story of one woman's life. That is, in all simplicity, what it is. It is life, albeit a well told, thought-provoking recitation. And unlike I have, Kingston does not go overboard on the vocabulary. The narrative is eloquent. I have found (uh-oh first person) it to be a good book and would recommend it even to my closest of friends. (Just so you know that I'm not just saying that, I'd recommend it to mes amis as well.) Oh, and just to show you that I really did read it, my favorite quote in the whole book goes a little along the lines of this: ""I learned to make my mind large, as the universe is large, so that there is room for paradoxes""(29). It is strange to learn that someone else has wondered why their last toe nail is split in half, and searched for a personal guru. Geez Louise, I've just about broken every rule in the English book. This is gonna be out in the public forum too. Ah well. I'll sum up now. Story of life, Well told."
1,J. Edgar (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy),I want this movie but will wait to buy it used; I refuse to surport UtrViolet Digital Copy in any way. This is not a movie review but a product review.
2,Great,"Our company has just embraced the UML process. We develop primarily in VB and this is the first book yet that seems to address VB and UML together in real-world situations. Wrox has a winner here, again. The best part of this book is that you get more than just the UML structure. The sample application uses RDS, MTS, ADO and other important distributed computing technologies. And best yet, you receive a structured approach (through UML) to understanding the problem at hand. Buy this book if you're serious about developing OO apps with VB."
2,Brew Pot,"Bought this pot for homebrewing in hind sight I should have gotten a bigger pot. The quality of the pot is good but it's a little thin, I burned lines in the bottom of it with my burner but I will still use it with no problem."
2,Yummy!,"I have tried other protein supplements but this one tastes really good (I have tried both vanilla and chocolate - I still need to try the strawberry and orange) and I like that its made with Stevia, and contains no artificial colors/flavors. I prefer to mix it with almond milk/Greek yogurt; and add in flax seed, coconut oil, cinnamon, and berries/bananas for an extra boost."
1,Poor quality,"Length:: 2:33 MinsThis is a video of my unboxing of the dehumidifier and I was very unhappy with what I saw. It is running okay so far, but wonder if the rest of the machine has the same poor quality. I will not be buying any other Haier products."
2,Sweet sweet sound,"I just bought these speakers today. They ROCK! Great sound. Also, as a ham radio operator, the RF shielding is an important factor for me. Cheap PC speakers will buzz very loudly when you key up a radio near them. These don't pick up any RF interference at all. The more I listen to these the more impressed I get."
2,Organic triumph,"This is a daring and exciting album that explores all the possiblities of the organ - reed combo. Mr Speed on tenor and clarinet and his companions eschew rehashing funk. Instead, they take off on the flight patterns blazed by innovators like Larry Young with Emergency and Sun Ra. Defintely a different organic experience."
2,"Excellent book for social skills, confidence, self esteem","This is an excellent book which helps you to go from just being friends to escalating the relationship to the point where either 1) you date her or 2) she's not interested and you focus your efforts elsewhere.I am someone who's comfortable talking to women but needed help getting to the next step.The book only gets four stars because he suggests meeting (trying to pick up women) in places like malls and supermarkets. Much better to meet women where you see each other again (through friends, work, school, volunteer organizations, etc.)"
1,This is NOT the 2nd Edition.,"I purchased this for a course I'm taking. I looked up the title and read that it was the 2nd edition. So, I ordered the Kindle edition which didn't list an edition number. I assumed it was the most recent because it was linked to the 2nd edition of the paperback version. The Kindle version IS NOT the 2nd edition. Now I've wasted almost $50 on a Kindle version I can't use and I have to buy the paperback edition that won't arrive for another week. Very poor Amazon. I'm Very Disappointed."
1,wrong,"Part I received was not wwhat I ordered, not even close to what is pictured. The part I received was a terminal block."
1,screwed,terrible camera which cost me plenty because i had to pay postage to return the thing. totally screwed. thanks for asking.
1,"Hardcore Fans, beware","I originally intended to purchase this book along with the two others that came out on the same subject. The West Wing is my favorite show, and I consider myself a very hardcore fan, one who can quote long phrases and cite details, if awoken in the middle of the night. This book has more errors in it than a 7-year-old's essay, and I felt I'd be better off never turning my eyes its way. It's just upsetting how little the author paid attention to what's going on in the show."
1,This book greatly motivates me,"1.To dig deep in the Bible to develop a GENUINE life in Christ.2.To find a new church, one that digs deeply into the Bible rather than 40 Days of this stuff."
2,Excelent camera but with few issues,"I have this camera for couple of weeks now and have taken more than 100 pictures. It is an excellent camera, though I have not taken prints yet, but I have seen pictures on TV & computer. Takes excelent movie. Whatever people are saying in the praise are 100% correct. So Why 4 stars??? There are few issues that I have encountered so far, which may not be of any importance to you, but are to me:1. It does not imprint Date on the picture. You can get the date printed on the prints, but that is possible through Canon's ZoomBrowser EX program. which means you need to buy a photo printer also.2. When viewing picture, you can zoom into the picture, but can not take a snapshot of any region. You can do this using any software, but that is an extra headache.I have seen Sony's DSC-P9, and it does both and is also an excellent camera."
1,Got what I paid for,"The price was too good to be true. Although the size of the diamonds is accurate, they lack sparkle. My CZ's are prettier. Fortunately, these were for my 17 year old daughter. I didn't to spend a great deal in case she lost one. I wouldn't recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale."
1,JUNK...JUNK ... JUNK,"I've tried 2 different remote starters by Bulldog Security. To me they were easy to install with the ""T"" harness. But they just don't work worth a darn. One of mine had a stated range of over 1,000 feet. It would not work more than 10 feet fom the car. It would not start the car in the driveway while I was standing at the back door of my house or while standing at a window about 30 feet from the car. And it was supposed to have a range of 1,000 feet ? Yeah right ! And like almost everyone says, it's like going through hell and high water to ever get a live person on the phone. And then they act like they don't give a rat's a_ _. They are definitely not customer oriented. Very inferior product and company. I will never think about purchasing one of their products again. STAY AWAY from these people and their products ! I gave it only one star because I had to give it a rating to post. It actually does not deserve even one star."
2,7th Heaven,My daughter has collected this whole series. She can't wait for season 11 to come out. The whole family really enjoys watching this time and time again.
2,An absolute must for parents!!!!!,"An excellent book. Jim Fay and Foster Cline add humor to a very difficult and trying experience for all parents. Not only is the humorous quality of this book beneficial, but the principals follow the best logical way to raise children. My wife and I have tried these principles with our own children and they work like a charm. As they say in the book....Parenting can be fun. This is an excellent book and I like to purchase it for baby showers and christmas gifts."
2,Great for a bible study or Torah discussion,This book is worth your time if you are interested in the missing details of famous biblical stories. Some are similar to the accounts of Josephus and Rabbinic commentaries which reinforces the claim to its origins in Antiquity. There are some numerical inaccuracies that the translator missed noting and a few embelliousments to stories that sound as if they were later additions but on the whole it is a jewel.
1,Torture Device for Dogs?,This looks like some kind of torture device for dogs. I'm saddened that people who claim to love their dogs would put something like this on them. I'm equally saddened that a reputable website like Amazon would even sell such a thing.
2,Unique Band,"My wife spun this CD when we were traveling recently via car, and I really liked it. The Chili Peppers have a sound all their own, for the most part; it's hard to classify it at times. I of course recognized many of the popular songs, but was introduced to some others that were equally as good. My personal favorite is BREAKING THE GIRL, which sounds a lot like XTC from the early 80's. Even the vocals sound like Andy Partridge from XTC. For those who want to get to know this group, I recommend this CD. It's consistently entertaining from beginning to end. 8/10"
2,Highly recommended,I love this movie. Every family should have it. It makes you want to be a better person. I highly recommend it to everyone.Kirsten(...)
1,Frustrated in San Diego,"I ordered a Big Ben alarm clock for my daughter for Christmas, in the beginning of Dec. When it arrived, the hands hadn't even been installed on the face. I called and asked for a new one to be rushed to me. I was told it went out that same day. A week later I followed up on the order and they had forgotten to place the second order. I'm now waiting on a third shipment to arrive. My credit card was charged the day after I placed the order. I wish my product had been handled as expeditiously. I will not do business with them again. This was a very frustrating experience."
1,ways ton waste $...,"The concept for this game had me intrigued, however once I installed it all I can say is ....simple. There are so many possibilities in this concept that just don't pan out or simply wern't explored. For instance I can't change the color or name the car types. Also for some reason dealerships won't change the types of cars they sell. What can I say but the game lasted less then a week and now its a fairly good frisbee!"
2,Good fan,"Ok so this fan has 3 settings, I have it constantly running on it's highest (loudest) setting and I can't hear it at all. I sit about 2 feet away from my computer so it's not that I'm far away from it. I'm currently using it as a side fan but I'm planning on getting two more to replace my existing fans.It runs very smooth, has more than decent airflow, keeps all my components cool enough and was extremely easy to install. The price is also really good. I guess the only bad thing is, it wasn't free?I would definitely recommend this product to a friend but not to a foe if you catch my drift."
2,Your Mission if You choose to Accept It,"Tom Cruise's third (and his last) Mission is an action thriller that works on so many levels. It works since J.J. Abrahams directed this like man version of Alias. It works as part of the Mission Impossible film trilogy< It works as a taut action adventure thriller. It works as a vehicle for Tom Cruise.It is not your father's Mission Impossible...it starts at a point towards the end and works back. The amazing thing you are drawn into this complex piece. The puzzle that this movie is sometimes gets overwhemingthere are a few missteps in the action and the ploting, However Cruise and compant shines in this twist and turn script with so many red herings.I will say Phillip Seymore Hoffman is a calm bad guy which works against Cruise's hot and cold action man. Ving Rhames is so under used in MI3. Michelle Monaghan is a star who shined as Cruise's love interest.it is a good action flick for those who crave actionBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"
2,Great conditioner!,"I haven't been able to find this product in the store for over a year now; I believe that Dove no longer makes it. I think it is wonderful. I get compliments on how shiny my hair looks when I use it. The convenience of the in shower dispenser is also great. Less breakage and a silky feel to hair, love this product."
1,Very Disturbing,I found this movie very disturbing. I enjoy horror movies but this was very hard to watch. In it there is a camper scene where a young girl gets raped and while all that is taking place a baby is crying all through the scene. 2 things I hate to see in a movie and can't understand why directors feel to put it in. It was more sad than enjoyable. Not for anyone under 18.
1,"Lots of Disk Space, But make sure you have 2 for back up","Hopefully they will invent Flash drives that have large amounts of spacebecause Hard Disk are not trust worthy, as I have learned from my own expirience. So if you buy this, buy 2 of them. One as your main and one as your back up. They are just to fragile. Overall its not a bad product and will et you by for a while till the fash drives with 500GB make thier apperance!"
1,Copy Protection,"This disc gets one star because it's defective. It's got copy protection on it and is therefor not actually a Compact Disc, though Amazon seems to be giving the impression that it is. Take a look at the packaging; nowhere will you find a CD logo. Sorry Closure. Apparently you guys rock, so I thought I try it out, but I'm done with you now. On to the next band who rocks and knows how to release ACTUAL CDs."
2,great party song,"I brought this cd to use at a party after I saw the dance demonstration on ABC - The View. The song is festive and everyone at the party liked it. The song has a combination of music and vocals, which is what I like. I think the pizza dance is a fun pop cd. It's great, just like pizza! I like to hear other songs by this artist."
2,Disk change was because. . .,"of the poor quality of the DVD 18s, those notoriously horrid double sided pieces of crap. There have been tons of problems concerning damage to these double sided disks, specifically the Farscape Starburst Editions and the show American Gothic. The change was welcome, simply because I had received one of those screwed up disks, and I would have liked it if they had not been damaged. If your disk is damaged, return it or buff it. Unfortunately, when the 18s get damaged bad enough, they are useless, and they are damaged VERY easily."
2,A magnificent calculus book,"This book is computationally obsolete (the first edition was written before the advent of computer algebra systems like Mathematica, Maple and Matlab, thus is based on Fortran) but it stands head and shoulders above all recent and not-so-recent calculus books; to find its peers, one would have to go back to classics such as Courant's Differential and Integral Calculus.The choice of topics is impeccable (and very different from most calculus books). Applications and numerics are never out of sight (not a surprise given Lax's standing as an applied mathematician).It is sad comment on the teaching of calculus in this country that this book is out of print; it (or its updated editions) should be in use everywhere."
1,I was not impressed with Peach Girl at all...,"This is one of the most beautifully done manga I've seen, but that is all it has going for it in my eyes. The characters are shallow and superficial. The plot is unoriginal, and I felt as though I wanted to slit my wrists after reading some of the episodes. Not for those who feel for another person."
1,Not original versions,From the CD label: This album contains some tracks that are re-recorded. All single artist tracks are performed by the original artist. Tracks featuring groups were recorded using as many of the original group members as possible.I suggest you look elsewhere for these songs.
1,Fun While It Lasted,"Bought this in November as a Christmas present for my 11 year old, so it was opened on Dec. 25. On July 4 (6 months and 9 days later), the CD player failed to detect that a disk was installed. It didn't take long to see that the laser lens inside the player was missing... it had popped out. I found it loose inside the bottom of the speaker case. I could not reinstall it, and it appears that the retention of that lens is simple friction against some side posts. Or possibly, another retention piece is missing and I can't find it. Compared to another brand CD player, the lens mounting is cheap, lightweight, and probably built by the lowest biding subcontractor for Phillips. In any case, it couldn't hold up to an 11 year old playing it outside with friends. So, if you are bedridden or similarly isolated such that this boom box will sit on a sturdy table and not be moved much, this is the unit for you. I gave it 2 stars instead of of only one because it does sound good when it plays."
1,Dull,I recommend that you not waste your time. I have found that the quality of Niven's writing has diminished greatly in recent years. The ideas for this book should have been turned over to Robert Silverberg. He would have made an entertaining story out of.
2,The First Iron lady?,"This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings, (she was renowned at the time for her short temper), both as a woman and a Queen.The glamour of the Tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life.Elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings, her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man's world. Elizabeth was nobody's fool and although she would listen to her advisers, she had a mind of her own, shrewd and extremely intelligent, and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself.The book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history."
2,Great date night movie!,"Lots of great parts to this movie, it's funny and sweet. I wish they made more movies like this, that are sweet and fun to watch without alot of extra junk in them."
2,Quality for a change,"This toaster is not one of the cheap, lightweight, worthless toasters routinely sold for $19.99 or less. The ones you can expect to throw out in a year or less. It is substantial and attractive with some nice features. I especially like the extra boost for shorter pieces of bread or English muffins, which is accomplished by pulling up on the toasting lever. It does seem to take longer than some toasters to toast the bread, but overall does a fine job. The color is nice, too."
1,They chopped down trees for this?,"Frankly let's face it. If Clinton was Republican this book would not have been written. If it is 'morality' that Bennett is concerned with why doesn't he investigate the moral conduct of the likes of Gingrich and Mr Hyde - to start with. If the President is to set good moral example, so too do other senior politicians - no more and no less."
1,Bridgmans Books,"I bought 3 of Bridgmans books: Life Drawing, Constructive Anatomy and Heads, Features and Faces after reading the reviews. No one mentioned that most of the pages are dedicated to the anatomy of men, however I am interested in the female anatomy, so, these books did not work for me."
1,My Pitch against this book.,"Many sports fans end up basing their world so completely around their chosen sport that it ends up eclipsing everything else in their lives. Everything and everyone in their life suffers and the sport becomes a addiction. Nick Hornby is addicted to football and describes this humorously through showing his remarkable memory for facts and witty recollections of many moments gone foggy in the minds of other soccer fans. Unfortunately its just not very interesting after fifty pages, to hear of the authors anguish over Arsenal crashing out of the Rumbelows cup in the second round, again. His writing has about as much descriptive power as that of the New York Post or Boston Herald and our sympathies for his character and the other walk-on parts in his obsessed life barely register. Not litreature, not clever not for everyone."
2,Would you rather...,"This is a book of choices - choices that are not always so wonderful. Even so, the choosing is fun. Young children can learn about selecting the ""lesser of two (or three or four) evils."" When used with a group of readers, the idea of consensus can be examined."
2,Judy45,I just love this series. It is just good and fun family entertainment. Angela Lansbury IS Jessica Fletcher! The casting is wonderful. Great actors who we hadn't seen in awhile.
2,Great ingredient for almost-casserole,"Annie's pastas are tasty on their own, but even tastier when you find ""the right stuff"" to add to them. The shells and white cheddar can be turned into a super-fast almost-casserole by adding these quick items:* canned tuna, heated in a frying pan with your favorite oil, a little Worcestershire sauce, and your favorite general-purpose spices (I vary these, but garlic powder, parsley, and a dash of black pepper work nicely)* peas* use a little extra milk when you add the tunaAll these items can be cooked and combined in less than half an hour, and the result tastes much like a tuna noodle casserole with white cheddar. Very tasty, with hardly any effort!"
2,Wished I had read this book a long time ago,"This book was written for guys on how to spot and avoid selfish and manipulative women aka ""dirty sisters."" Let's face it. We men have been sold a bill of goods by the media and magazines that play on our need to have sex and find a lasting relationship. What they don't give you is a guide on how to find Ms. Right while avoiding Ms. Wrong. This book is that guide.Contents include a list of the seven types of women, what their motives are, and how to avoid them. It even gives some celebrity examples for each type. However, I had one gripe: there weren't enough celebrity examples, but I guess that's just the gossip in me."
1,Give me a break!,"This book was so silly. A woman, married 20 some years, and a monk 'fall in love' after talking to each other for about 2 minutes.I was bored to death and at the same time annoyed by these insipid characters."
2,Rockin' Mission from the Mackster,"This is one of the best soundtracks I've heard since The Matrix. This is clearly Hans Zimmer's best work, especially with the kick-ass(pardon my french) guitar work in track ""Bare Island"" and Mission:Impossible 2 theme as well as track 12. Well I have my ""date"" with Nyah, she just broke up with that dork,Ethan. Can't be late, she likes to be on top. This review will self-destruct in 5 seconds."
1,not as pictured,The Item I received has the female end in the middle rather then on and end so I am now going to need a 90 degree elbow to make this work.
2,Favorite sitcom,Now i would have rated this product 5 stars however my second disk in season 2 WAS BROKEN. Tho the series deserves five stars the product doesn't however its a very nice layout.
2,"Not mind blowing, but well worth the price","This game is pure fun, lacking any substance or depth whatsoever.But that's ok--that's all it's meant to be! And the designers succeeded. This game is a good way to veg out after a long weekday or a good way to spend a Saturday morning. There are no puzzles to solve and although there are some tricky tracks, there are no frustratingly difficult battles.The graphics are very good, and do a great job of immersing you in the environments. Gameplay is good.Overall, 4.5 out of 5"
1,Sex in the City-Movie,I love the movie but I didn't get what I ordered. I specifically ordered the special edition of the movie but got the regular one. Disappointing!!!
1,CD Player stopped working,"I loved this thing until about 3 months after we bought it and the CD player stopped working. We didnt buy the extended warrenty so we were SOL. we went about a year with it and all of a sudden the CD player started working again...but not for long. After another 3-4 months, it quit on us again. The sound is/was great, and it was very easy to use and loved that i can put it on the wall. I would only recomend this product if you buy the warrenty for it. Everything else was great. I am now looking for one that is similar but that i can hook my mp3 player up to it."
1,Save the Warranty Papers,These seem to work pretty well unless the bulb burns out. I don't think it is possible to replace the bulb and not ruin this dimmer. Save your warranty papers. Howsand@aol.com
1,Worst Tent Ever Owned,"This was our third tent owned. We loved the roominess (able to fit king size air mattress, two children's cots and two full size dog beds, plus a camping potty) and the ability to put up awning.I'll start with the awning. Very easy to install, but unsteady during winds. The first rain shower this tent took in 90 gallons of water. Thankfully, we were camping on our own property! Took hours using our 10 gallon wet-dry vac to get out the water. We put the tent in our barn to dry out the rest of the way, and since we didn't stake it down the poor thing fell over putting a good size gash in it's rainfly. No tears shed, but it will be missed.Purchased a smaller Coleman Instant tent & absolutely love it!!!! In one fall weekend camped at two cub scout family campouts and able to put this tent up with my 10 y/o son and I. Haven't experienced rain with this one yet."
2,Water wings,"They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made."
1,Two words for ya: Weird City,"Maybe I'm just one of the mindless masses. Maybe I'm just not a ""real"" music fan. Maybe I don't read the Bible enough. Maybe my favorite # is 5, so 82 means nothing to me. Maybe frogs just scare the living hell out of me. Maybe the movie theater wasn't ventilated well enough and the 6'6"" bald guy in front of me chewing on his ice, blocking my view for 3 hours made me lose my usual Siskelian like focus while watching this movie.Or maybe......this is just one stupid movie! Are you people out of your MINDS? The only good thing to come out of this movie was the soundtrack--THAT'S where your message is! Stop trying to read into directors' minds--oooh, what was he SAYING in this scene? To enjoy this movie, you needed to be high on drugs. I don't do drugs. Or maybe I should start, since I just didn't freakin get it. This movie made me feel all gooey--like frog glop on a windshield."
2,Very good,"OK! My english is very poor (bad educative system!) so i'll try to be clear as crystal. It's a very, very good book if you want to draw with ink! Very clear and very well explained. I'm a beginer and i recommend it."
1,Broke on third day,"Clasps broke on third day of use. I will not pretend that there is not a possibility of inexperienced use here, but the part that failed seemed like the most unlikely to fail in the mechanism. Of the alternatives, however, they seem like they would be solid by comparison when used best."
1,Poor QA by Wilson Jones,"I ordered 3 Wilson Jones 3"" hanging binders. Two of the binder were not usable. Amazon did replace them quickly, however the two replacements still had split covers. They can be used but needed to be taped."
1,I keep my 70-200 F/4,"This lens is anything from being sharp at 400mm and auto focus is not very precise. I bought this lens for a trip to Costa Rica and many photos turned out unusable, and few are OK. To get this lens somewhat OK at 400mm range, you need to shoot at F8 or F11, because F5.6 is just too soft. I have done test with my Canon 70-400 F/4 L lens compared to 100-400mm lens, both shot at far end of zoom, and 70-200f/4 resulted in better sharpness at F4 at the same crop size! I don't need couple stops of stabilization, auto focus works properly, bokeh looks the same, I have flexibility with crop and I saved myself $1200 and my shoulders for carrying heavier lens. Sold my 100-400mm lens on eBay few days ago. I use 5D Mark II, but I believe crop sensor will have similar results. Hope this was helpful. I only wish I would do the same test before I left to Costa Rica. Darn it. ....and just to mention, I did compared this lens to my friends, just to make sure it wasn't a lemon from eBay."
1,Not for everyone,"Fans of R.A. Lafferty will likely appreciate this one, but I lost interest and patience not far into the book. Probably a better book than I give it credit for, but I just can't do semi-silly any more."
1,It's only usable under low temperature...,"Netgear has great exterior design, however, its hardware inside is totally useless. It frequently stop working in higher temperature, by that, I mean 70F, especially when more than one people connect to it. It works fine for a while (but still slower than its optimal speed) after replug the power cord. However, I still need to replug it at lease once a day. And it's not just my netgear have problem like that, but also my friend's and the dialing one (different model, but with the same issue) in my apartment. So before Netgear fixes this problem, I won't buy any netgear router for a while."
2,Cute Quips,"A small giftbook or something to put on your desk as a conversation piece. A collection of jokes, lists and definitions to bring a few smiles. Some are original jokes, others have been around for awhile."
2,I heard ten-minutes of this CD and went out and bought it.,I heard a couple of a tracks from this CD and I went out and bought it. The group is the most original Ska/Punk group I have encountered in awhile. I hope to find previous CD's from the band.
2,Very well written,"I'm not one to read autobiographies. And wasn't looking forward to reading this one but it was our bookclub selection one month. So I began to read and was very surprised when the next thing I knew, I was done. This book is very informative. I learned so much from it. 5 stars!"
2,good for the price,I bought this so my son could have a pocket to stash his car stuff in. So far so good. The price was good.
2,A Lady Detective,"This book was delightful to read. It has the flavor of Alexander Smith's Ladies #1 Detective Agency. I wonder if he read this and got the idea to begin his series. It's also a ""feel good"" story as Maisie goes from rags to middle class independent women which is unusual way back around WWI. It's part historical fiction and part mystery. Maisie is intuitive, smart and resourceful.I think you will know if you like this book by the end of the first chapter. It's first in a series and I already have the next one."
1,Narrator was not so great,"The story itself is great, but I was not so thrilled with the narrator of this audiobook. When he read the parts spoken by Ms. Manette he sounded like Harvey Fierstein in drag. I wish I had returned it and bought a different edition because I love listening to the story."
2,The New Dare to Discipline,"If you dare!.........it makes alot of sense.I have a very strong willed child who's tantrums are quite the performance, so far what Dobson has advised works.Recommended to me by a child psychologist and friend."
2,My childhood favorite revisted,"Oh what a joy to see Sam and Sarrin and Endora etc. in DVD magic. This was such a great show. (Unfortunately,) I am old enough to remember when it first premiered. It was one of those shows that everyone watched and loved. It was funny, magical, romantic, family oriented. The best. The first season were the best. Another show I never tire of, especially the first few seasons."
2,Great sound funky retro looks,"It gave me totally great sound, no buzzing a low bass and not extremely high in tweet pitch.And every one giggling how its look when see me wearing it."
2,A great book!,Caleb's Curse is one of the best books I have read in a long time. The characters were so intriguing I imagined myself along side of them every step of the way. The Author paints such a vivid image of coastal carolina I could almost feel the ocean breeze. I look forward to more books by Sally Glass
1,Something changed,"I have purchased this exact product for at least 10 years for my daughter, as she loves them. For some reason even after returning and trying again, these did not fit. She has NOT lost weight, her foot has not changed. She just kept walking out of the heel but the length was ok. We returned them AND had to pay for shipping again. WeJungle Moc Nubuck Kids by Merrell are very disappointed. A few years ago she told me she felt the quality of them changed for the worse, didn't last as long but she still loved them. NOw it seems she will have to find an alternative. So sad."
1,"If You Have a Good Program, You Don't Need This","It's a nice book, but if you have a good Word Study program you don't need it. I especially wouldn't recommend it if you are using Words Their Way. I bought this book thinking it would be a handy thing to have the students make their own letter books. The cover designs of each mini book is nice I suppose, but I wouldn't recommend buying this book if you are already using Words Their Way or another good phonics program. You'll find it's a nice book but ultimately just a waste of money that can go towards something else."
2,Liked It Even If I Don't Agree With Everything,"Here's my honest review:Pros: The book really pulls together the concept of living healthier in your senior years nicely. The structure was tight and the various examples of diet and lifestyle and how they impact health was good.Cons: The book is a bit on the long side for my taste because I prefer books I can read through fast and get the points dead on. The authors advocates meat (in moderation) but my personal views do not support meat eating so we can disagree on this. The financial section of the both seemed a bit out of place and I felt it could have been a companion book.Overall, I like this book and it reminds me ofEating4Eternity.org: Unlock Your Holistic Health Lifestyle (The Holistic Health Nurse Series)which is a lighter read and more to the point but also focuses on a plant based diet. Both books promote healthy living but Jenny's book contains a meal plan which is a great bonus."
1,Ridiculous CD,"I initially really enjoyed the fast pace of this book, but was pretty dismayed to find out that the CD for this Maya 8 book only has Maya 7 on it. How could this have happened? Its nonsense."
2,Cute even for a grown up...,"My best friends daughter has this game and it is my favorite to play everytime I'm over visiting, and I'm 27 years old. Very adorable graphics, and a scroll side to side game which I prefer. You collect food items and it is very cute. Fairly easy, but for a girl who grew up with Strawberry shortcake it brings back old memories and a lot of fun. I've only gotten to level 2 but don't play it for more than half an hour so I don't know how hard it gets."
2,Nike + running system,"Great idea, could be a little more user friendly. I've heard bad things about battery life, time will tell if this is true. So far, so good."
2,"GREAT STEAMER, Great price","I bought this steamer to clean our new NY apartment. So far I have cleaned all the grout and tiles in the bathroom, and it reaches that awful place behind the toilet :-) We also steam cleaned all the walls in preparation for a new paint job. This is a great steamer with good attachments! You can only steam for an hour at a time but in all honesty, your arms get tired after an hour anyway. I would highly recommend this product to all mom's who are looking for a safer way to clean without harsh chemicals."
2,So Hot,"I fell in love the first time I saw it at the store.I had to have it. Its grate! Its lite make sharp turns in the house "" havent takin it out waiting for baby girl"". My Husband didnt whant it becuse it was Pink thats why I whanted it. He refused. But two days later its in my living room waiting for Cinnamon."
2,The Greatest Ever,"I'm so glad they combinded He's Greatness' Gifts, Talent and SuperHuman abilities on Blue Ray and Dvd. It was great to see he's AIRNESS in action again. This is a must have for your collection."
2,spaniards?,"the ""spaniards"" soldiers, of the X legion are always, like the Cortes, Pizarro and Frnacisco Franco soldiers, people from Spain, spanish soldiers, with litlle or none roman blood and of course the ""spanish"" roman cesars are indee of roman blood."
1,Awful voice -- boring music,"I found this CD to be ultra-boring.... Although Norah Jones' voice has been described as wonderful, I found it to be annoying -- she has no vocal range and she doesn't do much with what she has!! There are many other singers that have wonderful voices and singing styles -- I wouldn't waste my time or money on this CD...."
2,Not The Greatest Pattern Book,"I guess I was expecting a little more variety. There are some nice simple patterns here, nothing outstanding. It's a good book for beginner-to-moderate stained glass skills."
2,Very good product,"1. Assembled with no trauma in under two hours2. Heavy, solid ""footprint"", no wobble3. Completely silent, smooth, impact-free4. Good range of pre-programmed workout options5. Pulse feature not accurate6. Timers count either up or down (your choice).In summary, perfectly satisfactory, probably worth more than purchase price.---------P.S.: Within the warranty period the display went out. After faxing a copy of my invoice to the company I promptly received a replacement."
1,Completely outrageous!,"You've got to be kidding me! Could this be any more Orwellian??? ""Fostering a dispositon for activism"" is one of the topics in this book. The classroom is a wholly inappropriate place to be indoctrinating young children in questionable leftist rhetoric and activism. Many parents would be agahst if they knew their children were being recruited as the next generation of protesting myrmidons."
1,worthless product,"This filter does not stop any noise generated by electronic ballasts. I sent it back to Leviton because I thought it was defective. They returned it to me, saying it was ok. Don't waste your money."
2,A good piece of regional fiction,"Being not the biggest fan of fiction, I found myself captivated by ""Winterkill"" largely due to Lesley's vivid descriptions of my hometown and the land where I grew up.Lesley may not possess the greatest storytelling ability. His plot does sag and drag and suffers from underdevelopment.That said, ""Winterkill"" makes for a fine read due to Lesley's characters: a family of modern day Nez Pearce Indians and his aforementioned depictions of a specific regional space. I have hunted and hiked Red Elk canyon and currently live on the Umatilla River, attend the Round-Up on a yearly basis, drive by the Dalles Indian long house and teach in Pendleton: all settings described in this book. It really is quite fun to read a story taking place in areas I am familiar with.All in all a fine piece of regional fiction well worth a look."
1,Returned a faulty unit,"I had one for about a month and used it extensively. The recording quality was okay for a musical sketchbook, but my unit would lock up after about 2 and a half minutes of recording time, I'd have to take out the battery, and the recording would be garbage. I decided to return it and wait for some units with more features (recording level control mainly).Playback was nice though - and I found the software reasonably easy to use and install on XP. I didn't see any driver problems.The unit itself is small and convient to use and carry. It seemed pretty well-built for the price.It is what it is, a full-ish featured, low-end mp3 recorder."
2,"Roll one boss? Not now, boy!","If there is one prison movie stereotype that was missed in this one, I don't know which one it was. Brutal guards, sadistic warden, psychotic inmates, chain gangs, you name it, it has it. Still, it is entertaining from beginning to end and worth the money. Reynolds gives a fairly convincing performance (as does nearly everyone else.)Now, as has been pointed out by at least one other reviewer, any similarities to what this flick portrays and the reality of a real prison (now) are coincidental. Yes, there are bad wardens, bad correctional officers, and, yes, good inmates. These are, however, the exceptions and not the rule.See this one, anyway. It is, after all, fiction.(p.s. Unlike most people who post up here, I work in a real prison (not as an inmate or correctional staff, but as a school teacher...)"
2,WOW-this is a surprise,"I was in Barnes and Nobles one day and I hear the song Valentine playing which I knew because I am a Martina McBride fan, but I am also a Jim Brickman fan. I was suprised to learn that the women singing was Oliva-Newton John. There is also a song with Donny Osmand on the CD. When I first saw Donny Osmands name all I could think was chessy seventy's music. But then when I listened to it, I actually liked the song that Donny Osmand sings. Which will make me the laughing stock of my family for a few days. Oh well. Anyway this is the best Jim Brickman cd I have heard. All the songs even the ones with the artists singing are some of the best on the album. It's worth buying!"
1,Bought it then Returned It,"I bought this due to some neat features like extra frames and internal memory but when i put is side by side with one that I got as a gift (Nu Vue 560) there was a big difference in picture quality. Tried to adjust the contrast, etc. but could not get it as good as the one I had."
1,It should be better,"When I saw the preview for this I could not wait for it to come out. Then I figured it did poorly at the theatre due to bad timing. But that was not the case.It has poor flashbacks, poor casting (other than 2 people) and where is the music, romance or any kind of enemy to hate?She is one dimensional (she can fight).In similar movies, An equally matched adversary or specialist is sent to take down the star of the movie. In Haywire the audience sees that the attacker(aka enemy) is not a specialist at all. Matter of fact Mallory (played by Gina Carano) actually replies, ""They sent you?"". And I know what she meant after the ending credits.The Casting Director did not do a good job. Other than Gina Carano and Michael Douglas you have a bunch of bad selections.Its a Jason Bourne type formula that was poorly executed. She's made for these types of movies and its time for a female version of Jason Bourne."
1,I returned this book!!,"This book is proof that you can't (or shouldn't) make a silk purse out of a sow's ear! I would wear 10% of what is shown in the book, not more than that. Make no mistake, I DO value creativity, if and ONLY if, the finished product is pleasing to the eye. Most of the projects in this book looked like a preschooler made them from junk fished out of a trash barrel at the hardware store. A necklace made from shriveled orange peels?! Some of the items looked positively dangerous to wear; sharp pieces of jagged metal!..."
2,Overall satisfied,"Overall, I am satisfied with the chair. It arrived in a reasonable timeframe. I have two comments on it. First, I wish it were available with adjustable footrests. Second, one of the front casters was two tight causing the chair to want to go in circles and be hard to push. A few seconds with a wrench solved that problem. A simple check at assembly should have found this before it was boxed for shipment."
1,Blech! Not worth reading.,"This was an incredibly aggravating and disappointing book. The book is not a story, it is just random scribbles and background from his attempts to create the the Belgariad and the Mallorean. To add to the annoyance, most of this background was changed in the actual writing of the books. I suppose it might be useful for aspiring writers, but I doubt it. The best lesson might be not to publish this kind of stuff! The preponderance of arrogant snide remarks directed to the reader left a bad taste in my mouth. I enjoyed the Belgariad and the Mallorean, but I don't know if I can enjoy re-reading them after this."
2,martial arts shoes,"For what I expected these to be, just a basic pair of martial arts shoes these are great. They serve their purpose and hold up well. Also, I kinda like that low cut look from the kung fu movies. Good shoes get'em to start off with, if I you have the money though and really want to invest in something progress to something else in the future."
2,A classic for one and all...,"When I lived in Boston I would go to hear Isabel Hickey at Boston University; her lectures were such a joy. There are so few great philosophers and metaphysicians today who give themselves in this way. I recommend this particular astrology book to all my students at Santa Fe Community College, where I teach the psychic crafts, and to my psychic and astrological clients. Hickey is almost always right-on with her ""psychological astrology"" readings. Everyone who is interested in astrology should own this book."
1,Yet again...,"I get so excited when I see a book where the main character has the flaws we can all relate to. She's an emotional wreck, struggles with her weight, her frizzy hair, her overwhelming thankless job. But - and here be the spoilers!! - I get so disgusted when, time and time again, these characters make an impossible transition, discovering some amazing talent they never knew they had. From being an incompetent waitress to a fabulous pastry chef, from the frizzy hair to the silky ringlets, finding the perfect man who's hopelessly in love with her, and transforming a cutting arsonist into a well-rounded teenager. All this and so much more - within a year. It's not even believable."
2,Vtech sit-stand walker,"Good product overall. Serves its purpose. Not sure if it can be rated as educational toy, but a good one to start with."
1,Audigy 2 is better,"First, be forewarned that this soundcard/external box system requires an extra power connection inside your computer. If you do not have a spare power connection, then the external box is useless--and that means no MIDI connections (no keyboard), no mike, etc. etc.Second, the card itself. Uses a 32-bit audio engine. It is widely believed that the more bits, the better. However, some sources say that the bits above 16 are mainly noise, with some increased definition. At any rate, recording or playing soundfonts with this soundcard produces very harsh-sounding instruments. This may be what you want if you're writing rock music. If you're writing chamber music, choose a different card."
1,Danger! - Ball Came Off On First Swing,"Ball is cheaply attached by glued, knotted nylon line, and came flying off with on first strike. Not only did the ball come off, but blew a hole in my garage siding. Very dangerous, and low quality."
1,Pretty Weak!,"I have bi-polar disorder, and I will say that this is only a fair history of manic depression. For that alone I give it two stars. The actors in this half hour documentary seem to overdo the disorder. It would be funny were it not so tragic."
2,Spectacular,"Absence of the Good is definitely a thriller. If you like movies that keep you on the edge of your seat. While keeping you in suspense then you will love this one! The plot was wonderfully done, and you will never guess who the killer is and will leave you saying WOW!"
2,No Apologies...,"I know alot of Iron Maiden fans despise this record,but I like it.It does have some bad songs,no doubt or arguments there.But it also has some good one such as run silent,run deep,fates warningand the title track.Ok,so only 3 good songs and a couple other decent ones.But its enough to save the record in my view."
2,A Very Strange Road Trip,"This is a lighthearted memoir of a road trip involving Einstein's brain in a tupperware bowl, tucked in the trunk. I kept wondering how you might explain that to the authorities if you were unlucky enough to be pulled over while driving! There are several colorful characters that are weaved into the story, but I found myself imagining Harvey like an eccentric old neighbor. You know... the kind where they are just odd enough that nothing really surprises you anymore, where they lean towards 'funny' rather than 'scary'. The stories of the controversy surrounding the fate of the brain can be quite amusing. If you think the kids will argue over who gets the prized trinkets, would you go so far as to think they'd argue over who gets your brain after you're gone?"
2,The people behind the stethescopes...,"Doctors follows a class of Harvard med students throughout their careers and gives the reader a personal look at the people they really are...the things that make their heart ache, the things that keep them awake at night, the things that keep them going"
2,It is just plain great!,"You always wanted to know about Norman Bates' childhood. This movie lets you see it. Yet, when all the smoke is cleared, the movie gives you a chill that no matter what happeneds, you will always be in danger. The movie a s a great ending. Some movies just say the killer dies (Halloween H20 for instance), but in this movie, the killer is still after you and there is nothing you can do..."
2,Almost perfect,"I love duoderm products, for wound care they can not be beat. They help speed up healing time exponentially. The only problem with the thin version is that it leaves a sticky residue on the skin. It also sometimes moves/rips before it is time to be removed which enhances the sticky residue. The thick version of the product I give 5 stars but the residue makes me take off one star for the extra thin. In terms of how well the product works for wound healing I would give it 5 stars as well."
2,The girls are so fun together,I enjoyed the book and did not want it to end. I would love a sequel to keep following al of the girls
1,Dry as toast,I don't know how someone this interesting can make a documentary this dull.And 3 dvd's! I bought this to show my students and can find very few elements that won't send them to sleep.This material is found in much better outlets elsewhere.I'll never use this.
1,"Don't buy, replace the hose","This part is designed to NOT be removable. Once inserted into a tank even with 5-10 ft-lbs of torque, it cannot be removed with the plastic lug provided. The lug will sear off and you will have nw way to remove it. Convienent when you are selling these connectors, it would be easy enough to make teh llugs out of metal.Once this occurs, you will need to have the tank refilled. This eliminated the common option of simply swapping your empty tank for a new full tank that has the standard connector fitting. For about $20-$25 you can replace your non-standard quick connect on your weber with a new hose/regulator that has the standard oversized female connector."
2,best anti-aging beauty product ever,"my friend who recently finished esthetician school recommended this product to me. she said that it mimics skin's natural oils and absorbs better than any other oil. i have been using it on my face at night for about four months now and i swear there is a dramatic difference. my skin looks smoother and plumper and my wrinkles are far less noticeable. i have always been quite skeptical of beauty products that claim to ""turn back the clock,"" but this one really does. I have never been so sold on something in my entire life. mark my word, once more people catch on to this stuff it's going to be the next miracle treatment. IT REALLY WORKS, and, oh yeah, it's way cheaper than all those potions you can buy at the Macy's cosmetic counter that don't really do much more than Pond's."
2,"Making It All Come to Life, Laughing All the Way","If you have never cruised before, this book will put you right there. You can vicariously try it out before putting your money down. And if you are one of the 11 million people who cruised last year, this book will transport you back to the promenade deck, back to gazing at the wake of the ship, back to enjoying the great food and great service and to exploring the islands.Chester comes alive on the page as a likeable everyman with a sense of humor. The book's major flaw is that it is too short."
2,Great normal looking girls,"I love this title, the music is so-so but atleast it isn't anoying like most of the time. The girls are normal looking, with a few silicon here and there. What sells this dvd is how cheerful some (not all) of the models are when they are dancing. The camera moves at different angles, sometimes giving a top or bottom view in just the perfect way. I wish the producer would consentrate more on the setting around the models a bit more instead of fixing a camera on a model for 10 mins. Those 10 mins can be charming or boring if the model are not of your type."
2,An Honorable Book for an Honorable Man,I am sorry that some people believe that this book was just a recap of Band of Brothers because it is not.This book tells how Major Winters started and worked his way from a young man to where he is now. The focusing of the one man filled in the holes that the book and movie Band of Brothers left me with.This man did not have goals of granduer but just wanted to do his job and he wanted to do his job well. I think that lesson is still applicable for today.Well written book that adds to what we already knew about the man. Yes some of what we read is seen in the book and the movie but it is much more personal and focused.I hope Richard Winters can finish his life in peace because he deserves it.
1,Didn't get suckered in,"Well, I for one didn't get suckered into buying this disc, but from what I hear if you've got ""The Collection"" this album is not worth buying at all. It's all old songs from the beginning of her career; nothing more recent from when she hit it bigtime. I will never buy this one. Heck, I don't even have ""Collection""; I'd rather buy that one first.This one is just released for the record company to make some money. It isn't even her current record company who released this anyway. They didn't even know abou this one."
1,DOA Receiver,"Turned on OK, but wouldn't play anything, AM, FM, CD, DVD, or TV Sound. Returned without replacement because selection button labels too hard to see in normal lighting. Kudos to Amazon's 30-day return policy."
1,Meant for a moment,Severely dated and faded cornball psych-rock with occasional compositional fortitude penetrating gratingly showy vocals.
2,Great sports bra that gives all the support you need,It was difficult to find a bra that would provide the support I needed for running. Although I don't run more than 6 miles all the other sports bras I found still allowed movement which I found terribly uncomfortable. The fiona has no underwire and is super comfortable and keeps everything in its place. I'm definitely buying more.
2,Very clever and good Edgar Allan Poe story,"My daughter is in the tenth grade and she is doing a book report on Mr. Poes short stories and poems. Why she picked Poe's work is beyond me. She likes Harry Potter and Star Wars movies and books, so I think its just curiousity. As a concerned parent I listened to Edgar Allan Poe:A Love Story and found it very absorbing. This book on tape does go back to the old radio show style of writing. When I was in the service, we would always look forward to good shows on the radio (it reminded us of home). I am impressed that these producers chose to make a presentable book on tape for young people. I also noticed the author, Xavier Carbajal, wrote a novel called Captain Nemo. I plan to give that one a look too."
1,"Nothing special, few problems, underwhelming quality","I am not a big fan of the product. Doesn't seem as thick or high quality of material as a 10mil tarp that they have at any big box store. Not a terrible quality, but not as high as the same priced option at your local store.The biggest issue is that it looks like the grommets are poorly attached to the tarp. Many of them are already slightly separated from it and there is a gap between the metal of the grommet and the tarp material, and this was even BEFORE using it. Right out of the package on the day it arrived.Needless to say I am just hoping it makes it through the winter without coming apart. I can tell by the quality of it that it is only going to last 1 winter covering my already canvas covered boat.FYI, a 12x20 tarp fits a 17 ft v bottom alumnium sylvan very well, even one with a windshield."
1,dont purchase anything from this seller,"The seller false advertized. He/she used the picture of the book I bought and sent a completely different book.The book took two weeks to get to me. On arrival the incorrect book was wrapped in a used paper grocery bag that was ripped in multipe places. Upon contacting the seller of the problem, they refused to remedy the problem. No refund, for their bogus product. Dont waist your money purchasing anything from this seller, they will only rip you off!"
2,Lots of fun--different from other Austen-centered works,"""The Friendly Jane Austen"" was well-written and, most of all, great fun. I chose not to give it 5 stars because some of the analysis of Austen's work is rather silly (i.e. reading 20th-century mindsets into 18th-19th century literature--claiming Emma has homosexual feelings for Harriet Smith). Also, because Jeremy Northam deserves at least 4 ""E""s on the ""Elton Vulgarity Scale"" for his uncouth comment about Emma! He may be right about her, but was the obscenity really necessary! While I thought some of the sexual analysis was ridiculous, it was interesting to learn that some people actually interpret Austen in this way."
2,Excellent!,"These short comics are just as I remembered them as a young boy. This is so great how they can reproduce some things lost in childhood. I suggest to pass these great, clean, energetic cartoons for your young family and friends."
2,A treasure,"Its a treasure believe me ,i have many DVDs and this one stand as the best one I've bought (like the Bret Hart DVD).It has tons of great matches and its a must have for new wrestling fans to learn what the business was and how it evolved .For old school fans you will LOVE the first DVD because its great and for Hogan fans this DVD has the best matches of Hogan in WWF. The time line alone deserve the price because it contains every title change that ever happened in a quick time line(with 2 or 3 exceptions because it was too old and not filmed)SO buy it and you will not regret it,but please be aware that after watching the dvds you will hate the wrestling world and how it transfered from the greatest matches between legends to jokes like Cena and Umaga."
2,"Great guitarist, great music","Christopher Parkening is a wonderful guitarist. On this release one can hear how wonderfully subtle a soloist he is. His phrasing on the largo movement of Vivaldi's Concerto in D (track 2) is particularly poetic. The Vivaldi pieces here are my favorites; I especially like the Trio in C (tracks 13-15). The combination of harpsichord, violin, and guitar is magical, making for some delicious baroque chamber music. In short, I highly recommend this recording."
2,Britney's Best Yet,"I'll admit, I've been a big Britney fan from the very beginning but I think from an objective standpoint, this is her most competent album to date. Contrary to some of the recent press coverage, the album is not that sexual in its lyrical content. There are a few lines here and there but I've heard far worse on the radio.Musically, the tracks have some of the catchiest hooks I've heard in a while. And I think she successfully incorporated other musical genres from trance, to hip-hop, to dancehall. I think this album will have great staying power based on the strength of potential singles like ""(I've Got That) Boom Boom"", ""The Hook up"", and ""Breathe on Me"". The song ""Everytime"" is a very simple, poignant reflection on lost love that comes across beautifully. All in all, I think even non-Britney fans would enjoy this album and I highly recommend it.(...)If you're a Britney fan, you'll love it. If you're not, give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2,Godzilla destroyes Japan once more.,Godzilla against Japans army.No Oxygen Destroyer this time.Get this movie if you want to know how Japan gets rid of him this time. Movie #16 of 23.
2,Motorcycle Sunglasses,"The case is good. It isn't as spring loaded to shut as I'd like but it's certainly solid and strong enough to ride in the saddle bag and protect my sunglasses. I wear bobster foamerz and bobster desperados and they barely fit in the case, but they DO fit and these are bigger sunglasses. I would recommend this to someone looking to protect their sunglasses because it's the best I've found thus far."
2,As good as a tribute album gets,"I hate Megadeth, i hate biohazard, and i really hate Sepultura. Biohazard has this lame ass ebonics intro to After Forever. And the vocals from Megadeth and Sepultura are just plain shit. On a positive note is Type-O Negative. The original version of Black Sabbath is way overrated. I personally think it is just a flat out bad song. TON really does some work to it and makes it listenable. It is a good album even though i do'nt listen to a third of it."
2,A MUST READ!!,"God bless you, Michael Evans, for writing this timely and very informative book! I am absolutely sure that God has worked through you to inform people that the end times are here and that this nation had best ""get it's act together"" and pay attention to biblical prophecy. I was one of those who are ignorant about the roots of terrorism and found myself shaking my head in disbelief many times. So, folks, set aside that novel for now, and absorb some of Michael Evans knowledge!"
2,Nailed it!,"This has found where a good portion of Christians are at right now in this world and the disrray it is in...we want to put off the phoniness of the ""Church Inside the Building"" and find the TRUE relationship that we are suppose to have with our creator and his people!!!!!"
1,Don't buy it,"I tried to upgrade from XP to Vista. I have a very powerful PC - 3GB and dual core processor and sufficient graphic card - but Vista only does about 90% of what it should be doing. Two major problems are after installing vista I can not deinstall firewalls and virus scanners that don't work under vista but that keep screwing up my system. Second big thing, I have two computer screens and the second screen is turned by 90 degrees. Vista does not like that at all. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T INSTALL VISTA. IT IS NOT WORTH THE NIGTHMARE."
1,A BIG (BLOCK) DISAPPOINTMENT,"Well one of the other reviewers is 100percent right. While full of technical info, the book is WAY OUTDATED. Many of the GM parts listed are no longer available, there is no mention of GM Perforamnce Parts engines, or the GEN V and GEN VI big blocks since this book was written in the 70's, and as mentioned by someone else here, claims aftermarket parts are usually inferior. Not true today. The book should be updated at a minimum. A nice read if you are restoring an old Vette or Chevy. But if you are looking to build a modern big block, look elsewhere."
2,Wonderful TV,This has been a great TV. Very clear picture. The white glove setup was a real plus. Especially like that only a card is needed for HD rather than a settop box.
2,Better Than Airplane Glue,"In my opinion this is the best record ever. If you don't like it right away, it's probably because you have really bad taste, but that's okay. Just give it time and the music will fix you right up. It's really dense, packed full with all sorts of good stuff; reggae, punk, ska and stuff that just rocks. The lyrics sound like what you'd hear eavesdropping on the coolest party ever. The songs are simple, a little sloppy in places, yet that just gives this CD more energy. It's one of those records that every single song takes it's turn being your favorite."
1,Alternative,"I think many sorority members who are interested in reading this book should buy a used copy on-line and share it with fellow members. Personally, I would not want Ms.Robbins to get any profits from this book! I hope no one thinks that these things are prevalent at every school or chapter."
1,Cute way to subtly teach children how to act like spoiled brats,"This story definitely has an agenda. It is very cute, I must admit, but I would never read this to my child because it promotes values that I do not want to instill in my children. The cows (and chickens) in the story become discontent with living like every other cow lives. It is not enough that the cows are fed, live in a barn, and are well provided for...they want more! So they appeal to the farmer, refusing to do their part to contribute, until the farmer meets their ""demands."" In my opinion, this story teaches children that making unrealistic demands is okay and, even worse, that you can act like a spoiled brat and get your way! Too bad the cows aren't being grateful for what they have and trying to help less fortunate cows by welcoming them into their barn at night instead...then I might read this story to my children."
2,A real Gem.,All I want to say is I love this book. I will read it again and again. I also plan on buying copies for friends
2,Best diaper,"This is truly the best diaper for babies. I have put all three of my little ones in this diaper and it performs great. Super soft, no rashes and no leakage. Once they are crawling and mobile I switch but these are truly the best for little babies."
2,hank Williams,Excellent. Awesome all of Hank hits with the lyrics and guitar chords easy to play great for anybody just taking up guitar. A must have for Hank Williams. Fans and guitar players
1,Not good for an engineer,"Mainly for managers, more concepts. Too much talking about concept stuff. Hard for engineers to read."
2,Very Relaxing DVD,"I really like this DVD, though I didn't use it as much as I had planned. The instructor is a little off the wall at times, but the exercises are great and helpful."
1,Poor quality,We had another one that worked fine but on this one the handle keeps falling apart and lid wont stay on.
2,scally,"I've read a lot of these kind of books and I found this one to be the best so far. He tells it like it happened and if he took a beating he told you so.Some of these type of books get a bit repetative . . . "" we charged into them and they ran"" etc.etc. . . this book wasn't like that.It was humorous at times, as expected cos he's from Liverpool and we all know they have a great sense of humor.It was a great read and i look forward to more stuff from Andy Nicholls."
2,This Toy is great!!,"This is my first vibrator and I am very pleased. I am very closely built and many times sex can be painful. This toy is not too big and the rotating tip is great! The material does smell weird but I just use a condom and wash it after every use. It does not stink up my house either, I would recommend this to anyone who is concerned about not getting a toy that's too big. BUY THIS I'VE BEEN SMILING ALL DAY :)"
2,Classic Spider-Man,"The one where it all began, Marvel Masterworks: Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1 is an essential addition to any Spidey collector. The premise: A young student Peter Parker struggles with issues of acceptance and success, but when he is bitten by a radioactive spider, he realizes that destiny has something in store, for he is to become Spider-Man! The villains are juicy, the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane Watson is genuine and the artwork is spectacular. A fantastic beginning to an amazing comic!"
1,Not a book for the creative....,"If you're the typical GM who creates and populates his own world, then this book is not for you. It does a wonderful job of listing pre-made villians, but presents very little to help you make your own. So, if you're only interested in cut-and-paste villians, this is perfectly fine, but if you like to create and flesh out your own villians, don't even bother with this one."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","I bought this book years ago and regretted it immediately. They recipes are ridiculously unflavorful. Why write a cookbook if you don't really want to share your recipes? I kept the book only because I hate to throw my cookbooks out and maybe I hope one day I'll find something I could enjoy in it. The peach cobbler recipe is ok but even it needs tweaking and she advises using half peaches and I hate huge peaches in my cobbler. So I use sliced.I was very disgusted that she would rip us off this way. I ate in her restuarant in 2002 and was not impressed then either. It was not bad but definitely not delicious either. Even if she comes out with another cookbook, I've lost my trust with this one. Anyone who gives this 5 stars doesn't know jack."
1,"Interesting, but Halting","An interesting book, I found myself reading and rereading entire passages. Not only because I enjoyed the text, but also because the translation was sometimes so awkward that I had trouble making sense of some sections. Perhaps the next edition will be better produced."
2,Fits perfect,"Boot fits perfectly with some wiggle room at the toes. I wear size 9.5 but ordered the 9 hoping it wouldn't be too small. I plan on using these around the house for a lot of yard work, concrete cementing, and pressure washing so I got the one with steel toes. For the price it's worth it."
2,Amazing product,"My wife and I realized we couldn't stop the ""tears"" of our Maltipoo from staining her face, but we didn't stop looking for a ""cure"". And I found Angel Eyes!! It's easy to use and it WORKS. I'd recommend this product to any one who has a dog with a ""tear stain"" problem."
1,Hopeless,"The thing is supposed to change color (green or purple), but doesn't... I wouldn't buy it for 1 cent..."
1,need a degree to understand,"I didn't understand a word in this book, either did my son. I sent back. I wanted a book that translates what he predicted to what we can understand."
2,Excellent Product!,"This pocket pc by toshiba is one of the best products you can buy. It is extremely user-friendly to someone with basic computer knowledge, and is very easy to set up appointments, calendar dates, etc. If you follow the directions provided in the box, you will NOT have ANY problems with the device.Do NOT listen to any of the previous reviews telling you about problems with the e755 pocket pc. Not only have I never had to reset this pda, but I've not once experienced any problems with the software or operating system. I've also not once experienced any problems with wifi connecting to my home network. Everything synced perfectly with my laptop, no questions asked. The only problem I found was the battery life was rather short (4 hours), so I'd recommend the high capacity battery which is 3 times the length. Problem solved.In conclusion, I highly recommend this product to someone who wants one of the most powerful pocket pc's to date, and wireless highspeed internet access."
1,CHAPTER ONE!!!!!!,"Sometimes people take verses out of context to make their point. Others misinterpret the meaning (whether intentionally or not) and apply verses to situations that the originaly writer did not intend for it to be applied to. Very rarely does an author have the nerve to actually change the actually text of a Bible verse to support their statements.But these authors did it in the very first chapter. And in the rest of the book they go on and commit the other errors mentioned above.I do not dispute that this book may be an inspiration to some people, and I do not dispute much of what the authors are trying to say in this book. However, this is not the method by which I chose to learn or be inspired."
1,Bad Reference!!,"This book is chock full of errors. I don't have any faith in the contents of this book. Color codes of wires are incorrect in troubleshooting areas, and there is poor coverage of all model years, especially newer ones. The book tells you what fault codes are but it does not tell you how to access them. I own two Hondas and I end up using the internet to get the information this book, more often than not, neglects to include. Purchase at your own risk -- it's too bad that it is the only book on the market for many Honda models."
2,Good Knife Bad packaging,This Knife looked great but it was packed tight in a box so since it was rubber the knife doesn't look straight it will always look bent. I still used it for Halloween just had to tape to straight sticks on each side to keep it straight and I wrapped it in Tin Foil to make it stay together and shine. Its a good knife but next time please make you sure you pack it right :)
2,"Intelligent, nuanced, and well-researched","Bordewich's study of contemporary Indian politics stands out from the usual polemics, presenting humanity instead of stereotypes. More importantly, it focuses on the present and future of native Americans, not just the past, and does justice to the complexity and diversity of American Indian tribes. Borderwich's book was obviously a labor of love. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the most important issues and questions facing Indians and non-Indian Americans alike."
1,Stretching more than anything,"As the other review stated, zooming in and out on the faces (or other scenes) instead of showing the full body so that we can see what we should be doing. The entire collection is more stretching than anything and is so long (in length) that it gets frustrating. Thus far, I wish the producers had been more focused because I do not see a common goal in each segment.I like working out with the other lady in this DVD series rather than Shelly McDonald.In two sections of the DVD set, you need a Chi Ball and a Big Abs ball, which is not listed as needed items on the product."
1,Kindle version has major issues,"This is a review of the Kindle presentation of the book, not the book itself.There is one chapter which is presented in the form of a letter which has been marked up in pen by one of the characters. This chapter is presented as scanned full size pages. The font size on a Kindle 3 is minuscule, and the text is rendered in light grey rather than black. Due to these two issues, this important chapter is all but utterly illegible.The reading experience is truly unacceptable.I set the book aside and spent a week wondering about the fate of the protagonist before I finally forced myself to squint through the tiny grey text and on to the next chapter.There are numerous other minor formatting gaffs and hic-ups. These I don't mind, but they're surprising in such a popular book.All in all, I would suggest avoiding the Kindle version of this book. Read it on paper."
1,Never Recieved,"I was told UPS lost item, then was offered not the color I ordered Not happy at all !"
1,Junk,It doesn't get much worse than this. The audio quality is similar to sticking your head in a bucket and scraping metal objects around. The tape player ate one of my tapes. The tuner never seemed to work in the AM band... you could go 1/4 the way on the same station/static. To trust this alarm clock in waking you for you future is as smart as tricking yourself into thinking you'll get up 30 minutes after you hear your neighbors car start. Buy this only with a surplus of aspirin...
2,Robin,This is my all time favorite book. Christabel Judd and Cash are all well written characters. It is funny romantic and full of drama.
1,not warm,"If you plan to buy these for winter use to keep you hands warm - they surprisingly don'tStanley 4323-01 8-Ounce Brown Jersey Gloves, Large, 12-Pair are actually much warmer and also have a softer feeling to them.But both will not do it for sub freezing"
1,TOTAL B.S.,"Don't waste your money.After reading the positive reviews I thought I'd give these pills a try. I'm sure glad they were cheap because they performed about as good as a pint of ben & jerrys. NO appetite suppressing, NO extra energy, NOTHING! TOTAL EFFING GARBAGE if you ask me. I tried these other japanese diet pills that were supposed to be all natural and tho they made me feel terrible (slightly nauseated, a bit dizzy, extreme dry mouth, insomnia) I lost weight with no exercise or change of diet! I only took them for 1 week too!! I'll go back to those!!!!!!"
2,On time and in good condition,"My son loves the Lion King, so I was so happy to find the DVD on line. I paid extra to buy the DVD in new condition. When it arrived the disc looked new, but the packaging didn't. I've seen this DVD before in its original packaging, and this product did not include the original packaging. Some of the promotional material, for example, was missing. That said, I don't really care that much about the original packaging as long as the disc arrived in great condition, which it did."
2,Stanley 1/2 inch ratchet,Item was purchased as a part of a gift. The recipient was pleased with the selection and the item is in use daily on commercial construction sites by an electrician.
1,sengoku OR-77 Kero heater,"I have owned 4 kero heaters for 25 years and never had a unit that smelled.. I ordered this one for a replacement. The unit smelled when i started it - so I contacted Amazon and they replaceed it for me. The second unit smelled when running. I contacted the factory and the customer rep said ""get aneedle nose pliers and pull up the wick"".? I did so and it still smelled. I purchased a new wick and replaced it and it still smelled. I contacted the factory via 3 emails and received no response. I guess i'm stuck with this stinker. I purchased a new kero world KW-11f today - great!"
1,disappointed,I was so pleased that Sanders had written one last McNally caper before his death. Two chapters into the book I realized something was not quite right; Archie was not quite Archie. It was then I discovered that the book had not been written by Sanders. I won't read another.
1,Different,Just went to the store and found this. Can't imagine anybody could listen to the cd more than once. It sounds like my cat's standing on it!!!
2,Just a really great product,This product really does the job. I am extremely satisfied with the results cleaning the grout in my kitchen and foyer.
2,"Very, very good","Sure, it's short and has only three songs, but it's very good! The songs:Drowning: I think it's a little weak in vocals, but I still really like it. Fave lyrics: Are you drowning your fears/in a glass of deception?/When everything's hazy/Everything will be OK.Anyone, Anyone: Good, better vocally than Drowning in my opinion. Good lines: ""I can't see how the way that you leave me alone makes us close.""For Justin: A very sweet song: ""It's been a year now since you were here now/And I've been trying to heal inside/Dedications of how I placed/And I see your resemblance in my face/And our birthday I said an extra wish for you.""It receives only four songs simply because of it's short lenghth; otherwise it's good."
1,Murderous ending,"This book was reasonably entertaining, if not classic literature, until the end -- or, rather, the LACK thereof. After introducing all sorts of suspects and clues, the book doesn't even give a resolution. The main character, the story's sleuth, simply decides not to pursue her investigation any further. Thus we never find out who really murdered Tom Ince, or the identity of Mademoiselle X, or whether Abigail's death was really a suicide, et cetera, et cetera. Maybe this kind of ending is acceptable in an artsy, ""slice of life"" short story, but not in a whodunit. It left me feeling cheated"
1,Product never arrived,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift in December 2010 via Amazon and it never arrived. I just found out on April 5, 2011, and Amazon tells me it's too late to file a claim."
2,Classic MOVIE!!!!,"Highly recommended. All actors do an amazing job, even Camron! Easily one of the best hood movies out!"
1,Panasonic ES2045P Wet/Dry Epilator,"This is the best of all that I have tried and the best price also. The other brand I returned because it didn't work as they stated. This one works great, no pain and very few ingrown hairs. I haven't tried it wet yet as it works great dry.Love it- Love it- Love it. I give it ""5 stars"""
2,F5D7330 Ethernet Game Adapter,"Belkin products have always performed well for me, and the F5D7330 game adapter has proved to beno exception. I was able to obtain this one at a very reasonable price from an Amazon vendor,and have found it to perform perfectly as a wireless bridge for an Apple computer. On the strengthof that performance, I have purchased one more, albeit not through Amazon this time.This is a product I shall recommend to anyone seeking an ethernet alternative for a wireless bridgesolution for wireless access to a computer network."
2,a must read,not only the outfit but all other parker novels written by the peerless richard stark (donald westlake) are utterly thrilling and highly entertaining. but don't start to read a novel when you don't have enough time to finish it at once! real page turner!
2,Great Album by a Great Artist,"If you don't know Callahan, ""Sometimes I Wish I Were An Eagle"" might be a better place to start. It's a less dense and more fully realized album. Eagle has a straightforward, mature clarity where this album is cased in a darker atmosphere. Callahan is a master songwriter, and exerts his mastery with control and nuance. Admittedly, the deadpan, baritone vocals can make for a tough entry point; as Scott Walker once complained, ""baritone singing just puts people to sleep."" But again, he knows how to use his vocals to both guide and serve the songs."
2,One of her Best!,"Janet Jackson gets better and better! This CD is amazing, and it will really put you in the mood, if you know what I mean!"
1,ABSOLUTE PYLE OF CRAP,"BUYER BEWAREABSOLUTE PYLE OF CRAPDO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTTHIS INEXPENSIVE SUBWOOFER WAS A WEAK PERFORMER TO BEGIN WITH, BUT AFTER ONLY 35 DAYS IT NOW JUST THUMPS WHEN ENERGIZED$ 20 BUCKS TO SEND IT BACK TO MEET IT'S MAKER IN BROOKLYN - FOGET ABOUT IT, BUBBYTHE OTHER REVIEWERS WERE SPOT ON IN STATING THAT THE DEVICE WOULD STOP WORKING AFTER JUST A FEW WEEKS - I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THEIR ADVICE AND PURCHASED A HIGHER QUALITY PRODUCT FOR A FEW DOLLARS MOREI SEE THAT ALL OF THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS PRODUCT HAD SOMEHOW DISAPPEARED WHEN I CHECKED AMAZON TONIGHTI'll JUST BUY ANOTHER AMP AND GUT THE UNIT RATHER THAN TAKE A TOTAL LOSS ON THIS ILL ADVISED PURCHASE"
1,silverado,"Ididn't like this movie.Ithink it sucked.It hade no comedy and it was boring.I think westrn movie's for old people.silverado was a very boring movie.The actors were ugly and there clothes are ugly & dont match,the music sucks it made the movie worse then it was then it is.It wasn't my type of movie.i've seen western movies before i never llike them.I dont recomended to nobody."
1,Don't Bother,"We have loved our food saver for over 10 years. When it started to not seal, we decided to replace it with this model. After one day, we are shipping it back to Amazon. It does not suck!! It did seal a few bags, but so slowly and with poor suction. Then it stopped sealing entirely. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Weak construction,"The phone sound fine to me. The isolation is medicore compare to IEMs. The problem of this earbud is that the wire is sticky and thin. The result is the ruber that surround the wire splited open after about 4 months of usage with the fact that I store if in a box while I'm not using it. So if one wants to buy this, need to buy some extra warranty since the phone is so fragile."
2,Strongly recommended.,"This book is the best one I've bought. When I ordered it from Amazon.com, I expected the arrival of the book. When I got it last week, I was so excited. I was too impatient to read it. I have to say: ""It is too perfect!"" It was an accurate decision that I made. It is worthful to spend the money on. Thanks Amazon.com. Thanks the author, Ann Cook. Thanks God!"
1,Too Tight of a Fit --Disappointing,"This case is well made of high quality materials, but it has two major flaws: (1) This case is too small to accommodate the camera that it was designed for. It's just too tight of a fit. It needs another inch of room; (2) The case doesn't provide adequate protection from a fall. The material is just too soft. Unfortunately, it's made for people who don't drop cameras.I was really disappointed with this item. When will they finally get it right?"
2,Off the hook!!!,"This album is of the hook! Anybody who buys it will be satisfied! And if you don't like Trick, then you got some very big problems! Don't forget to buy his next album THUGS-R-US! The new single off that album "" THUG"" is the bomb for real! So go out and get both the cd's NOW!!!! For real!"
2,A interesting tale!,"What a different book. While reading I was asked what it was about, all I could say was - you have to read it. This was a sweet story- very easy to read that kept me well entertained until the very last page!"
1,No redeeming value.,"If I didn't believe in free speech, I would take a marker to scribble over second phrase of this sticker. Joking about murder is sick and insensitive. Also, you never know who is in the vehicle behind you. It could be a bereaved parent who had lost a young child. This insensitive sticker would only make them feel worse. Furthermore, if someone driving a vehicle with this sticker accidently hit a young child, I wonder if a judge or jury would factor in the sticker and consider that it might not have been an accident? I recommend passing on this tasteless sticker."
2,Spoiler in the ad at the beginning disc,"Each disk contains a short ad for other showtime series. This Ad previews the huge OMG moment of the season.You can't skip the ad. You can't jump to the menu. You can't fast forward.Why show a trailer for the product I just bought.Why put such a huge spoiler in the trailer.It's like opening the show by saying ""Bruce Willis is really a ghost, Verbal Kent is Kayser Soze, that chick is really a dude, Darth is Luke's father and the Maltese Falcon is a fake.""It is a betrayel of trust to ruin the season before it begins.Buy the season. Watch it. Just remember to leave the room after you put each disk in the dvd player, and stay out until the menu is active."
2,Great recording!,"This is a great recording! Modern instruments; recorded in 1977, and there are 2 discs in the set, not just 1 like the information page says."
2,The best book there is,"I think that I've been looking through all of the current books on directory service architecture and planning. And I'm confident that this is the best book there is at present. While two of the 20 chapters in the book do include a few examples that may seem a bit dated due to them being based on RC1, this really doesn't mean anything to anyone, but the people that might be under the false impression that this book also will tell them how to configure and install Windows 2000 Server. Anyway, whatever way you may see things, the 670 pages (which by the way is far more than what you'll find elsewhere) is just what you'll need to understand and plan for Active Directory. So until a better book might come along, I'll keep this one handy."
2,nice story I sent it on to my grandchildren,great story and quality of CD was like new. I was proud to send it on to my grandchildren. Thanks
1,Plug and Play LOL!,"No where in the item description did it mention or say anything about this plug and play only working on older tv's and vcr's. I have an LCD tv but not until I tried and put it together and turn it on did it say, ""DOES NOT WORK WITH LCD/PLASMA TV'S. Nice to know after you bought it, tried to use it and then it does nothing. A total waist of time. It porbably is an awesome game and all but I will never know."
2,Wonderful and entertaining,Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are just great together. Bought this for my granddaughters and they have enjoyed watching it along with their grandparents. A good clean family movie.
2,Excellent product,"I've had this mug for three years and am very pleased with it. It holds a normal sized cup of coffee or tea, and you can completely seal it and toss it in your briefcase without worry. I like the two piece lid: the bottom part is a sipping lid and the top is a cap that completely seals the mug.There is also an interchangeable teaball cap, which I never use.The only time I've had trouble is if it is overfilled. There is a fill line on the inside as a guide. If you overfill, the mug will leak, both when drinking or in your bag.Highly recommend this product."
1,not so tough,What happened to this band? What happened to the creative energy that produced fox base alpha and so tough????
2,"Easy to understand, great for learning basic concepts","I read this book twice! It's great for learning the basic relational database concepts. I had been looking for quite some time for something that covered not only database design but work processes as well, and this book fit the bill."
2,Ka Bar mule serrated,"Very pleased with this knife, came pretty sharp, serrations seem good, ergonomics are decent, pocket clip holds nice and low. Black coating on blade (teflon?) comes off to easy. Good knife for the money if you like a bigger folding knife."
1,Not as good as the last one,"This book is a bit of a let down. The main problem I have with it is that there are pages and pages of absolutely nothing happening. This book could have been shortened by about 80 pages. Mary Crow is an interesting character, but really doesn't do anything until the last 40 pages of the book. Her relationship with Jonathan is nothing more than an afterthought. The most interesting characters in the story are the two little girls who figure out what's going on before anyone else does, and they began to annoy me after awhile. Had high hopes for this one, but it just didn't cut it."
1,If you are in a desert island and this the only book you have to read; go fishing,"This book is formulaic to put it politely. Another international intrigue plot, another ""James Bond like"" hero, one dimensional; rich and irresistible to every woman within ten miles from him. Hardy Boys like cliffhangers; and of course the most stupid and retarded set of bad guys in the history of literature!The writing style wants to be groovy and cool and comes out flat annoying.And by the way; people in Brazil speak Portuguese, not Spanish! (just a little detail for you there Mr. Bell)Unreadable"
2,A Very Informative Read,"I have read all books by John Douglas and Mark Olshaker. I recommend them not only because they are an interesting read, but because they are on subjects that people need to be more aware of. In ""Obsession,"" a main focus is on the different types of rapists. The authors inform us about how to keep yourself safe and how to defend yourself against them. I think this book needs to be read by any woman who wishes to learn ways to protect herself. The more informed you are, the more of a chance you have. I would recommend this book to anyone as a must read."
1,Hope your DVD is better than ours,I purchased this DVD for X-mas and when played it is very dark. It is so dark. We have tried it on different TVs. Hope you get a better copy. Oh yeah the movie is still a classic.
2,Trans-sister radio,Very interesting and informative. Gives an emotional side of a transexual experience. The novel involves all the persons connected with the transexual and how the change affects them.
1,Doesn't reduce redness,"Even though this cleanser felt great on my face, it didn't reduce redness at all. That was my purpose for buying this product. I'll stick to my Dove."
1,Hose will have to be replaced,"At first everything was fine, reel works as advertise and I really liked it. But at last the hose is cracking and I got a hole near the end of it this weekend. After looking some more, there are a lot of cracks in the hose, so yes it will have to be replaced.It appears like this is a common problem looking at the other comments left so far. So I can re-confirm the hose will not last - only used it maybe 20 times or so."
1,disappointed...,I was disappointed when receiving this book. It was filled with ink written remarks and lines all through the book. It is very distracting when reading the book and should have been noted when selling.
2,Good value for themoney,"Pots work well &a re easy to use. Reasonable price,too. The brushed metallic surface does show watermarks & splodges, but is easily wiped down."
1,What a piece of SH*T,"Are you kidding me?!! NAS sold out as a rapper, appearing with Puff Daddy. What a joke he is. I have no respect for him anymore. DMX has no lyrical ability and he never did. His music is boring,and is definetly not stimulating. Hype Williams should stick to making music videos because he has no capacity for a story. The funny thing is, the lack of ability that these guys have musically is doubled when it comes to the film. Nas and Dmx ARE TERRIBLE ACTORS."
1,Would have been great...,"I bought this adapter to run component video from my ATI HD 2600 card to my tv. Plugged it in and got picture; but the color was all off. After playing around a bit I found the problem was that the blue component out was not sending out a signal. If you get one where all the connections work, I think it would work great. It sends an HD component signal from the 9-pin S-video port on ATI cards to the TV."
2,May the pseudo scientists keep quiet,"After reading over a hundred UFO books, this is the first one explaining how anti-gravity works. A real scientist chastises the [people] hiding behind Einstein their misunderstanding of the relation between interstellar travel and the speed of light. A book to placate the traditional morons who want to exhibit their meager knowledge at the expense of truth. On page 319, Hill states that he had avanced knowledge on UFOs but that Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, director of NACA muzzled him with specific directives."
1,hurts your finger while you push the button,"I do not know what those guys were thinking, but did you notice a bump right in the meedle of the push button? Yes, there is a bump, and it is quite pointy and sharp. Now imagine pushing this button for any time, and you have to really push it hard for this blender to work, and push it for quite long, because the blender is weak, and you will really need a lot of time to get results. And all this time this pointy bump cuts into your finger! it is torture! I got this blender as a gift, or I would send it back. Also, you cannot remove the moving part to wash it, so you have to balance the whole thing while washing, so it will not fall in the water and be ruined."
2,HD-DVD Final Cut review,"This is a review of the HD-DVD Blade Runner Final Cut only. To put it in prospective I have the Laser Disk and the Director's Cut on DVD.If you have an upscaling DVD player then there is not too much visual improvement to the orginal Director's Cut DVD. What has really improved is the Dolby 5.1 sound. The improvement in the sound quality in the regular Director's Cut to a HD-DVD,Blu-Ray, Regular DVD Final Cut is great.The opening scene when the ships pass over the city, first from front to back L, then from back to front,R, are grealty improved in rear sound quality.Your ears will feel the diference."
2,Lots of pirate adventures set in Asia,"This is one of those books you don't want to put down. Great story that spans the life of its hero Dirk Struan. I can picture Sean Connrey playing Struans role in a movie. He would be the perfect Scottish ships captain. If there could be any criticism of this book, it would be that Struan is too strong of a character. He always out fights, out smarts, and has all the women attracted to him. The author introduces some unique pigeon allowing the characters of different cultures to communicate. It was also worth noting at while the British (and other Europeans) look down on the Chinese for their lack of sophistication and strange cultural practices, the Chinese saw them as barbarians. Of course our hero Struan was wise enough to listen, test, then adopt some of the Chinese practices. This was a great story and setting, I'm anxious to read some of the Clavell's other books."
2,Back Pain Relief,"I received my Bed Wedge in just 3 days. It is durable,comes with a washable cover, and really helps relieve back discomfort. The wedge keeps it shape, and does not slide around the bed during sleep. I checked prices at specialty stores, and found the Duro-Med to be half the cost. I highly recommend this product."
1,Nothing,I really wanted to like this product since they do not test on animals but after a little over a month I have to admit the product is bogus. It doesn't do anything at all to improve the look or texture of skin. I tried and it cost a pretty penny too.
1,Not very happy,"First of all, I ordered the BR 50. This is what the description says and this is what the picture shows. What came in the mail? BR 56. It looks the same, so I popped it into my phone. It works, BUT it does not hold a charge any better than my three year old battery that I was trying to replace. I'm not very happy, but too busy to mess with trying to get this problem fixed for the amouont of money that I'm out. It's just very annoying."
1,nearly $90.00 for the CD?This is Highway Robbery!,"I imagine this CD is fantastic in every way except the price.Is this a trend in the offing>Will we now see CD sellers scalping potential customers with outrageous prices?I might pay up to thirty bucks and I would also need to preview the tunes.I know,(a shrug of shoulders) and the reply,""Whatever the market will bear...""Is Amazon also selling it?I wonder?"
2,If your a Goofball like me you will luv this comedy,"I realize that not everyone has a corny type of sense of humor like I do where you find silly movies like naked gun or nacho libre just full of laughs ..And Im not the type to rank movies but if you like those type of comedies im sure you will love weekend at bernies ..i literly couldnt stop laughing ..the plot, the scheming is so far out there it truly has 90 min of laughs and its a really enjoyable movie ..I dont usally buy movies anymore but I had to on this one..bottom line either way buy or rent it its a must see """
2,One of my Favorites,"This book was not at all what I expected. I am a huge fan of Emily Giffin books and one of my favorites is ""Something Borrowed."" ""How I Stole Her Husband"" is much like ""Something Borrowed"" in that it will have you rooting for the underdog. I couldn't put this book down!"
1,Good music trivialised by poor performance.,"I've read some of the recent reviews here and I found it absurd that some keep on saying that Russell Watson is a talented singer who delivers ""opera"" well.Has Russell Watson ever sung opera? Is his kind of singing operatic? I seems that certain fans of the singer just can't (and won't) appreciate some basic facts.In my opinion, this cd is an embarrassment to the singer. Not only does it reveals Russell Watson is poor voice (actually, worse than that displayed in his first album), it shows how good or even great music can be trivialised by poor performances.What a waste..."
1,Dissapointed in Amazon - NOT ORIGINAL DISC!,"CAUTION - THIS IS NOT AN ORIGINAL DISC! They send you a crappy loooking case (not original one) there is no information in the disc booklet (other than a song list), and the CD is a CDR. No 1/2 naked shot of Herbie on the cover! BOOOOOOOO to Amazon!The music is great - Amazon sales and disclosure - not so much."
1,Terrible,How annoying is this CD?!?! I bought it before a trip to Key West and prayed this guy wasn't playing at any bars I would be going to. Vocals and writing are the some of the worst I've heard. How did this ever get produced???
2,More than smooth... it's a groove!!,"Nice to hear some contemporary ""groove jazz"" from somebody who is NOT from New York or L. A. These guys are strong.. the cover of ""Memphis Underground"" is a really nice take on an old Herbie Mann tune. Would like to hear them perhaps branch a bit further away from the Russ Freeman/Rippingtons thing and do something maybe a bit more ""Memphis."" The only criticism: I have heard them live, and the CD sounds a bit ""studio"" compared to the high-energy live sound they generate. This is probably the most meaningful release from a Memphis artist or group in well over 10 years.Memphis has a few ""secrets"" like this, that don't get much recognition because they are not based on the coasts, and hopefully Voodoo Village will be one of the bands to change that. (For those who don't live in Memphis- the name comes from an Indian artifact village that is actually tucked away in a very unlikely portion of the city.)"
2,I would give it 10 stars if I could!,"This book was absolutely incredible. I was completely wrapped up in it halfway through the first paragraph! Although this book was quite long I read it in four days... I couldn't put it down! I would also like to point out to whoever wrote the Kirkus Review that they should watch their spelling: Liwellan and Feiran are the correct spellings. I couldn't believe how harshly ""Exiles"" was reviewed by Kirkus; the book was a fantastic read and I have re-read it at least fifteen times. I recommend it to anyone!"
2,great book,"i was sick and read this book for two days straight and finished it. i am a fast reader though. anywho its a fun read, deffinatly not stiff. the writer makes you think as well as smile. i would recommend this book to anyone that is in or wants to be in a relationship."
1,no not quite good as it seems,its very portable but its just too dang blurry when u take the pictures. and the camera feels like it wont last more than 6 months of use with it
2,18 months,I purchased this book for my 18 month old son. He loves to open the special doors. Open the barn door is a sweet book and stands up to my son's not so gentle approach to reading. The doors are a little tough to open for him alone as they stick. But it holds up quite well.
2,Best Bet,"I bought this book after trying to study for the PPST using Barron's Study Guide for PRAXIS (4th edition). The Kaplan book is far better than Barron's-it's like night and day! I'm taking the PPST tomorrow, and I feel confident that I'll do well. Kaplan's book also gives tips and tricks how to answer a question even when you don't know the answer, and they also clue you in to any ""traps"" the PPST is known for. I highly reccomend this book!"
2,"A Great Buy, for a Mac User.","I bought this Logitech mouse because I received a new Apple computer. As we all know, Apple ships with a standard one-button mouse, which is not ideal for those who have become accustomed two- or three-button mice. Once I received the mouse in the mail, I plugged it in to my computer's USB port and instantly it worked - no drivers to install, nothing. The mouse's controls worked seamlessly and fluidly, right clicking and scrolling documents went fine. I have had this specific mouse for two years, and have experienced no problems. Logitech's mouse delivers, and for a cheap price too.. buy it!"
1,Rip off,I am so disappointed that I already bought the turbo twist math for my 6 year old. I Think that he would really love to play with it but I can't believe that when I went to order the spelling one I saw the mind station and read about it. How unfair it is to charge a monthly fee for an already expensive toy. Kids need to learn exactly these things but I can't afford to pay a monthly service. So I guess I will be returning the turbo twist math. Bummer!!!!!!!!
1,Overpriced,There is more writing in the description than in the entire book. Written at a pre-K level. Overcharged for the size of the book and value
1,"The worse movie since ""The English Patient.""",I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie. This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-(
2,LMT,An excellent resource book for development and function of the nervous system. Written in an easy to understand language with great illustrations to accompany otherwise complex functions within the human body.
2,Good but surprised,I bought this press for a family member who lives in Africa who often does not have electricity to run the coffeemaker. He will be able to use this when he can only heat water by gas. He says it works well but he was surprised that he could only get 2 mugs of coffee on one brew because of the amount of foam that seems to build when you add the water. I don't have any experience with coffee presses but maybe this info will help someone else.
1,Dig a Big Pit,"At last a Jam album to pretty much avoid, 'Dig the New Breed' is horror versions of your favourite Jam songs played lacklustre fashion in venues like Hammersmith Palais and Edinburgh Playhouse.Imagine listening to fuzzy, out of tune interpretations with a bit of muffled crowd roar and an aeroplane starting up in the back of the hangar and you've got 'Dig the New Breed'.An appallingly condescending selection; singles, couple tracks from each album, one 'exclusive' song - a cover version of 'Big Bird' (No? Me neither) so the completists need buy it. All bases covered in relentlessly avaricious and insultingly contrived fashion.So how about it pop-kids - come and get your souvenir live Jam album to commemorate the lousy farewell tour.Sound much like Weller?"
2,They Lock,"They lock, I use a key to open them and they lock. Exceptional concept for keeping your Thule just barely secure."
2,Fantastic album,"Dio keeps putting out excellent albums. This is his 8e album I thought and it is still great! I also like the story at the end, that story makes this album very interesting. Ronnie James is in good vocal condition and the rest of the band is also very good. When this album came out I hoped for something like Strange Highways or Angry Machines, but I think this album is even better then those masterpieces, keep at the good work, Ronnie!And for the ones who read this review, BUY THIS ALBUM, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!1"
1,Diapers,"I don't like anything about these diapers. My baby always had a rash due to the urine touching the skin. They don't wick the moisture away from the babies skin. The diaper is so bulking, my baby couldn't wear pants. Touching the inside of the soiled diaper could not be avoided. The bowel movements don't stay in the diaper. I had to throw them away."
2,It makes me wonder,"This, throughout my time of living, has got to be the best book that I have ever read. I was was stuck on the gracious, utterly remarkable aspects of the story, and it made me think of a better life not yet lived by myself. Truly, a step in literature where competion against it would have fall short of a miracle in order to compare to its greatly credible teachings."
2,This pool is a hit!,My 4 year old and 2 year old boys both loved this pool. They absolutely love the boogie board and the water slide. Setup was fairly easy but I do suggest an electric air pump (it takes a lot of muscle to use a manual pump to inflate it!!).It is a great value for the price. I would definitely recommend it.
1,A clear look at Islam,A good resource to take you behind all the headlines and propaganda to the heart of Islam. The book is a thorough and clear presentation for those of us who know little about Islam. Plainly written and easy to search.
1,Cogna,"Rall. Pichau, pichau. Cogna fiber rasta murden. Calatráqueo randalishi mirmicaro Sotoponcio. Agrara ekklaba tumura.Sei di fillin humbulache ö Polio tonoporo u, al tag nachana nach alabanca.mistralapu Pinchu, örnofolio hur tomonolio Pocno. Freca.Sitedo prenelio. Urtubunchu."
1,not impressed,"Not easy to put together. wanted more of a large picture frame. that's not what this is. i would've returned it, but for $8, not worth the hassle to ship it back."
1,"Looks pretty, function is ugly","The good:Looks amazing. People tend to comment about them when they see em.The Bad:the guts are all plastic, with no way to adjust between course and fine. It does not make sense to me because I bought the brass version of this at the same time and it is a completely different product inside - metal guts, adjustable, solid.I bought the brass one for salt, and the copper one for pepper, I have them reversed now because the copper one cant handle the pepper."
1,Mind Numbingly Boring and Elementary,"I used this text for a university general education requirement. Unfortunately, I had already learned how to read graphs in grade school. The chi-squared test introduced almost last in the text is taught the during the first week in any genetics course. This is a book not worthy to be purchased and I hope college professors avoid this text."
1,Baseball Music Review,Was looking for music to play at Baseball Month at a event of senior citizens. Did not have the standard traditional music you would expect from this selection. Music is modern perhaps very young folks might enjoy it. I bought the Ken Burns Soundtracks and that had the traditional baseball music and the event people loved it.
2,The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever...,"This is a stupendous, scientific book that every doctor should be aware of and apply to their practice. If they did it would change, for the better, the face of modern American medicine in both style and substance. This study proves that what we eat determines the health of our body. We are what we eat. Eat well (plant-based) and you'll be free of disease. Eat the typical/normal/usual American diet and your life will be plagued with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc., etc. The book is easily read by any adult looking for the science to change their eating habits for the better. I also recommend you watch the Forks Over Knives DVD and read the Forks Over Knives book and Cookbook, as well as Dr. Caldwell B Esselstyn's Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease. They all go hand-in-hand to help people change their lives for the better through food."
2,Works great when you follow directions,This is my second misto. The first one I over filled and it failed. This one I have filled no more than half as directed and it works great.
2,Very chilling,"A stark, short tale of a woman who grew up in a sexually abusive home and how that person reacted to the abuse. There is no fluffy writing here, abuse and behavior is shone in bare-bone snipits and snapshots, including self-blame and acting out."
1,Not at all what I expected,"No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended."
2,Great Ear Buds,Finally ear buds that will stay in my ears when I hike. Plenty of choices when it comes to tips. I did the 48 hour break-in and they sound phenomenal. I bought a second pair for my wife.
2,this brand rules,I love their products though I've heard their wooden pencils aren't as awesome as they used to be.and now a bunch of random words because amazon's a douche:hey yo hi whats up how goes it? go art it rules forever but drawing is boring.
2,Repetition pt. 4,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen.Slates is great fun...but i'm wondering why it has been released seperately from the A Part Of America Therein, 1981 album. just to make room for bonus tracks? hmmm..."
1,They DON'T get better,"Okay, I think Sandry's book wasn't good, but I kept reading the series, hoping the next was better. Tris's book might have been actually WORSE!!! I am SO dissappointed in Tamora Pierce. She could do a MUCH better job (example: Alanna, Daine, etc, etc). The characters were lacking and the plot was....I'm saying this in the nicest way possible for me....DROP DEAD BORING!!!!!!!! I'm not going to waste anymore time on this series. Goodbye!"
1,Use A Brick!,"The 'pillow' doesn't stay put, and isn't tall enough (2"") for most people. When filling with water most comes out when you TRY to close/seal the valve. DON'T waste your money. I am going to throw this out and pay $60 for a usable hot tub 'brick' which gives 4"" of height and allows the addition of pea gravel or other high density material to prevent floatation. Suction cups are equally useless, as many hot tubs are textured and prevent adhesion."
2,So amazing.,"I was one of the lucky few who got to see this video when it was first premiered in select theaters. I was hesitant to attend because I had no idea what to expect and didn't want my love for FOO to be lessened... but it was INCREDIBLE! It made me love them even more... a hundred times more! I'm comfortable saying that even people who aren't fans of their music will still love this video... it's humorous, emotional, captivating, and uplifting... and best of all it's a true story! It really allows you to have an intimate connection with Foo... I feel like I grew up with them now! I suggest checking it out.. now!"
2,stylish diva,mariah carey is one of the stylish diva that carry off her music well and dresses well!after tonight and thank god i found you is sure great hits!
2,Honeywell HEPA filter #21500 works great,Product fits and works great. The new filters from the manufacturer are now smaller so you need to stack two of them to fit in my air purifier. But this brand is just the right size!
2,Are you worried by high cholesterol?,"Then read this book! It answers a lot of questions -- Exactly what is high cholesterol? Science doesn't know. -- Since the body manufactures cholesterol, what is the purpose of cholesterol? Science doesn't know. -- What happens to the body if cholesterol is lowered? Science doesn't know. Dr. Ravnskov quotes many sources and has done his research well in his attempt to point out that medical science doesn't know all the doctors think they know on the subject. Read this book then question your doctor -- I intend to...."
2,Another great story by Modesitt,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was the continuation of the story about Kharl the cooper. The book flows well and kept me interested in every chapter.The publisher needs a rather large kick in the back side for the grammer, spelling and punctuation mistakes in the book. Very disapointing to see work from a top class story teller be adulterated in such a way.The story is part of the Recluse series, so anyone who reads this series will love it. Glad I started reading these books again."
1,Unimpressed,"I was looking for a fan with a stronger air flow than my basic 20"" Lasko box fan. I looked around and saw the Lasko 3300 and thought it looked like it would fit the bill. When I got home I plugged it in and did a side by side comparison with my old box fan. I was surprised to find that there was no difference between the two. It's back in the box to be returned. I ended up purchasing a Honeywell Turbo Force medium size fan and it is a much better fit for me. It provides a much better air flow and takes up far less space. If I could afford it I would have purchased a Vornado as I have a friend that has a couple of different styles and they are awesome, but the Honeywell is a good second choice."
1,PRICE IS OVER PRICED!!! ITS 34 at target.,34 at target but if you have to travel to buy it and then the tax it might be worth the convenience.
2,An Award-Winning Score,"This soundtrack....absolutely amazing. Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer are both geniuses and DESERVE an oscar. I recently stopped by www.ocsarwatch.com to see if POTC would be a possibity for score. Disappointed, I didn't see it there!! Instead, they have FINDING NEMO, THE MISSING, and this COLD MOUNTIAN movie...IS THAT NOT SICK?? I was close to tears!!! Tell me you cannot believe that!! I am telling you, if pirates does not even get nominated for music, I WILL FIND WHOEVER MAKES THESE OSCAR DECISIONS AND PERSONALLY AND PAINFULLY MAKE THEM HEAR THIS AWESOME SOUNDTRACK UNTIL THEY GET IT THROUGH THEIR FAT AND UGLY HEADS THAT PIRATES RULES ALL!!!! *breathes*Like I said...there's no REAL soundtrack that as can match the Pirate's."
2,My dog loves this toy!,"This toy made our Christmas. It was so fun watching our dog enjoy it. He loves the squirrels, but even after he has dug them out he still enjoys the ""tree."" He's had this for a week and not tired of it. The toy keeps him thinking and active. I have recommended to so many friends and family. All parts are very high quality."
1,errrr.,Fu*k this discrace to NIN fu*k it right up it's stupid ass.BTW I like half th bands on here.....or used to.
2,My favorite Deep Forest cd!,"The standard US version of this release is mysteriously OUT OF PRINT for some reason! However, this is an import version titled ""World mix"" with different cover artwork and bonus mixes and therefore is an essential item for those who cannot get a hold of a copy of the original Deep Forest albumDeep Forest came around shortly after the huge success of Enigma who combined Gregorian chants to ambient dance rhythms. Deep Forest came up with a similar concept except it was to mix Pygmy/African vocal samples with dance rhythms creating a sound all it's own. While the following Deep Forest cds have been great as well, none of them have matched the qualities and beauty found on this release and therefore it is among one of most essentials albums of the progressive world music genres of all time."
2,Like a fine wine,"Just like a fine wine, Paul Rogers gets better with age. This performance makes the original CD's sound amateur. If you can sit still while watching this you'd better check and see if you have a pulse. I put it the catagory with ""No Quarter"" and ""40 Licks"" I was playing it rather loud one morning (as usual), my cell starts ringing, I see it's my neighbor calling and think ""Oh Boy, she's mad. Answered the phone and heard three words, ""Crank it up!"""
2,WORKS GREAT!,"after countless failures of cordless phones, I went with a name that puts out quality. This phone is simple, sounds great, and has a great design."
2,Great item,Great item. Item was just as described! Would buy again. Do recommend ! Book is very informative. Detailed diagnosis with care plans.
2,Just what I wanted,I was waiting for some time to buy this (for myself) I like how easy it is to read and the size/design.
1,Poor Quality,When I received the scarf the wrong color was sent - drab green instead of the black I ordered. The company said they were out of black so they just sent another color. The quality was not good - the seams were poorly sewn - looked very ragged and uneven. It was a rather involved process to try to return it to the company and I eventually had to get Amazon involved. Amazon acted very quickly and they were able to resolve the situation. I would not order anything from this company again.
2,"Well, at least my step daughter loved it...","I bought this game for my step daughter for her birthday. When she opened the package, she screamed and jumped for joy. She loves the game but gets bored after playing it for hours."
2,This Book Was Written By A Kid,"Before you read THE NEON BIBLE, realize that the author was about 16 or so (maybe younger!) when he wrote this book. Then, after you've finished contemplate that fact once again... You'll be dumbfounded!ps. This book is a quick read."
1,"just received my sony walkman, however.......","I just received this walkman, but cannot get the sound to play from any of my CDs. The digital display seems to be working, but no sound. Also, I cannot get any sound from any of the radio stations. I have read and reread the directions. Is there something I'm not doing, or have I received a faulty item?"
2,My favorite poet,"I'm not sure what the other reader was reading, but I think he missed the point.Ray Bradbury is one of the best poets I have ever read"
2,sand table,"My children love this table, it's sturdy and comes with a wonderful umbrella that wards off the heat on super hot days. When not in use, it also has a great lid to cover the entire table. Its fun, easy clean-up, doesn't take up much space and besides the great educational value of this table, its natural look blends in nicely with the backyard."
2,"Fullness, Balance, and Challenge","As if attending a crusade event in person, the reader will find the always compassionate, passionate, and caring Billy Graham pleading for unbelievers to believe, believers to come to the fullness promised to them as children of God, and for those needing clarity on this important subject to hit THE BOOK and discover through the Holy Spirit what they need. As I read, I kept thinking, ""I miss Dr. Graham."" Then, I turned on the TV and one of his ""classic"" crusade presentations was on a religious channel. You sometimes forget what a great teacher, preacher, evangelist and pastor he was.GREAT, GREAT book that will bless, challenge, and inspire you to reach higher in your walk with the Lord."
1,Forget the PDA compatibility,"I first bought version 8.0 of this software, only to find that it didn't work on my LifeDrive Palm. It wasn't easy to get hold of technical support, but after about 2 weeks and a lot of going round they told me that this product does not work with OS 5.4. It would have been nice to know this before I purchased it, because being able to export shopping lists and recipes to my Palm was the main reason I purchased this particular software. I bought version 9.0 and found that the problem still has not been corrected."
2,Practical Articles,"This is a relative young magazine and still evolving. It has great articles for beginning to intermediate potters with a few advanced articles too. PMI presents more ""how to"" and practicle articles than CM and Clay Times. Good tips for most people working with clay."

1,OK until it broke,"I bought a Casio PX-110 as a Christmas present for my 15 year old grandson who was learing to play the piano. After 10 months of careful use a single key stopped functioning correctly. I had the credit card receipt for the purchase, but not the original sales receipt. I sent Casio the paperwork I had plus a notarized letter on the circumstances of the purchase, per their request. Casio says they didn't receive the documents and would not repair it under warranty. They wanted to charge me $257.00 to repair one key, which I declined to do, fearing another key would break, and bought a Yamaha keyboard instead. I feel that it is a serious quality problem when a keyboard breaks in less than a year, and a design problem when it costs over $250 to reair a simple problem."
2,"Thanks to this book, I scored 966 on my exam...",This book has lots of errors due to bad publishing. But It did help me to score so high on my 70-67 exam. I made only one mistake. I am still in shock. After some 500 questions I was ready. Most of errors in this book were obvious. I corrected most of them for myself of course...
1,What an incredible letdown!!!,"At first I was unable to put this book down. The intriguing beginning piqued my interest, and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened. Sloan's style of writing is very skillful and her artistry is outstanding ... therefore, my question is, how come she began a book with such potential and promise and then proceeded to force on her readers such a disappointing ending? It's a shame, because the book had so much potential. Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness. Her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better. I only recommend this book if the reader stops after the first half; it's better to make up your own ending than accept the author's."
2,Bridesmaids,"This movie won lots of awards---which is highly unusual forcomedies!! And, it was a funny movie. Many of the actressesare from SNL...but my personal favorite is Melissa McCarthy [Mikeand Molly--TV show].If you enjoy funny movies, as I do, you might want to purchasethis one."
2,"DELICIOUS and great, great , great, great , great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","i have not gotten a cold or flu ever since ive been taking this, best way: fresh banana, vanilia extract, cinammon, ice, soy milk, truvia sweetner and i use 6 scoops!!-becuase the product quality is superb!!and it tastes super good delicious...also i use strawberrys-organic minus-extract-cinammon and extra truvia,also delicious."
1,Forest Lords,"There are no dungeons in ""Dungeon"" LOrds. Although NPS will talk about it. They haven't been implimented in yet! I was going to rate this 3 stars until I found out how rude customer support can be to people. Downright smart-elicky. Someone reported that when he called about the lack of appearence change in this game they just said. ""Well that's not important to us now is it."" That is a perfect example of the big company with a big head. The game it'self is fun enough but you'll be disappointed to know that you cannot solve it! The objective is missing! Not to mention all the dungeons. What you do get is a lot of skills(which is a good thing if they work) but the don't. It makes little difference if you have a 1 or a 5 in your large shield because it is just a number and nothing more. my fighter moves no faster with a 1 in everything(except wheapons) or a 5. That stinks! And so does this!"
1,"No audible signal, can't switch it off","Despite the claim that this kettle has an audible signal, I watched it at full boil for five minutes with no signal. Maybe it waits until the water temperature is 212 F? If so, that doesn't do me much good at an altitude of 6800 feet, where water boils below 200 F. Just give me an old-fashioned whistle!Despite the presence of what appeared to be an on-off switch, pressing the switch did not turn the kettle off. I had to unplug it from the wall.The indicator light did come on after I turned it on. And it did boil water.I decided not to test its claimed auto-off feature if it overheats. I'm returning it Monday."
1,"Poor product, terrible support","I constantly lose connection with this card while my other Belkin card stays connected. Eventually I decided to get rid of this card and get another Belkin. Funny thing happened! The linksys card can't be uninstalled and it prevents the belkin card from being installed. Nothing happens after I run the uninstaller.I had to call them. They said they would send me a registry cleaner via email. It never arrived, even though they made repeated promises. I had to make numerous calls and wait in long line to get connected.I also had bad experiences with a Linksys router. I will never buy a linksys product.Update: I called them again and again. Finally I was told there was in fact no such cleaner for this model!"
2,Daughter Loved It!,"I got this for my daughter. She was reading it for a class assignment, and read it AFTER the movie. She liked it better. Isn't that almost always the case? That's all I have. Considering the movie was great in my opinion, if the book is better, it's gotta be fantastic!"
2,BEST 'Planet of the Apes' Film,"This movie was by far the best and most worthwhile film in the entire ""Planet of the Apes"" series! I absolutely loved it! Caesar is played by the same actor who played Gholam in the 'Lord of the Rings' films and he is awe inspiring in this film.This movie was well written and well acted. I loved it because the primates were computer generated and it was completely believable. THANK YOU FOR NOT USING REAL ANIMALS!!!!!!This movie also had great respect for animals - primates in particular - and showcased the horrendous things humans do to them, such as animal testing. I was so engrossed in this movie and found myself shouting out loud and screaming into my pillow. Very well done.Bravo!Caesar is one of my ultimate heroes!!!!!!!!"
1,Blown 2 motors already,"I'll start positive...I loved the features and power of this blower. So far each unit I've had was great for about 2 months of heavy leaf season......then flames, smoke, and boom -- dead motor. Twice. Since the fan/vac is just hard plastic, if you suck up a small piece of mulch or too many sweet gum balls it just can't handle it. And if you're like me, you think there's a way to avoid it, but it's just too difficult. There's just no way to keep those things out of your leaf piles.I wonder what I should get now... I'm hooked on the leaf/mulcher concept... if only they'd last more than a season!"
1,Solid effort from Sarah...but a letdown,"I loved Surfacing, so I really looked forward to Sarah's new release, especially given the six years between Surfacing and Afterglow. My first impression is that Afterglow is good, but forgettable. Afterglow does not have the originality, hit songs, or great arranging found on Surfacing. I'm dissapointed because I wanted to be blown away by a great recording, but Afterglow is no more than good. My biggest complaint: The tracks lack diversity and creativity compared to what we know she can do. Her lyric writing also is not as good in comparision to previous CDs. I feel Afterglow lacks the creative spark that typifies her great songs of the past."
1,Warning . .,"Do not watch this movie while operating heavy machinery as it tends to make you nod off. Definitely one of the lesser forms of filmmaking and not historically accurate from any point of view, which makes it's reason for being an inconclusive mystery. If it were on the comic edge it might of helped, but the take is a serious nature on a ridiculous premise."
2,Excellent,I loved this dvd so much I decided to get the special edition dvd with extra footage. This is one that I will watch over and over.
2,His first album; a stroke of genius,"Dave and his crew before the influence of being on a major label set in. A mastefully written, upbeat album. Hardcore Dave fans will get the most enjoyment out of this one, but for the more mainstream fans, favorites from ""Under the Table"" and ""Crash"" such as ""Ants Marching"", ""Satellite"", and ""Tripping Billies"" are live on this album."
1,POOR QUALITY PRODUCT-DO NOT BUY,Item was poorly constructed of cheap materials and looks far better in the photo than what arrived. It is comprised of a very thin metal sheet over plastic and is quite disappointing. It takes a long time to unscrew the top ball and it sits crooked when fully screwed in. The smaller pole leans and is also crooked. I had a similar product in the past that was actually made of quality stainless steel. It was heavier and a better product. This product is a waste of money and a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I should have returned it. DO NOT BUY IT.
1,FLORIDA,"THE NEXT GENERATION REMOTE CONTROL EXTENDER MAY WORK, BUT I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT WORK ON ANY OF MY DIRECTV HD21 REMOTES. RETURNED ITEM TO SELLER NOW WAITING FOR A REFUND. CONTACTED SELLER AND THEY EMAILED ME WITH ADDRESS TO WHERE TO RETURN ITEM. RETURNED ON AUGUST 21TH, STILL NO REFUND."
1,An Empire Divided is an Apt Sub-title,"Unfortunately, the division is between the cash paying customers, and the Sony / Lucas arts Bean Counters. I have been playing, and I cancelled my account as of last night, due to absolutely no customer service.There are many bugs and problems with this game, which is based on Star Wars only in licensing the names and sounds. Perhaps, if they actually finished beta, and released something that was 75 or 85% functional, it would be worth a glance at, but as it is, you are paying for no service, a great deal of boredom, a broken economy, broken gameplay, and very little to do with actual Star Wars.Two thumbs down"
2,It is what it is,"I bought this for my centurion 39 ak 47. The scope is not bad, it holds up to rapid fire and is accurate within about 50 yards. The red dot is very visible even in direct sunlight. I would say stay within 50 yards though because the dot is pretty large. All in all a good scope for the price. But your not gonna pull off record breaking shots with it."
2,Proctor-Silex has ruled since my mom ruled the kitchen,"Bought this as a replacement for a model my wife picked up at a local retailer. That one did not produce the results one would expect, so I thought we would go with a brand-name that has been around since I was a kid.GOOD choice. . had company over the week it arrived and it is simple to use and the waffles were GREAT !! EASY to clean, also"
1,"poor lit, poor fantasy","The book is readable but is no where near on par with McCarthy's The Road or even less so with Lessing's Mara and Dann. I found it kind of a hodgepodge of silly stories too fantastical to be good fantasy. I didn't like the religious overtones. There are too many demons, elves and fairies and such introduced as if the author is having a hard time figuring out what to write about next... There are a number of grammatical, even spelling errors, too. There is much better fantasy literature, and literature out there. I won't read any more Terry Brooks. Waste of time."
2,Great Dress,I love this dress. Bought it to go on a cruise. It is so comfortable and almost wrinkle free after being packed. Fits perfect.
1,Not,Not the product pictured. You end up getting the orange bottle. I contacted St. Ives directly and they stopped selling the blue bottle over a year ago. This seller should really update their website.
2,Convenient and fun,The hoop is very easy to put together and take apart. The dvd is simple and somewhat fun. I wish it involved more tricks you could do with the hoop. The only thing I wish the kit came with was a bag or something you can carry your hoop pieces in. Other than that it's a great deal for only $30 bucks.
2,Great album,I got this as a gift for someone and ended up making a backup for myself. Really enjoyed it. Also service was fast and efficient
2,Perfect replacement,"I ordered this battery hoping it would fit and work in my JVC camcorder. I recieved it ahead of estimated date, it looks identical, fit perfectly and most important, it holds a charge. My old battery would only work for about 5 mins. Now I'm back to about an hour. Great buy and works perfectly for an non-OEM battery. I recommend this product."
1,terrible guide book,not nearly enough picsonly 3 pages on Ranier which is what I was really interested in.Maps are very rudimentary
1,This garbage can is GARBAGE,"Length:: 1:07 MinsLook - this thing doesn't work anymore. This claim, ""if you open your can 20 times a day, it can last over 10 years. This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time."" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product."
2,"Love it, except for the parts they cut out","I agree with everyone who said they cut out parts of the 3 straight to DVD release episodes, which were Trouble On Planet Wait Your Turn, Cheating Scales of Bullamanka, and The Amazing Carnival of Complaining. If you didn't watch these episodes from their original DVDs, then you would really be confused by some of the editing they did. I wish they would come out with the rest of the episodes. Wikipedia says they have 27 episodes, but with all the DVDs they have out, including the 3 episodes that weren't released on their own DVD but are on this one, the total amount of episodes would be 18. So they need to put the other 9 on DVD! I hope they do that soon!"
1,Derivative; not a new voice,I don't think the problem is so much that the author portrays things in terms of Jewish cliches or jokes; even Jews talk about their own lives in terms of these tropes. More problematic is that someone is our age is writing like Bernard Malamud or Isaac Bashevis Singer.
2,Awesome!,I was a little hesitant to buy this perfume. But trust me it is great. My wife loves it and the female colleage asked which one is it to buy for her husband. :) It stays on till you wash the shirt. :)
2,great stuff,"was still new as stated, good condition, plays perfect, arrived early, nothing but laughs for this product. nothing but compliments from me."
1,Typical razor blade scraper...,"Stanley 28-500 Razor Blade ScraperTwo bucks is about all this tool is worth. It works, but the blade extension mechanism is fair at best and sometimes gets stuck, especially as the tool gets dirty. There isn't anything about this tool that distinguishes it from all the other cheap razor scrapers on the market. My advice is to buy a scraper locally and avoid shipping charges."
1,"Very rough reading, no plot, no dialogue","I appear to be in the minority in my review. Obviously, the author put many hours of work in this, years of research, and had a passion for Hadrian. Maybe I have lowbrow taste, but kept turning the pages waiting for anything to arouse my interest. There were too many names and places with which I was not familiar. I don't have the patience to stop and look up every name or place mentioned. There was no plot, no suspense, and no humor. In short, nothing I could find to make the book readable. It is like reading the encyclopedia. There is plenty of information, but it had no entertainment value for me at all. Reading all of the reviews makes me feel stupid, but all I can do is warn those who are hoping to get some enjoyment from this book. I hope you have better luck with it than I did!"
1,useless and stupid...,Strategy guides are horrible. Why use one ESPECIALLY for DOA3? ITS LIKE A STRATEGY GUIDE FOR PONG!!!!!!!
2,He's Hungry,"Lloyd Banks and G-Unit are the hottest rappers out right now. Shady/Aftermath has the game in a choke hold. The Hunger for More just helps to solidify that. If you don't respect this album, your opinion doesn't really matter cuz you're just hatin' on my man. Solid beats, sick lyrics and punchlines. Who's better than G-Unit right now? No one. Look out for Buck and Game later this summer. G-G-G-G G-UNITTTT...."
1,I hate it .. a lot.,"I really didn't like it at all. It was extremely big on me, and the feather's kept bugging me and they were too big. It also looks really cheap in person."
1,Average for Ozzy,I've always liked Ozzy with or without Black Sabbath.No more tears has mostly ok songs but few stand out as excellent. Mr. Tinkertrain has strange lyrics but is probably the best song on the cd. Hellraiser is a motorhead song featured at the end of Hellraiser 3 and Ozzy's version of it is pretty good. Zombie stomp is interesting and cool sounding. Desire is melodic.The complaints are that No more tears has a weak mixing and mastering production. It doesn't have that rich and resonating heavy sound you hear in a lot of good sounding metal cds. Also you can also tell this was recorded when Ozzy wasn't at his prime. His voice sounds a little bit strained and shot. Zack is great guitarist but he doesn't get to show off his skills too much or too often on this cd. There are also too many cornball ballads on this. .I give no more tears a C+
2,Riveting!,"This is a fast read filled with witty dialogue, clear prose, believable characters, and a charmingly humblehearted narrator-persona. And not without its poignant moments. Some if the chapter endings, in particular, give pause. An example is when Jennifer, in an effort to calm her friend Courtney from her fear of plane-travel, says the view from the plane is like ""the viewpoint of God."" Courtney tells her not to say that, and when Jennifer asks why, Courtney says, ""Because I don't see any people down there."" Hornburg tackles-and more notably, articulates-the larger, timeless, ageless, genderless questions that fill up not only Jennifer and Courtney, but also each and every one of us-one moment with awe, the next moment with terror-as we stare out our ""small plastic window[s], lean forward and look back"" at the complicated, unpredictable roadways of our lives. Hornburg helps us make sense of it all. Bravo!"
2,Downton Abbey What a masterpiece!,"I cannot believe how wonderful this is! The characters have me so captivated I don't want it to end. The family, the downstairs staff, guests, and relatives are completely thrilling!"
1,Deep Purple getting very murky....,The Video Quality on this DVD is very poor....I believe it was not their intent to record this Program. The Sound is PCM Stereo...and the Technical Review here fails to mention it.You might as well have bought an Audio CD !!!! Dont touch it if you value your money
1,RIP OFF!,"What a RIP OFF! I read about the product description and was amazed to find a STONE URN, GRANITE , which weighs 15.2 pounds. And at a great price. It is completely false statement and description. The urns are made of plastic, which bends in many places, weighs one pound, and is not granite, but barely granite looking.The seller MUST change the description, to save other customers from being lead into thinking it is a heavy weight , stone , granite urn. It should clearly mention the material is plastic, and weight is no more than a pound. If I knew that it is going to turn out a light weight plastic, I would never have thought of buying it."
1,"Fancy, cute, and sub-standard","I have a RAZR and find it attractive, thin (which is nice) and unlike some folks find the interface fairly decent.Problems: needs to be restarted every day. In many cases, going from one cell to the next causes the phone to drop reception entirely. Once you make a datebook entry, you can 't edit it. At least I have not yet found a way. Sensitivity stinks to high heaven.After my dismal experience with a StarTac, I doubt I will be a Motorola customer again. Their drop in quality over the years tells me that yet another fine company is headed for the toilet of history. I will go back to Nokia and be done with it."
2,A better Idea 4 U,"I have used Garmin GPS units for two to three years now and the only complaint is the glass mount that comes with the unit after a few uses it Will fall off the windshield especially if the weather is hot.I purchased two of the Garmin Portable Friction mounts and have used them without any problems. I would recommend you purchase one of these when you purchase a Garmin, I'm sure you won't be unhappy with one."
1,Sarah: A Novel,"Barbara Cartland writes The Red Tent. I would put this book in the romantic fiction genre rather than literary. The author attempts to wrap a bodice-ripper in the robes of the Bible in order to ride coat-tails of better written creative fiction based on Biblical characters. Use of sexual words are gratuitous and, even worse, fail at being stimulating. It's a nice story but not gripping. I loved The Red Tent, but did not finish this book."
2,Great Summer Fun,"An enjoyable movie for all comic book fans, and others. I've enjoyed the Fantanstic Four adventures for years. This is one of the few movies that really takes the comic and brings is to the big screen with the same enjoyment I had when reading the adventures of the Fantastic Four.It brought me back to my youth where I would go to the corner drug store to see when a new issue arrived. Not having a penny to my name I would try to read as much as I could before I thought someone would notice.I would recommend this to the young at heart of all ages."
1,Not a dark horse,"""Always the Black Knight"" has some ideas that might have morphed into a good novel, but somehow it fails to happen. The story begins when two knights, Kyning and Deptford, arrive on the remote planet of Elva. They are part of a historical pageant, riding at each other on metal horses with plastic lances. An unfortunate accident leaves Kyning in the hospital, and stranded on Elva after the pageant heads off for the next destination.The remainder of the story follows Kyning as he adjusts to Elva, or rather as Elva adjusts to him. The society is a dystopia of sorts, with mild alcohol and subliminal messages keeping the populace dull and complacent. Kyning introduces his new roommate first to hard liquor, then to classical poetry and jousting. The changes will ripple far beyond their apartment. The story as a whole does not succeed, because the world of Elva never gets any real texture, and the plot is predictable in the extreme."
2,More of an overdrive than a distortion,"I think part of the disappointment in this pedal stems from the fact that it looks like it could be a metal pedal that can give you super scooped mids. It does that job okay but I really would not consider this a distortion in the true sense of the word. It more like an overdrive with not so much character. That's not necessarily a bad thing. My amp is completely soulless but it is pretty damn loud. So basically I define the tone before it hits the amp. You'll probably have to do something similar with this pedal. It does the job of equalization and gain very well but it has very little color to it. I haven't tried it with the Sonic Stomp but I'd imagine that could help. A Screamer of any kind in front of it would definitely help. Or it can be used as a really nice boost pedal. It's not a bad buy and it actually is a quality pedal but it doesn't really have a ""sound"" that you would go after like you would a Tube Screamer or any other decent overdrive."
1,Waiting for the twist that never came.,"I guess I'm numb, but I really couldn't wait to get to the part where you find out that a good character that you trust is actually evil. It never came, but my anticipation got me to the end of the book. I guess I was looking for a twist. There were none, which was especially disappointing considering the subtitle reads, ""True evil has a face you know and a voice you trust.""Aside from that, I have to agree with the folks who complained about product placement. I mean, I was embarrassed for the author, it was so bad. It was frequent enough to significantly cheapen the novel as an art form, in this case.I bought it at the airport, and it got me through a long flight. I guess that's what it's appropriate to expect from an airport novel."
2,Fantastic Story,"This story is about the adventure of Barney and his pals during whom they tried to put the strange egg back to where it landed. Barney and his pals used imagination, such as turning the wood log into aeroplane. This arouses the curiosity of every child, especially my 31 months old son. My son liked it very much. There were many lovely songs presented in the movie, like twinkle twinkle little stars, in which toddlers loved so much."
1,Difficult to Read,"I won't dwell on the inconsistencies and errors in the source code. I won't even go on about the lack of coherent references or explanations of commands and parameters. However, I must warn anyone thinking about picking up this book that they had better be prepared to do some detective work on their own to figure out the author's examples. What should be step-by-step directions that lead to a working product, are instead only partially complete. Some pretty important steps are left out, and I'd say I've had to go back over the chapters at least several times just to figure out what I (and more importantly THE AUTHOR) left out. It's easy to see the inconsistencies in the code listing versus the author's references to it later in the chapter. It's much more difficult to add in what's missing entirely, especially when I'm just learning this myself. I was hoping for much better."
2,Makes the best bread,"This is our favorite gluten free white bread mix. We use it in our breadmaker, and it always comes out perfectly. We use it for sandwiches, and toast. I order this by the case"
2,This book boosted my business.,"I own my own company and often when I was at business events, meetings. meals and the like, I'd find myself stymied by the proper way to handle the etiquette of the situation. From hand-shakes, to introductions, to presenting business cards, I was being tripped up and distracted away from the business at hand. Not any more. This book cleared up those murky waters for me. Now when I walk into business situations I know exactly what's expected of me and what to do about it. With that off my mind I'm completely focused on success."
2,Product is effective but so many pills,"I find that this product is effective at 4 pills 2 times a day. That's a great deal of pills to swallow. I must gulp water to get them down, but the product is effective. I find that the product works best if taken with liquid on an empty stomach, then wait at least an hour before eating. I have not had any issues with my stomach being upset. I went off of the product in August for two weeks after 1 month on and found that I had to get right back on it again. I have slowly taken myself off of it, as directed, and had 'less than even sluggish' events by my own body. Back to the norm, I thought. I will consult with my doctor on that but the product does what it claims. Perhaps the SuperCleanse would require fewer pills."
2,GREAT TRANSACTION,"IT WAS A SMOOTH TRANSACTION, IT IS TERRIFIC HAVING FILTERED WATER. EASY TO REPLACE LESS THAN TWO MINUTE. I BUY ALL GE APPLIANCES WHEN ABLE."
2,WOW,This guy is the extension of Bud - I do not see where his teachings led to true disciples but as an artist he is in the pantheon with the giants.Marsh and Konitz would have made their mark anyway - but as a player - incredible moving and inspiring art.
1,No as spected,"Not as spected, for the almost $100.00, NO a good purchase. Bad in the high frequencies. I did not get a crispy sound.My cellphone (Sony Ericson) that I got for FREE came with a better sound headphones. 30 will be a good price.I do not recommend these headphonesThanks"
2,Two Thumbs Up from a Word Game Buff,"Knowing what a word game buff I am, my sister got this game for me during the holidays and we ended up playing several times together. We once played with up to 14 people, which was something. It doesn't take long to get the hang of it, and the level of difficulty is just right. Deciphering the Scrambles (as the jumbled words and numbers are called) is quite challenging, especially as you are up against the clock. I particularly like the `Names' category (I was the first to solve my husband's name, which actually came up during a game). Two thumbs up for this one."
2,Tarot Art Love,"I love the Fairy Tarot deck! The art takes one back to childhood - all the conversations with fairies and animals, etc. The size of the cards (4 3/4"" X 2 5/8"") make shuffling and handling of the deck easy. Learning the substitute symbols was fairly easy and the Major Arcana is beautiful. The small instruction booklet is rather vague on description and meaning of each card, so another source for meanings is recommended. If you can transport yourself and let your imagination take over, this deck will enchant and amuse you."
1,Needed a better editor,"While I could write a lengthy review, it's easier for me to say that I agreed with the other reviewers who did not enjoy this book. While it was engrossing, it was tough to feel empathy or sympathy for the privileged author. She spent 25 years in a ridiculous relationship, rather than leaving and making a better home and life for herself and her children. Also, the husband had not one redeeming quality. The author portrayed him as a disgusting controlling dictator, and I found myself grossed out more than anything else.Mostly, what I had a problem with was the editing. Many times phrases and ideas were repeated within pages or even paragraphs of each other, while some situations that needed explaining did not get it. It was as if the memoir was edited by someone who was intimately familiar with the author's story, so close to it that they could see past the obvious gaps.Lastly, the epilogue was called a prologue."
2,Top Notch Quality,"I purchased this for a gift!When I received it, I was so happy with how they handled the package!It was wrapped nicely and was all in tacked.The frame and the size was exactly how they described it.It was even more gorgeous in person.It looks just like the original!I am very pleased!I will definitely purchase items from this retailer again and only them!"
2,Maps,"To answer the query of a reviewer below, there are maps on pages 61, 77 and 109 showing the progress of the fire. The book also has many contemporary illustrations.This is an exciting book, revealing just how fair and how foul the human character can reveal itself in times of disaster."
2,instant joy out of the box,"This is one of those goofy little gadgets that you see but are pretty sure somehow or another it won't quite work out. Kind of like that shakeweight you bought from that late night infomercial. That said, my thumbs were taking too much of a beating from reloading - it was making me not want to shoot quite so much, so I tried it out. It is a wonderful little device! For a 92FS factory mag it fit like a glove. I actually use it ""backwards"", which is to say instead of having the bullet-end of the magazine facing left in my left hand and using my thumb to press the lever, I put the bullet-end of the mag right and use my left index finger to press the lever. Makes it sooooo much easier to load the mag, and now I'm focusing on shooting and not on loading. Must have for your range bag."
2,Great book to use for Photoshop CS,"Photoshop CS is a very powerful program and has tons of features. I really like the CS Classroom in a Book. With the use of the included CD the book lead me in a step by step procedure to learn about the features of Photoshop CS. The CD includes projects to work on while I am going through the tutorial lessons. At times, though, the book does assume that you know some of the ways to do some things. I, then, needed to experiment to see how it is done or where to find the feature mentioned. This is not all bad because the searching process is a good learning process. This book is a great way to learn to use Photoshop CS"
1,Died after less than a year,"I loved this vacuum when I first got it. So cute! So light! So red!But I do not recommend purchasing it, because now less than a year later:- The beater brush stopped working a few months ago. I wondered why the vacuum was leaving dust bunnies back on the carpet - then I checked the beater brush and found it does not rotate any more. Using the plain-floor brush on carpets does not work well either.- The WHOLE THING then died and will not turn on.I vacuum a one-bedroom apartment once a week. Not heavy use at all, but I do need it to be able to pick up kitty litter that is on the floor. It will not do it no matter how many times I go back and forth.Spend your money on something else! Because now I have to buy a new one and I will not buy this brand again."
2,Dying to Read More,"I purchased this book at a thrift store in the Outerbanks because I liked the cover. My reading choices tend toward romance, but I do enjoy a good mystery. This one was pleasantly surprising.I liked Helen and found her to be believable. I liked her landlady and Phil the Invisible Pothead. I especially like that the author treats Helen's job as a telemarketer with respect. Too often in fiction, the heroines have glamorous jobs with glamorous salaries.The story moved quickly, there was a lot of humor in the story and I liked Helen. I can't wait to read the other books in the series. This was the first of many Dead End Job Mysteries for me."
2,This realist game ever,This is way better than Live 2003 I have this game and I can't stop playing it.
1,e-mail won't stay within margins,"I am about to return this printer because when I try to print e-mail (from 2 different e-mail programs) the printer cuts off the edges of the page - doesn't print with a wide enough margin. I have spent hours trying to figure out how to fix this, including about half an hour waiting for a tech support person from Brother who was no help at all. If you don't want to print all your e-mails in landscape mode, don't get this printer!"
1,This product ruined my life,"Read the title. Quite frankly, id rather be left to wallow in my own disgust at the gratuitous misinformation presented about this most heinous of 2mm sponge paddles than go into the details of how it ruined my love life, killed my close family and resulted in the decenstruction of every institution i hold dear. Good weight though, quite easy to use."
1,Better than stock,"These sound okay when combined with other stock speakers, but overall are not good speakers. The highs are muffled and claps sound like cardboard. I'm not running any bass through these, and they still distort. However, they match the sound of my stock speakers in the back pretty well. The Kappas are WORLDS better, but don't necessarily sound good with other brands, like the Polk db series or my stock speakers, IMO."
2,Worth watching but flawed,"I had seen a few clips on Youtube and awaited with great anticipation the release of this film. The beginning is the best section, the encounter with monks at St catherine's is enriching and powerful. Sadly the journey through Greece lacks any footage on Athos and as a result the film feels bereft of a central portion. The Russian experiences are also slanted towards the more extreme manifestations of orhtodox spirituality and consequently feels less relevant.I have watched this film three times, and have found something new on each watching. We should be grateful that the film makers have provided something on such an important subject but I was left feeling that had they worried less about the travel and scenery they could have focussed more on the faces and words of the monks which is really where this film is at its best. Recommended."
1,A lone dissenter...,"I'm going to take a different tack here and say quite honestly that I found this book not at all to my liking. Perhaps my opinion is colored by the fact that I am entirely disinterested in the whole Di tragedy, though I am not without a certain measure of respect for her civic works. Anyway, I found this book to be amateurish, the storyline implausible, and the emotions expressed within quite unsubtle in their attempts to tug at the heartstrings. It has the tone of an internet fan-fiction, without the polish one would expect from a published (and rather pricey) volume. Additionally, some passages were structurally awkward, which obscured meaning and plot flow. I'd recommend this book only to those die-hard Di fans out there with a twenty to burn. ...but go ahead and buy it if you're so inclined. After all, a portion of the proceeds does go to charity. Or so I'm told."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This purchase sounded like a great deal. Unfortunately, it was a disaster. My wife and I bought it for my mother since she was about to take a trip to Ireland. When she got there, she tried to use the camera, but it broke the first day. The shutter would only open half way, and would not take any pictures. It left her stranded on a once in a lifetime vacation without a camera. It was very disappointing!"
2,"Older is better, perhaps","I certainly agree with the previous reviewer about the quality of the work--it's an enchanting piece and deserves to be in the repertory. (I'd nominate a few more of Rimsky's operas, too, but this one is probably the easiest to sell.) The performance here is adequate, but my preference remains the 1948 recording under Golovanov. The leads are older but far more expressive, and the intensity of Golovanov's conducting is miles better than the slack direction of Yurovsky. If you can tolerate older sound, I'd suggest you Google ""rimsky christmas eve gogol"" for a treat--the complete 1948 recording on MP3."
1,the worst math book i have ever used,"this is absolutely the worst math book i have ever come across in my academic career, i feel realy bad for any body taking a linear algebra course with a book from otto....good luck"
1,Black metals skeleton in the closet,"If more people would have heard of this, there wouldnt be so many Cradle or Dimmu haters. This was the first attempt of a black metal band for selling out. Granted, the leader, Tom Warrior had no part in this album, so at least he cant be blamed.But in all honesty, avoid this turd. Hair metal blows, especially from that of a black metal band. Worst than Judas Priests ""Turbo"" by about 300%."
2,Absolutely Stunning!,"I would have to say that Lisa Kelly has the purest voice I think I have ever heard, and is a stand-out even amoung the stellar performance that was recorded on the ""Celtic Woman"" CD. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who truly appreciates a beautiful voice.I had heard Celtic music before but immediately fell in love with this genre of music after listening to Lisa and the other ""Celtic Woman"" performers, just absolutely amazing. You definately need to get one for the home entertainment system and one to put in your car as you will never want to be far from the calming, soothing, inspiring music of this talented genius."
1,Good but not quite up to par,"Had mine for two years and then the battery failed. During that time had a minor glitch and attempted to contact Casio. Forget it. There is absolutely no customer support. I should have expected it for a $25 watch, but even if you attempt to get information on any watch they sell, they don't respond. No web support, no email, and no phone call support. So make sure you can live with what you buy. I agree with other users that for those of us 40+, the display is hard to read. I've given up entering data into it. Alternate (world) time is ok, but does NOT sync with actual time (i.e. you have to make sure the minutes are correct on your own). It is very, very easy to accidental set (or remove) DST, and the display will not let you know. Same thing if you like 24-hour time. Overall, a very basic watch that is capable but has many minor flaws, the biggest which is that the battery does not last."
2,Chakras and Their Archetypes: Uniting Energy Awareness and Spiritual Growth,Excellent book! Thank you Ambika for this masterpiece!
2,"A Great One With A Great Story, Great Actors and Great Action!","As an Irishman I love anything about the Irish, especially in NY where my family is from! This is a great movie and is based kind of on the story about the fall of the Irish mafia in New York, and is very close, as it was one of there own who brought them down in NY!Sean Penn is great, John Turturro is always cool and very good, Ed Harris is a favorite actor of mine and he is outstanding and so darn cold as the Irish mafia leader, and finally Gary Oldman is my favorite actor in all of movies and entertainment, and he is so very cool as Jackie, the brother and enforcer to Ed Harris's character in the movie!This is a great one and if you like mob movies, action, gunfights, a cool story and great actors, then this is for you! I recomend this one to everyone!"
2,A sensitive story about a battle against ignorance.,"My first novel by Pat Conroy. I was really intrigued by this piece of work and I'm not sure exactly why. I guess in thinking back that perhaps that it was simply a well-written novel. Conroy has a fine way with words and a real feel for the plight of people. As a teacher, I had a tough time visualizing the situation on the island, but I had no trouble understanding the politics. I enjoyed this book, talked it up and now I am moving on to PRINCE OF TIDES."
1,"More like ""The Official Non-Scrabble Players Dictionary""","As an avid Scrabble player, I have found this dictionary to be somewhat of a joke. I am surprised by the words that are, according to this dictionary, supposed to count in a game of Scrabble. It's as if everything and anything goes. I used this dictionary for a few weeks until my Scrabble friends finally convinced me to toss it!"
2,A must have for your bugaboo.,"If you are going to drop 6-9 bills on your stroller, then 20+ dollars for a cup holder shouldn't be a big of a deal... Buy it."
2,Real-life look into the life of teens,"This is my all-time favorite movie. In some ways I can relate to this movie. I have friends who are just like these ""KIDS"". This movie takes a true look into a teens life. I recommend this movie to other teens and pre-teens."
2,"Works as planned, but wears off quickly","I use this product when i run, and I've got no major complaints, it works as advertised. prevents chaffing and rubbing, and goes on easily. my only wish is that it lasted a bit longer, but it might be because i'm in Texas and its eleventy billion degrees in the shade. i'll buy this again when it runs out."
1,Well it worked at first anyways....,"This product started off well and kept my console nice and cool for about 2 months. But eventually it started making a rattling noise that stopped after I messed with it for a little while but later that day as I put in a new game and as it started I glanced overt at my 360 and noticed a bright red light!(bumbumbum) After further inspection it was only 1 light meaning a hardware failure as ,opposed to the RRoD, which disappeared as soon as I removed the inter cooler. So even though it may not cause catastrophic failure I would recommend against buying this and instead opt for a small fan to place behind your 360."
1,Is this price for real?,"I just found this exact item - same item #, everything - on Ace Hardware's web site for $11.99. I'm losing confidence in Amazon.com!!"
2,Poignant!,"Poignant! This comic book version of Richard III, staring Ian McKellan, is actually an extremely profound statement about our times. Jeeps replace horses, tommy guns replace spears, and hanging replaces beheading as the setting takes place in London, swinging away the 1930s in midst of a fascist coup. Richard III is beautifully portrayed by McKellan: deformed, merciless and treacherous. The movie is teaming with sex, drugs, and violence. The style is reminiscent of the modern version of Romeo and Juliet staring Leonardo Dicaprio, though Richard III is more cartoonish: bombs explode, women ware impeccable makeup with red nails, and love is shallow. The director successfully catches the mood and spirit of Shakespeares Richard of Gloucester, all using the authentic dialogue with few cuts and making a poignant parallel between Richard and Hitler."
1,"Terrible product, don't waste your money","I bought this machine with hopes that I could make hats and cocoons for babies. The plastic hooks are cheap, some don't come up and grab the yarn and leave holes in the project. What a waste of money! Don't do it."
2,Clarification,"Actually, this symphony had very few guitars as the last reviewer had stated. It was written for some number of specially built, tuned, and prepaired harpsichords...though I can't recall exactly how many there were in this peice...there were approximatly 7 or 8 harpsichords playing all at once. I've listened to this and other symphonies of his for 5 or so years and they still entertain me. Because this is real music (for its nutritional content)...it doesn't wear itself out like anything you hear on the radio...what I might call ""junk food music"". For those who enjoy fine craftsmanship (and the sound of freight trains as an ambient experience)...anything by Glenn Branca is for you."
2,"Rockin', Smokin' & Hootin'",This is one of my more favorite Bette Midler collections. She was so fabulous in the film and the music reminds me of my youth. I wish more teenagers today would pick up this one and LISTEN!
2,High quality soundtrack recording,"This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest movie soundtracks out there. The remastered version, timed to be released along with the ""Director's Cut"" version of the movie, is not a disappointment. The quality is high and the listening pleasure immeasurable. There are some added pieces which appear in the ""Director's Cut"", which were originally issued on the second CD from the original release. A good buy for classical music lovers."
2,Whatta workout!!,I'm halfway through this 60 day program. It is a blast!!! I'm enjoying pushing myself. It took me a few weeks to realize that I need to modify many of the drills in order to get the most out of it. Give it a try!
1,[real low point],"This is a real low point in ZZ Top's catalog. Eliminator was decent, though the music was buried under layers of synthesizers and drum tracks. But still, Gimme All Your Lovin' and Sharp Dressed Man were good rockers. However, on Afterburner, ZZ Top simply forgets that they are a rock band. There is almost no guitar here. It's just keyboards and fake drums. Absolute garbage! This is a disgrace, especially when compared to the group's excellent works, Tres Hombres and Deguello.Avoid this album at all costs."
2,I laughed and then I didn't,I liked the first CD a lot. It kicked was hilarious. This is one amazingly disturbed man. But because of that he's so funny. His family stuff is the best. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of the second CD. It wasn't really funny. It was more of an interview. Bill Zehme just kept ... up to him. Although the Sinatra Story on the second CD made me cry it was so funny. Its worth the money. I suggest getting Lewis Black's CD. That is funnier.
2,An amazing eye-opener,"In my humble opinion this DVD is an amazing eye-opener and should be made accessible to every citizen of the United States! Better yet, it should be made available to every citizen of the world. We must all be made aware that we all can, in no matter how small a way, contribute to the lessening of Global Warming, to assure the existence of future generations, and of our world."

2,Great magazine,I absolutely love the lace projects and the other projects are gorgeous!!! The articles and history are wonderful!! My ONLY reason for 4 stars is that I wish there were more resources for further instruction and materials and tools! Other than that this magazine is stunning and very educational!!!
2,A MOST EXCELLENT BOOK!,"This book is very much worthy of reading again and again. It should be required reading at military schools and within any curriculum of American history or African American history, at either the high school or the college level. I cannot say enough in praise of this book."
2,"Tough, Funny, Fabulous","I've never been to Detroit, but after reading Mr. Meadows' ""Silent Conspiracy,"" I almost feel like I've lived there. That's how real he portrayed the city in his novel and for that matter, he brings the same kind of familiarity to all of his characters as well.The book isn't all about character, of course, though it's impossible not to want private eye Linc Keller as your best buddy. The plot, which revolves around a long-missing group of singers, is fast-paced and filled with unpredictable twists. The dialogue is also wildly funny. Truth is, EVERYTHING about the novel seems real. You'll sink into the story fast and you won't want to come out.Terrific book all around, and the only remaining mystery is . . . when is the next Lincoln Keller mystery coming out?"
2,This CD is fantastic if you're a fan of music by Goblin!,"I like this CD very much but my favorite songs on the CD are tracks 1, 8, 15 and 16. Goblin is extremely talented. The extraordinary thing is that this group composes and performs there own songs. There music is quite unique. I have never heard anything like some of the wonderful songs they produce. If you like their style of rock and enjoy music in horror films by such great film makers as Dario Argento, you just may get a nice surprise listening to the music of Goblin. I love their music and recommend it to horror movie buffs."
1,confidentiality isn't important to the author,"Even though this story may be entertaining, it loses all charm when it as billed as an expose and pokes fun at the family. It is clear that the person that wrote this book was working only to support herself through school, and wonder if she thought at all about the job she was supposed to do, and the impact she was having on the child. No matter who I am, when I hire someone in a small business or my home, I have the right to expect my wishes to be followed and my privacy to be protected. Today employers are very limited in what they can say about employees when called for references. If the employer were to write a sequel to this book, the author would probably sue."
2,Reading at it's finest.,"After reading Jim Corbett's works, it comes as no surprise that the Indian government named a national park in the northern reaches of the country after him. A compilation of his experiences in the field (primarily hunting man-eating big cats) affords the reader the luxury of finishing a story in short order, but like a good novel, you have a hard time putting it down. Intelligently written by a dedicated sportsman, the stories reveal a complex man with a deep respect for the natural world around him, unique in today's world and probably much more so earlier in this century when India was still under English rule.The stories will appeal to a large audience, you don't have to be a hunter or even an outdoors person to enjoy these writings. If you're like me, you'll find yourself considering things you've never thought of before. Check it out!"
1,Broken during shipping,"The bulbs that survived the trip appear to be working just fine, but there were a lot of little bulb shards to clean up upon arrival."
1,Shallow pool,"In spite of the fact that hot, young French nymph Ludivine Sagnier spends half the film topless and the other half in a soaking wet bikini this is one uninspired piece of filmmaking. Charlotte Rampling is perfectly serviceable as the dried prune of a mystery writer on sabbatical in her publishers French villa. While struggling with a new novel her life becomes as contrived as a bad PBS mystery. The so-called twist ending proves only one thing - this is one Swimming Pool without a deep end."
2,... ...,"GREAT SERVICE: FAST, GOOD DISCS,GOOD PRICE! !I AM BUYING FOR MYSELF AND MY AND SIX GRANDCHILDREN."
1,I don't get it,"I think that, nowadays, it's a sign of a person being a cultured one, to say that ""Dark Side"" is a ""master-piece"", ""highly intelligent"", or whatever. I don't think so, I bought the albun and changed it for another albun in the store, only two days after buying it. WHy? BEucause I heard ""The Wall"" and said to myself: ""Uau, this is great!!"" So I thought: well, this ""Dark Side"" is one of the best selling recordings of all times (more than 23 million copies sold, until 1997). But I was disappointed. THis CD has a lot of nonsense, and it seems the musicians are making a fool of the listeners."
2,flash back in time...,"WOW! I am so glad to see this book back in print. My sister and I grew up pouring over our mother's copy and now that we both have daughters of our own we haven't known who gets to have A is for Annabelle. Now we can both have our own! This book is so delightful for little girls just starting out with their letters and learning to read. And the pictures are to die for. If there is a little girl in your life, do yourself and them a favor and BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,Vol. 4 vs. Vol. 6,I too ordered Volume 6 and received Volume 4. That seems to be endemic with this order. The task at hand is how does one get volume 6?
1,not for everyone,"For experienced programmer, this book is a waste of money because you know most of what's in the book already. For beginner, this book can be very confusing because of its strange approach. Only read it if you have nothing better to do at work."
1,Open Season 2,The DVD is not showing in any of my DVD players. My kids and I were looking forward to watching this movie.
2,A never-before seen look at a genius at work,"A fascinating look at Charlie Chaplin's creative process. Chaplin would start a movie project with a location and perhaps the most rudimentary premise, ""writing"" the movie as he went-- which meant thousands of takes and often years to complete a film. This documentary, narrated by James Mason, shows us the dedication, determination, and rigors this incredible performer took to create his many masterpieces. If you are interested in Chaplin's work, this is a must-see."
1,"Yeah, that about sums it up","Dennis Rodman should be extradited. To North Korea, preferably. Here's a suggestion: Let's trade him for that green unicorn the North Korean regime claims to have in its possession. We could release the unicorn in some wildlife preserve in Louisiana, to scare the hell out of Bobo & the Finding Bigfoot team. As for Rodman...well, I'm sure the racist, purity-obsessed Stalinist-feudal dictatorship of the DPRK is just the place for Mr. Bad As I Wanna Be.Although I frankly doubt it."
2,To the Manor Born,"A Romantic British Comedy, I never tire of watching from beginning to. . no, I won't spoil the fun for you. It is excellent, just a quick taste.Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, once rich and the Lady of Grantleigh estate/manor owned by her family for 400+years, has to sell and live in the estates Cottage. The gentleman she sells to Mr. Richard DeVere is a self-made millionaire. The wonderful clashes and schemes, abound.To the Manor Born - The Complete Series"
2,LISZT IS REBORN,"On one ocassion, Gyorgy Cziffra was hailed with an enthusiatic praise: LISZT IS REBORN.Cziffra was one of the most legendaries figures the piano has ever had. And the absolute affinity he established with Liszt can only be compared to Sandor-Bartok, Kempff-Beethoven or Cortot-Chopin.His dazzling steely technique, fingering and leonine fierceness can only be described as overwhelming and mesmerizing.If you are a hard enthusiat of Franz Liszt's piano music you cannot ignore this album."
1,"all she does is..sleep,sleep,sleep",I am not mad but all new born puppys sleep but this is a toy it was boring at first.I think it was fun.my dog passed away last year and I was so sad but this dog turned my world! now i'm happy.
2,Last Dinner on the Titanic,This is a magnificient account of the food served on the Titanic. Also the photography is exquisite. I strongly urge anyone who has an interest in the Titanic to buy this wonderful creation. Thank you Amazon for carrying the product. NanAnn
1,Feet of Flames Falls Flat,"The quality of this video approaches ""amateur home movie"" - many shots are blurry, especially as night falls and the lights glare into the camera. There are just as many interrupting cut-aways and slow motion shots as in Lord of the Dance, but at least with Lord of the Dance the camera was in focus all the time. There are also a LOT of long-distance shots from the back of the audience...like watching dancing ants. It was nice seeing the additional acts, and the changes in choreography, but overall a very disappointing video. Lord of the Dance is a much better buy in my opinion."
2,A must read,"After reading this book you will be asking yourself a couple of questions. Just what happen to American. And why did we allow our self's to become so dependent on foreign opinions and sources Randolph Leigh LT Col C.M.P Historical Section Etousa does a wonderful job of describing. Just what and how things were put into place to defeat the Nazi. After reading American Enterprise in Europe, knowing that your relatives did not server on the front line, in WWI or WWII But was part of the support team that kept our fighting men supplied. Brings on a whole new meaning to the term "" The Rear Support"" We owe the men and women who served as support and supple personal of WW! and WWII . A long over do thank you.Edward H Clark"
2,Winsome bar stools,"I purchased 4 for my basement bar and they make a nice functional addition. They're comfortable to sit on even tho the seat is not padded nor ""butt contoured"". The price is very reasonable and free shipping was included. Having them swivel minimizes the skidding around on my concrete floor when you want to change position. I did have to re-glue one back as it was improperly assembled. The back/seat portion was easily attached to the lower portion with 4 bolts and only took a few minutes."
2,"Good, innocent family entertainment","Debbie Reynolds got better as the movie progressed and it was worth the purchase. We didn't think her male counterpart was as good as he could have been, but all in all a fun family film."
2,Song in the beginning,So as asked before does anyone know the song played in the beginning of the movie doing the magasin scenes?
2,Once again: samples here don't do justice...,"The songs here are clever and original, without losing their blues flavor, and Oscher's vocals sell the tunes well enough..but he's a -harp player- folks, and these samples don't have much of that... so if you already like what you hear, it will only get better, and if you were looking for more fire, it's there on the full version."
2,"They roll fine, but I don't buy the 6 ball logic.","I have a half set (skateboard 8 pack) I use with the pusher wheels I occasionally put on the inside axles of my quads.Using fewer/larger balls puts the stress onto fewer points than with a seven ball (standard) or eight ball (Fafnir, Qube 8 Ball) setup. I would expect these bearings not to hold up as well as a seven or eight ball set would.I'd be pointing a friend to the Qube 8 Balls myself."
2,Order this!!,"I have an overweight cat, so his vet recommended Cat Dancer to add excercise to his routine. I was hopeful, but skeptical- how could a wire and some cardboard compare to all the bells-and-whistles type toys he already had?Not only did it compare, it blew all his other toys out of the water. He was a cat possessed! As soon as I got it out of the packaging, he was all over it, and I had to be the one to stop playing so he didn't overexert himself. He would not stop playing! Even my other hard to impress, 'no toys for me, thanks' cat was having a good time. It was so easy to use- just wiggle it on the ground or bounce it in the air. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
1,Product Poor / Seller Great,"Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back. For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home. I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them. I am contacting the seller to request a refund. If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating."
1,Ouch Again,"Is this really how the pipes are supposed to sound? I do like track 4 which means this recording is a little better than ""Highland Cathedral"". Once again though, the whole recording is badly out of tune on way too may levels. I guess it's the carinets/flutes that really rattle the fillings worst on this one though. Track three really makes one wish they had never invented woodwinds. Sadly, they are not alone. Cornet Carillon is an absolute embarassment. Is that a clarinet or is someone strangling a cat? Really hard to believe that this disaster has been in print since 1972. The only really good thing about this recording is that it is mercifully short at 34 minutes total."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"My mother gave this to my husband and I so that we could listen to our baby's heartbeat during pregnancy. What it fails to tell you on the packaging is that you cannot hear the heartbeat until the seventh month. But, as my husband and I realized, it didn't work AT ALL!! We tried to listen to the heartbeat up until I my due date- nothing. We read the instructions over and over to make sure that we were doing it right but it never worked. Do not waste your money on this!!"
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read,"Being that I am a history buff, I was so excited when I bought this book. I couldn't have been more wrong. Normally, I can finish a book in six hours; this book took me three weeks. I kept falling asleep reading it!There are no characters or a plot, it reads like a term paper--just facts and dates. It vaguely mentions the lives and events of the ordinary people in the year 1000, and it appears that the authors didn't make an effort to even try to make this book interesting.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book, unless you need help falling asleep."
1,R.I.P very Forgettable Disc,Big Pun was a Cool Brother but his Work was Often Lacking.the Music&Lyrics here just are Typical Industry Fair.We Don't Care is a Tight cut as is My Turn.but on a Whole it's nothing worth Getting.it's Sad cuz He had some Talent.but this isn't the way it should have Ended.
1,Brahms for the faint-hearted,"Brahms 2nd is one of my favourite classical pieces, a symphony which pulls it's listener in every direction, from the nostalgia driven first and second movements to the exciting and uplifting finale. This however is my opinion - and clearly not the opinion of George Szell. Szell sacrifices any passion and intensity for a purely clinical and cold approach. Sure the playing is first rate with great precision - and provides some nice moments - but stick this in you hi-fi, go and read a book or some amazon reviews, and you will forget it's on. Sorry but I happen to like the 'thick textured' whole-hearted approach of Solti."
2,Excellant Book!! Ten out of Five Stars!!!,"This book was absolutely marvelous! It reminded me of Jurassic Park with the scientific information, although the information wasn't thrown at me like I was some scientist. In other words, I was written so that a semi-intelligent reader could grasp the concepts without having to do some in depth research other his or her own to fully understand what was being addressed.Additionally, this book heightened my interest in Loch Ness. I look forward to reading it again."
2,Ray Obiedo Smooth Latin Jazz funk,"Ray Obiedo manages to put together smooth melodic grooves thatdraw from latin, r&b, funk & jazz-fusion influences creating an intoxicating mix. His smoking Santana like guitar playing aces the whole project making this a very enjoyable listen...."
1,SUCKS!,"A poorly designed product doesn't require a whole lot wrong to be utterly worthless, so please be aware of the sheer number of problems with this piece of crap before you buy it: - Early versions (mine) have a rubberized skin that shreds the first time you put it in your pocket. It looks terrible after one day. - The product looks nice (which should impress ID magazine) but the software (PC) is heinous, counter-intuitive & circumlocutious. It is awesomely bad. - The Rio inexplicably ceases loading tunes after about thirty songs have been pushed on to it, and tells you you must get an upgrade. - The e-mail support for this product is terrible. The clueless replies answer questions you didn't even ask and skip answering the one you did submit. - My Rio has stiopped working and my call back to replace it is now overdue. - AVOID THIS PRODUCT AND PUNISH THE COMPANY BY CHOOSING ANOTHER BRAND. THEY DON'T DESERVE YOUR PATRONAGE."
2,Great investment,"We've been using this for over a year. The coffee tastes great, and we never have to run to the store because we've run out of paper filters. Very durable. And very green! Tell your friends, and save a tree!"
2,"No bulky AC Adaptors, super easy to setup","No bulky AC Adaptors, super easy to setup, just put it near your cable box and BINGO!!!these 2 pyramids make the magic, definetely a good investment to me."
1,Who did the audio?,"I was enjoying this show until the second act. The audio falls out often after that. How they can sell it seemed to be beyond me. Still it is a record of a B'way show. As far as I am concerned every B'way should be preserved before it closes. I am all for preserving the performences and staging, leaving it for future generations to enjoy. ""Is anybody there? Does anybody care?"" Lets save it for prosperity and for those who can't afford to get to NYC to see it!! There might be profits to be made after the show closes!!!!!!! Especially if the audio remains after the first act."
1,Holy crap!,This is one of the worst records ever by one of the worst bands ever. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Just buy Synchronicity by the Police or Listen Like Thieves by INXS. Both bands and both albums are only about 300 times better than this crap.
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this stroller because it was light weight and had all the features I was looking for. (Recline, large basket, large hood, parents cup holders etc). We used it for 6 days and started to have problems with the front wheels not turning, then the brakes broke. I called the manufaturer who was to send us replacement parts. Two months later they are still on back order. After calling and complaining to the company numerous times they now have offered me a refund. I highly recommend not buying this stroller."
2,ONE OF HER BEST WORK EVER,"Love every song, the music is ALL THAT! Her voice is the best! I do not know how long it took to make the Album, but It's GREAT! I can not think of anyone person singing like she was doing on this CD. This CD should have gotten Album of the YEAR! The music and songs still sound good today. Timeless!"
2,What I Had Hoped For,This power pole saw is exactly what I had hoped for. The battery allows me more distance from the house without having a gas powered motor. Another advantage is that the battery is interchangeable with some other 18 volt B & D tools I have.
2,This is the work of absolute geniuses,"I would say this belongs to the genre of alternative electronic pop...the first time you hear the album a couple of tracks stand out (their hits, ""Last Days Inc"", ""Dare"" etc); but the more you listen to this album from scratch, the more you get impressed with it.I've never had so much fun listening to quirky music. This album may not be for all, but if you're interested in listening to different music and not your regular ""Waiting for Tonight"", grab this.Two thumbs up, way up!"
2,Needs a lot more maps,An excellent book = except it needs a lot more maps. Specifically those for the local/regionalactions described in the text. Perhaps this could have been done (or still can be done)in a companion volume. This would allow for the inclusion of more place names as well.
2,I am looking forward to the next volume,"In some ways it is what you would expect with the acient majick, awakening evil, and quest elements. However Lisle introduces enough plot twists that you are not quiet sure who is on what side (or are they all on the same side?). That combined with excellent writing and interesting characters makes this well worth reading."
1,This is a horrible book,"Plain and simple, this book stinks. One of the stupidest plots one can imagine written by someone who must know absolutely nothing about the legal field. You just can't read this book without putting it down in disdain!"
1,This is good if you don't leak much,"I bought these because my sister who had a baby a couple of months before me recommended them, but I was very dissapointed; my clothes would always get soaked if I left them on for more than 3 hours. I'm giving it 2 stars just because they worked well for my sister who does not leak as much as I do."
2,Shoji screen,I was worried about the size of the box and being able to set it up myself. But it was perfectly packaged and easy to open and set up. I use it to hide items in my back hall and it is perfect. I will definitely buy another one. Good price also.
2,Best Metal Album in YEARS,"I can't get over how much I love A)this band and B)this album. I bought this CD purely on the basis that I kept hearing this band's name. So, thanks to all those people that were talking about BDM.This CD sounds like the best album that At the Gates never put out (maybe something after Slaughter of the Soul...), blending heavy, dark metal with fast, melodic death metal into an appealing (if not necessarily groundbreaking) hodge-podge of brutality that still has a rhythm. Every song is completely crushing. I know that some people point to the lyrics with a bit of a chuckle (or an outright guffaw), and yeah, they're a bit cheesy, but in a really cool way. If you're playing blazing-fast speed/death metal, why not write lyrics about wolves and zombies?!?! It makes sense to me.If none of that is a convincing reason to buy this CD, this might help: I bought this back in August of 2003, and I still listen to it about once a week."
2,Just read the translation...,"As a student of New Testament Greek I have been impressed by the accuracy of the translation of this Bible since I was directed to it by my professor, who happens to be Greek. He reccomended this version as a good example of how to stay true to the Greek text, but strongly cautioned us to ignore the footnotes because the person who worte them was very obviously not of the same level of expertise as the translators. After spending time with this Bible I can wholeheartedly second his opinion. I give it four stars because of the quality of the translation, but the biased and inaccurate footnotes cost it the fifth star."
1,Might be good for cat food but doubt meant for human consumption!,"Growing up on the Oregon coast, you get used to good salmon. This stuff was soggy, oily, and did not taste right at all. I ended up throwing it away after trying it. First time in my life I've ever tossed salmon! Disappointing. Wish I could get a refund."
1,A very mediocre phone...,"The phone is ok, nothing more. The reception from outside callers is fine, but when I talk, my own voice in the earpiece has significant static--it's pretty annoying!The phone is heavier then I thought it would be (Maybe all 900MHZ phone are, my old cordless was analog) and it's not very comfortable when holding it with your shoulder and no hands.I live in a relatively small apartment and was surprised that when I went to another room (maybe 50 feet away) the calls would cut out! And this is why a bought a 900 mhz digital phone!Finally, a complaint would be the apparent inability to program the numbers into memory alphanumerically. In other words, I have to scan through a list of phone numbers, instead of seeing, ""Mom and Dad"", ""Office"", etc.I probably would have sent it back, but unfortunately, I tossed the box, so I guess I'll live with it."
2,Nightwalkin.,"Took me a while to locate this album from the artisit Alisha who was pretty big in the '80s. As luck would have it, there was one vendor on Amazon selling this particular CD. I placed my puchase and received the CD on time and in perfect condition. Wouldn't hesitate from making future purchaes from this vendor. I'm 100% pleased with my purchase."
1,Very hard story to follow,"I read 50 shades of grey and was told this book was better. I was disappointed that it was not. A waste of money in my opinion. Too hard to follow, scenes not vivid enough, writer definitely cannot write good scenes. Made no sense whatsoever."
1,Dissapointed,"Living in New York City I wanted a blutooth headset that would seal out all the noise while walking in the streets. The plantronics Discovery headset I thought would do the trick since it fits directly in your ear canal, unfortunately after trying each of thge 3 fitted ear tips provided I always had the same problem, ""THE HEADSET WOULD ALWAYS FALL OUT"" . I tried attaching the supplied ear hook but that was so uncomfortable that i decided to return the headset and try something else."
1,Only used 3 times and it stopped working,"Very Frustrating machine. It just stopped pumping water. I found an article on line that said it may have blown a fuse (nothing about the fuse in the manual) Sure enough the fuse was blown (I had to remove the whole cover, 7 screws and cut a water proof seal off the fuse to remove it and replace it. No simple matter getting it all back together.) After I replaced the fuse there was a few clicking noises but it still will not pump any water (let alone heat any water). Even the short time it did work if the battery was low you were out of luck. You can not run it off the charging cords. I sure isn't reliable. Very disappointing."
1,Not as advertised-disappointed,"I ordered Read It Draw It Solve It Grade 2. The product information said this contained 180 activities, one for each day of the year. It does NOT. It contains 45 pages. It is not as advertised. Don't waste your money. I should have listened to the other reviews instead of taking a chance on this product. It's going back for a refund."
1,Never Buy this thing.,The guitar I bought had terrible sound. Strings were too high from the fret board making it hard to play. On top of which it is badly made in China and the guitar cracked at the joint between the neck and the body.Gig bag and other accessories are a hoax. The bag is thin as paper and wont last a month. The only credit I gave was to the pitch pipe tuner. Strings that come along with this guitar are absolutely the worst I have ever seen.
2,"As manufacture has defined - quite and clean fresh air, easy cleaning filter rods and wire core.","As manufacture has defined - quite and clean fresh air, easy cleaning filter rods and wire core.Quick deliver and the price perfect - no need to by filters simply clean the rods and clear the wire core on the top by lifting where indicated."
1,THIS PRODUCT WILL BREAK - DO NOT BUY!!!,I purchased this Rio Sport MP3. Within 2 months it broke. I sent back to Rio because it was still covered under the warranty and they sent me a refurbished MP3 player. This replacement MP3 unfortunately broke shortly after the second warranty expired and Rio will not replace. Now I am out $150 dollars and no functioning MP3 player in less than 7 months. I WOULD NOT NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!
1,"Redundant, repetitive, and?","I was disappointed by this effort. Friedman is obviously intelligent and well-informed, but this book came across as a series of clunky anecdotes, arguing from a premise which did not seem totally supported by much in the way of fact. I suppose this is more typical of the journalistic style one would expect, but there did not seem to be much of substance here, or any real historical context that would give this persuasive weight. Lots of snippets by various characters, suggesting some interesting ideas, but hardly conclusive.I got tired of the constant references to the ""flat world""; finally I had to give up.Others may well find (and have obviously found) this to be a persuasive and engaging book."
2,Casserole,"Love it, used it for a small dinner party. I placed it on table with hot meal that had been transferred to it and it was beautiful and held food hot. Also I was able to place in refrigerator for next day. Highly recommned."
1,NOT READY TO USE,"This product did not come ready to use. I had to buy the Poe injector which supplies power for $35.00 separetly, and then realized it did not come with the instalation software. I contacted the seller and it took them over 1 week to reply. I still cannot install it.IT WAS NOT SPECIFIED IN THE PRODUCT DETAILS that I would need to buy the power supply Poe separetly, and that the instalation program did not come with the product."
1,Warning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Metallica fan but this CD was more than disipointing. I purchased this CD the first day it was in the stores. The first thing I did when I got home was take the wrapping of the horrible case. For some reason they made a little slip in the case where they slid the CD in. I took the cd out and it was horrible scratched. Buyer beware this might have happened to other CD's but it doesn't stop there. The songs were horrible compared to the songs on previous CD's. It was just thrown together with no thought put into it. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the song unkown feeling which is a decent song. I dont recomend getting this CD.
1,You get what you pay for.,"When I bought this product I had the Linksys router to go along with it on another computer and this wireless card was receiving the signal not even 20 feet away on the same floor, and the signal is only about 66 percent which is horrible, the only thing that helps is the speedbooster but not enough to pay extra for it. This card loses connection constantly, even when I am not on the internet, the signal is horrible and the card itself is flimsy looking. My advice is to get something a little more expensive and spare yourself the personal anguish of this product."
2,"Great soft shield, better suction","Soft shield's provide better suction that helped me to produce more milk than I thought I could. Worth a try because with the more common hard shields I was lucky to get 3 ounces, with the soft shield I can pump 5+ ounces.Also found this product at Babies R Us and could have avoided the shipping fee, which were ridiculous!"
1,Drops wireless connection on EVERY channel.,"Device cannot sustain a wireless connection longer than 1 minute.Tried all the ""workarounds"", such as switching channels and bands.Happens on two different laptops and 2 different iPhones.The web interface is also needlessly difficult and illogical to navigate.Go elsewhere. This device is garbaaage."
2,A Great Companion Series for Theosophist Readers!,"Lucifer, like the Theosophy Magazine, is literally bursting at the seams with occult knowledge and extraordinary findings from around the world as it pertains to the Occult. If you are a serious occultist, then you will find these arcane articles to be absolutely invaluable to your study and learning. A veritable feast of previously hidden information!"
2,buy it,"this is the best movie in the world. Ive seen it liek a hundred times, and i still cry. Its both action packed and emotional, and i recomend it for everyone."
2,Excellent,"This is the first time I've purchased a 'pre-seasoned' cast iron pan & I have no regrets. It has all the benefits of a cast iron pan, without the need for seasoning. You can use it right away, right out of the box. Also, the pre-seasoned finish is way more uniform & thorough than any job I could do at home. I think from now on, my cast iron purchases will be for pre-seasoned items only."
2,Very insightful and pure,"This book was written in the 1940s by Dr. Grantly Dick-Read, a British obstetrician. He had a few experiences of watching women with pain-free childbirths and became obsessed with finding out why some women experience pain in labor and others don't. His conclusion? It's fear.This book thoroughly describes how fear actually causes pain and hinders labor. It also provides you with infomation that will hopefully reduce your own fears, and with exercises to help you prepare for labor.I really like the tone of this book. Dr. Dick-Read sounds genuinely excited about his discovery and what it could mean if doctors and women took the principles to heart. It's amazing to me that he wrote it so long ago, and yet it's still relevant today."
2,Awsome,"This CD is just wonderful! I love all of Chris's CD's but this is Christmas without really being Christmas. The CD is relaxing and easy going, just enough to get you in the Christmas Mood."
1,BUYER BEWARE - DREADFUL PICTURE QUALITY,"This set is produced from PAL converted to NTSC and then back to PAL. This causes motion blur, muted colours and a picture that looks very poor indeed. Why Disney chose to use these masters for Region 2 instead of the original PAL 625 masters is beyond me. The German Season One set (which I bought because it is almost unedited) is not remastered in any way and the 36 year old PAL masters used for that set (which were duplicated from the UK masters so are actually second generation) are of much higher quality than this PAL to NTSC to PAL mishmash. Not very good at all."
1,A Disturbing/Disgusting Disappointment,"I love Invader Zim, so I thought I would give Johnen Vasquez's comic book a try. This comic book is nothing like the darkly funny cartoon I have enjoyed so much. Who would actually read such a thing? People who think animal cruelty is actually funny? Johnny talks to a dead bunny that he bought from a feed store, fed once, and then nailed to the wall - presumably while it was still alive. If you think that's good entertainment, then I am certainly concerned."
2,Outstanding!,This is the best CD I've purchased in a long while. It arrived about a week ago and I don't think I have listened to anything else since! The fact that it's a soundtrack for the equally amazing book is only one of the positives. This can stand on it's own and thrive. It blows all other Crue incarnations completely out of the water! It is very moving and rockin' all at the same time.I highly recommend this to people of all ages!
1,"Attractive, effective but easily rusted set of knives.","Naively, I expected that Amazon would remove an item that was below some standard. I believe this product is essentially defective in that, despite their ""stainless"" designation, the knives rust immediately if not completely dried after every washing. A dishwasher is absolutely out of the question.I will admit that they are very reasonably priced (aka ""cheap""), very attractive on the counter, very well-balanced and, thus, very easy to hold and use, but I believe our money would be better spent on another, more expensive brand.I will further admit that I did not consult the customer reviews Amazon offers, trusting their judgment in carrying the item (and being so late in my holiday shopping).Amazon should remove this product from its catalogue!"
1,So much Potential wasted.,I am not sure if I should blame the author for this injustice or Wizard's of the Coast for their forced literary requirements. The reason I say this is because WotC makes their paperback writers adhere to a 300 page limit. I played and DM'd these modules in my younger years and there was just so much left out or not developed it is hard to place the blame on any one particular group. On the other hand Paul Kidd did a very good job with his paperback books so its hard to say. This novel could have easily been 3 books and they probably would have been fantastic. It is a shame that the Greyhawk themed books are treated like the red headed step child. Borrow this book or buy it used but do not buy it new.
1,this horn fried my car,"I'm hoping that my problem is rare and unusual. I had this horn professionally installed almost a year ago, and the horn worked great up until about 3 months ago where it sounds like it was gasping for air. When I was thinking about getting it looked at it started working again for another few months. The other night I hit the horn when a car shot out into my lane and I was traveling much faster than it, but the horn didnt go off at all. I hit the horn a few times to test it, then noticed my brake service light went off.The next day my car was incapacitated and I had it towed and looked at. They say that the horn caused some sort of short and took out my Brake lamp switch which prevented me from getting the car out of park. I had to spend quite a bit to get the horn installed in the first place, and again to have Wolo horn replaced with a stock horn to prevent more liability problems with Honda.I just emailed Wolo to see what their response is."
1,What happened Limp?,"This CD is horrible albeit a few points. ""Take a Look Around"" is probably Limp's last great stand. But I think these guys have seriously sold out to MTV. Anyone seen the video for ""Rollin""? Fred in a ballroom with girl dancers. Im sorry but this is to N'Sync or Britney Spears to be metal/rap. And yes, I did listen to the lyrics, but Im sorry. When Fred sais the ""F"" Word after every sentence, it gets pretty rediculous. 3-Dollar Bill was Limps best album and even Signifigant Other was good. But i think this CD really lacks power. Ill give props to Wes because he is in my opinion one of the best guitar players of any metal band today (aside from Kirk of Metallica). Unfortunately Limp will be praised by every TRL fan out there and this CD will succeed. Oh well....lets see where Korn goes."
2,Relaxing fun!,"When I was in college, a friend of mine owned a kalimba and allowed me to borrow it for a few days. I found that picking out tunes on it was fun and relaxing, and that I enjoyed the sound. When I saw this item on line, I decided to see if that would still be true. It is! The instrument was delivered promptly, and was well packaged. It is sturdy, and the wood grain is pleasing to the eye. The only reason I didn't give this five stars was that it was shipped badly out of tune, but that was corrected after a brief search on the Internet. It sounds wonderful now! Another thing to watch for is that tiny amounts of the chrome plating on the keys might flake off a bit at first, so you might want to give them a good wiping down to avoid getting any metal splinters. Overall, I'm glad I have it."
2,Wow! Success!,"This is a movie that is just amazing to me. I loved it so much that words can hardly describe. After all of the buddy-action flicks I have seen, this one seems to succeed where they could not. Everything comes together to make a funny and entertaining action/adventure movie. Its very easy to follow through the plot and the action is probably the best you can get for a movie like this. Not only that, but its easy to see what is going on! No crappy camera work or shady editing! There are so many good parts to this movie! I don't know how people didn't seriosuly get hurt in the stunts....maybe they did? I don't know, but I do know that you should go see it! You will NOT be dissapointed!"
2,"Great Book, Great Teacher","I took a class from Profesor Portales on hispanic Lit. in the U.S. the semester before this book was published. It was one of the most engaging and worthwhile classes I have taken. He told us about the book, and even read a few parts from it. Anyone interested in understanding Latino/Chicano culture in America better should definitely read this book."
2,"Good album, not their best.","This album is probably the most marketable and radio friendly of all of dashboard's albums. For the peripheral listener it may be the right one to get to introduce you to this band. But as a Dashboard fan of 5 or so years I truly hope they return to their original sound for their next work. Not for the listen-ability but for the show. To this day the fans react best to the songs from ""Places"" or ""A Mark, A Mission."" I recommend this album to everyone but I also recommend any and all of their other work."
2,No instructions,"The kickstand itself is solid, but I think it's ridiculous that it didn't come with installation instructions, especially for a relatively expensive kickstand as this. Even the picture shown here on Amazon would've helped! Other than that, I don't have any complaints."
1,Mediocre,I would actually recommend against this item. The range on the keypad either sucks or the item itself is faulty. I can have the keypad in my lap and my laptop less than a foot away and the keypad will skip numbers when I'm trying to calculate or type in a string of numbers. It also seems to independantly turn off the number lock key. Save your money.
1,Mine died too,"I was wondering what everyone was complaining about after several months of trouble free usage. Well, mine died too now."
1,Oh no no no,"From one of his own great songs - ""Oh no no no"". I reviewed ""The Film Album"" saying Neil is a great writer and singer - but not of other peoples material. This album just proves my point. ""Don't Be Cruel"" - don't sing it again. I listened to it wondering if I could hear Elvis spinning in his grave. Stick to your own material Neil, you're superb at that, but please please not this."
2,A real SWAT officers review,"I bought this game because i just wanted something that reflects on my work. I usually dont play video games so i was origionally planing on just buying it for my neice so she could see kind of what i do for a living. When i installed it into the computer i decided to play it a bit to see if it was what i really do. Well let me tell you this, i dont think it could get any more realistic. My neice is 14 and she plays it whenever she is at my house....she never really understood what i did for a living and now that she has played this game i think it pretty much summed it up for her."
1,Screen cracks,"Please be careful. This product has an inferior screen to others out there. The screen is also not covered by the company, so you will be back in your pocket to replace the screen."
1,A Disaster,"I heard a lot about how good are frommer's guides,and I had my experience using other companies guides for different countries,but I did not find a guide that is worst than this one.I came from Portugal a week ago, I spent nearly a week in Lisbon and I could write a much more useful guide than this easily.It all started upon arrival, the guide gave us wrong information on transportation from the airport to the City Centre including wrong prices and the travel info kiosk saved us.When it comes to restaurants and Cafes it suggested the worst with one or two exceptions.It gave us wrong closing time for a restaurant and when we arrived there paying the taxi driver 10 Euros, we discoverd that the restaurant closed already.The maps of Lisbon had wrong srreet names that are different than the names on the signs and on the map that we bought from there.In conclusion if you want to screw some one send him to Portugal with a Frommer's Portugal guide."
2,Excellent quality DVI-D cable,"I purchased this DVI-D cable to connect my PC to a Samsung widescreen display. The quality of the cable is very high - the cable is heavily shielded, but is still very flexible. It has molded noise chokes on both ends. This cable emits far less noise then the thin, flimsy DVI cable that came with the Samsung display. That is important to me since I run this cable near an audio system with audio cables and a mixer which tend to pick up efi/rfi noise easily. Highly recommended."
2,My daughter loves it!,I am very happy with this product as it opens both of my daughters imagination up! And it is neat to see what the thought of the day will be. I highly recommend this product to any little girl.
1,Absolute Junk!,I tried to give it a zero rating but Amazon makes you at least choose a 1.It played one CD and quit. The volume can't be turned up enough to hear it unless it is in your lap. It makes an annoying noise when playing a CD. I should have know since we have had bad experiences in the past with Emerson. I was hoping it would work because of compact design. Save your money.
2,Perfect!,"I bought these tweezers to assist with the maintenance of my aquatic plants. They are absolutely perfect for this purpose. They aren't really suitable for plucking body hair. They are a foot in length, which helps with my deeper aquarium. They were perfectly described on the website and they perfectly fit my needs. The best couple of bucks I've spent in recent memory."
2,Great album,"Unlike most of the world, I never got Norah's first album. I bought this one totally on a whim. I hadn't even heard one song from it, but I thought I'd take a chance.I'm glad I took the chance. This is a VERY good album. Norah's got a great voice and there's a nice mix of songs on here.Considering that I don't care for most of the music by musicians close to Norah's age, this album really surprised me. Norah shows a maturity and a talent that aren't very common these days.I'm glad I bought this. Do yourself a favor and give it a listen."
1,Does not fit 4 door double cab tacomas.,"This product does not fit a double cab tacoma as it leads you to believe. Seems like a good product, but there is a specific double cab floor mat."
1,delayed delivery without notification,"i have ordered this item to be delivered a few days before Christmas, as it requires assembly. The delivery was delayed and we were not notified. Finally the item was delivered Christmas Eve, however at that time we already purchased another one just like this, except it was red, from Toys R Us, it was $50 cheaper than Amazon's price too. So it worked out for us, but sure added a lot of stress."
2,This Book & It's Companion Gave Me My Life Back,"Having been diagnosed with IBS 6months ago, after months & months of uncontrollable BM's & fear of even leaving my home, I was glad to have a name for it. But like most IBS sufferers my Dr. simply said ""We don't know a cause or a cure. Go home and take Citrucel 2 times daily.""While this helped a little, it wasn't until I purchased and read, ""The First Year: IBS"" & ""Eating for IBS"", by the same author and put the concepts to work that I finally got my life back, feel well and go out without fear."
2,Bounty Hunter Gold Digger Metal Detector,"So far we have only opened it one day. My son loves it.It finds everything even pull tabs and roofing nails in the yard unless you have the trash eliminator on high. He found a metal nugget under near oak tree. Most likely is iron but we will have it anlayzed.So far, so good."
2,A special edition with more than a new cover!,"Princess Bride is a classic, a favorite movie of many. And this special edition is what a good Princess Bride fan is probably looking for. The home footage taken by cast members during the filming, the little tour guide book by ""Fezzik"", and the additional commentaries add even more magic to the movie. Did you know Andre kept Robin Penn warm by covering her whole head with his hand? It's great."
2,an honest player,"THis is a very good game, i did not give it five stars because, as people say, it is really a 2 or more player game and i often dont have that, with just one player it can sometimes be very boring, but in all other respects this game is very good, the courses are interestinbg, the minigames different, the air ride machines are very different, and it is very good overall for a spinioff."
1,"Slow pace, rather unacceptable ending.","I don't see that much attraction between Daniel and Mirah, so Daniel's sudden ""enlightenment"" as a Jew made him realize he loved Mirah who is a Jewess in the movie is quite unexpected. Rather disappointing with his choice, not b'cos she is a jewess, maybe I didn't see enough sparks between them.The other thing, being brought as a English gentleman, but still have some Jewish calling inside him is a little bit inexplicable. In the book Next of Kin said a chimpazee brought up by human consider themselves human. So, I don't buy that part.The movie is rather slow, but I would have enjoyed it better if not b'cos of the far-fetched ending."
2,BEST OF THE SERIES,"Just purchased another copy to give to my daughter. I have played this CD more than any other of the 200 or so I own. It features popular songs sung by an artist different from the one who had the hit. ""Cathy's Clown,"" ""The Rose,"" ""It's Only Make Believe,"" and ""Tennessee Waltz"" are my favorites; but they're all good. This is a lot like the ""Common Threads"" album featuring various other artists doing Eagles songs."
1,Cheapest made pad on the market,"I know alot about metatarsal pads and have purchased dozens. These pads are not only one of the more expensive to buy, butthey are lterally constructed of a piece of cardboard and a cheap small inner pad with a piece of fabric thrown on top.I would guess it cost about 50 cents to make. There was also absolutely no thought put into at least creating an anotomiocally correct design. They just threw this together to make money. How this company can sell these is beyond me.Pro-tec should be embarrassed that their name is on these. If you read this and still go ahead and buy these pads..don't say I didn't warn you.It's literally like taking a $10 bill and throwing it into a river. Worthless, at best."
2,Great product for sanitary reasons,Great product for one medium sized cat or possibly two small cats. Not really adequate for large cats or multiple (2-3+) cats. The product has functioned for six (6) months without problem.
1,not so nice,This was not so impressive. I got it last year for christmas and i am 10. It looses batteries quickly. It is also very boring and not enjoyable. the only good thing is the word prossing. And for example i lost the cd that comes for synchronizing and now i cant print or anything it comes with too many plugs and ....i deffenataly do NOT recomend this
2,An awesome show!,I knew this would be good going into it since it came from Mike Oldfield. I have been a fan of MO for decades and have never been disappointed in anything he has done. This turned out to be exactly what I expected of MO. Incredible musicianship and an incredible production.If you like MO. Buy this DVD. You will not be disappointed.Trust me even if you don't know me.
1,Mindless Action,What is wrong with today's audience? Mindless action flicks like First Contact and Star Trek (2009) are eaten up like nothing else. Save your money and watch the first four Star Trek movies.
2,Wraith.,"The ultimate read it but do not play it game. My friends and I are avid WOD fans, and this game (the real 1st edition has a ""glow in the dark"" cover) regardless of edition, was Whitewolf's red headed step child. It was the crowning achievement of (then) WOD's vision of the penultimate RPG. You play and influence not only your character, but also the ""dark side"" of a fellow player's character."
1,Did we all read the same book?,"My apologies to the author and take this critique with a grain of salt. But... this was worse than a mix of Children of Dune and Thanatopsis. Wow, what a bad book.Maybe it's just because I don't and didn't have coming of age issues growing up. Maybe its because I don't understand the horrible disconnect generation x felt from their parents or the desperate need for validation that generation y is haunted by.But... so its about a kid trapped at age 7 in someone elses body and another kid trying to fit in with the hobgoblins. *YAWN*There was a lot of potential here and while I tip my hat off to the author for his creative literary technique, I have to say that this book ranks as one of the least entertaining reads I have had in a while."
2,"again,a strange one!","chock full of ""psycho drama"" . this is again,full of shorts by avantgarde directors. although definately not for everyone if you have a love of these old black and white silent psycho drama films full of sometimes disturbing and always vague references this may be for you. they were strangly attractive to me and i keep going back trying to figure what in the world motivated the director of these shorts and never have much luck. these type of films had one last hurrah during andy warhol's reign and i consider him the last of the real psycho drama film directors.as i said before these films are going to not appeal to all people but to those that like them this is a little gem of a collection."
1,Clutches are weak,"I have owned two of the XRP models since they came out. On both drills, the clutches are failing. Even on full lock, it will slip. Also, on one drill, the speed or range selector on the top no longer snaps into place and will slide between gears with normal use. I have many more well used Dewalt drills and none of them have had a gearbox problem. I don't know if this has been fixed in later models, but I will be buying the cheaper none XRP versions from now on."
2,This is *great*!,"This is a must see for every twenty/thirty-something who grew up playing Star Wars in their friend's basement!It cleverly explains the origins of all your favorite characters - The Best, Yoda was!Lucas directed the first Star Wars film and handed off the second two to others. After Episode I's start, I'd love to see Mr. Nussbaum take on 2 & 3. His attention to detail, consistancy, and directing make him an ideal candidate."
2,I'm glad for the glimpse into the Cry Guy's life,"I've liked Johnnie Ray since the first time I saw ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and was hooked for sure the first time I heard ""Cry"", so for me any and all information on him is worth reading. Whether the book has inaccuracies or not, I feel that I got a good sense of what Johnnie was about and am even more of a fan now that I've read this book."
2,I got my money's worth!,"I bought two of these because the price was great. They are sturdy and very versatile and practical. I use the small one as a foot stool. It is the right heighth, but it would be nice if it was a little wider. The large one is a great tray table. I haven't stored anything in them yet, but they look perfect for storing throws or pillows or magazines in the future. There are only two things that are disappointing...they had a strong chemical smell and had to get aired out for several days before being able to use indoors. The second thing is that they are made in China. I am trying to stay away from those products, personally."
1,Ok,But not a page turner that's for sure... a little insight into a woman's world at the turn of the century... but not any big revolutions are revealed here... just boring... really boring...
2,top notch,All I can say is if Secretariat brings you to tears then this book is for you.Top notch!Top notch!
1,Holds trash but lid falls off a lot,"It's tall, it's slim, it holds a 13-gallon trash bag. However, the step-on mechanism opens the lid only about 3/4 of the way, and if you lift the lid by hand rather than stepping on it, it's as likely as not to fall off. This can drives my husband crazy. I am not sure why they could not just make one that permanently attaches to the lifter mechanism. We're going to have to get a different can, it's not worth the household irritation."
2,Save aDive,"If you are a diver, you better buy one of these. Worse scenario in the world is to about ready to make a dive and the equipment fails. Blown 0-Rings happen all the time. Prepare a head of time for equipment failure. This product is a must for all divers and well worth the money."
1,Good... for a while.,"I was out on the trail for four days. This was my only water purification system and it worked great for three days. The pre-filter was fantastic. It collected things I couldn't even see, leaving a brown film on the screen. The SteriPEN is supposed to give a green light when complete. On the fourth day I started getting red lights. The UV light came on for 5 seconds and then shut off giving a red light. The batteries were brand new. I took the batteries out and then put them back in. I dried the unit off. I dumped the water out and put new water in... Red light, red light, red light. I got on the trail an hour late that day and probably ended up drinking some non-purified water. I cannot recommend this product."
2,Did a good job,The book was in good condition and I was very impressed with the wrapping. The wrapping was from a German Magazine which made my day :)
1,"Old Friends Andre' Previn, Mundell Lowe, Ray Brown","I don't like the live performance applause interrupting the music - before and after, okay ... musicians are fine; great. Audience, well ..."
2,Easy to install. Easy to use. Easy to pay for.,"I installed two of these in about 5 minutes each. I'm not sure why people complain about the instructions. It clearly explains how the pressure bolts/knobs work, and that the top of the gate doesn't mate until the pressure bolts are extended against the door frame.Also, the gate opens easily with one hand. If you can't open this gate with one hand, you need to eat your spinach, because you are one weak sailor. Or, perhaps those having a problem aren't doing it right. One needs to simply squeeze the buttons on both sides of the handle, and slide it away from the frame. And...Voila! (Pardon my French.)The price is good too. Especially with the extension. (Other brands charge extra for that.) Need a gate for your baby or dog? (or baby dog?) You won't go wrong if you buy this one."
1,Creepshow?,"This movie, creepshow 3, in NO WAY upholds the Creepshow franchise. It might actually be a good purchase, if it had a different name, on a F grade horror comedy dollar rack. It really feels like they just pasted this movie together in a few days. Very little about the stories makes any sense. Loads of uneventful situations and dialogue. There is maybe ten minutes of total film where ANYTHING is happening worth seeing. Some funny things, some well done special effects and makeup. Not worth any more than a few bucks. You should not be in any hurry to see this film. You are NOT missing out. It's a tragic addition to the Creepshow films. Please wait to buy it until it reaches below five or so dollars. People who make movies like this, and tag a name like Creepshow on it, should NOT be allowed cameras.CreepshowCreepshow 2Creepshow 2 (Divimax Edition)"
2,Nice angle but too thick,"I bought this angled gauge along w/ a regular (flat) guage to adjust the valve gap on my ATV. Much to my dismay the thinnest was thicker than the gap spec, so it turned out to be useless. I kept it because it is otherwise a quality gauge. The regular gage had the thicknesses needed, so I'm glad I bought both."
2,Great Trilogy,"This is a great read. I read it in 1 day. It is similar to the Highlander series By Karen Marie Moning. Love love LOVE it:) Would def recommend to a friend... actually, already have! Great price @ Amazon and free shipping too!"
2,Great product,After seeing a super cheap HDMI cable go for 39.99 in best buy that didn't even say it was 1080. These cables are a steal. They work great and I can definitely tell a difference.
1,Too Long & Very Boring,"This book is way too long for teens, I think it was a great idea just needed to briefly touch on each subject. Teens like short stories that is why Taste Berries for teens are such a success. They needed to (KISS) Keep it Simple Stupid"
2,I don't know but I've been told,"This is excellent. My main problem running is that it's too boring. With this CD, the rhythm of the combat boots on pavement keeps me running at a steady pace, and the chants of the drill seargents and responses of the recruits makes it interesting. The only downside is that at 40 minutes, I wish there was a box set with 4 or 5 of these so I could listen to a different CD each day of the week."
2,One of the most important features of this ...,"One of the most important features of this product for me is that it's fragrance free. It doesn't make my eyes water like other lotions. It did a good job of keeping my hands hydrated. Although the lotion isn't quite as thick as others that I've used before, the Kiss My Face Olive & Aloe Moisturizer is a very good product."
1,Not an Exciting Magnetic Board,"The set is very average. Only about 5 pieces - very large characters on a small, plain board."
2,Nice,"Having owned hamilton beach this griddler rocks,quik,cleans up great! and the price was great also $29"
1,An Insult to the English Language,"I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust."
1,"Timeless Media, Please!!!!!!!","Bought today from Sams Club. Must have got in early. This is the worst season set I have seen from this company. Have purchased the previous 4 seasons. They say the episodes are taken from the original Universal master tapes. I don't know what vault these were stored in but they might have to check their storage methods because these sure look dupey as well as worn out quality. On disc 9, the Frank Carter Story, you will need 3D glasses because the entire episode is ghosting throughout the entire show. Gave me a headache after a few minutes and had to turn off. Terrible quality, I hope that Universal treats their other shows better than this. The shows themselves are great just the poor picture and sound quality of the episodes."
1,Be carefull,"Some of the reveiews you read here are writen by business owners that sell boily generators. of course they say its a great/5 star rating. I bought 1 of these generators and it was not good by any means,nor was the business in Wisconsin that sold it to me."
2,Let's Do Lunch.......,"Overall, not a bad dieting book. Its a mix between Atkins (the no breads, rice, etc part) and a fruit veggie diet. I combined it with an Herbalife diet and so far I've lost 5 pounds over the first 6 days. There are a great deal of good ideas in this book with some really good recipes, but if you have issues with eating a lot of fruits, stay away, otherwise try it out. The only issue I really had was how the author said it wasn't a fruit diet, but it is in some ways. May want to rent from library if you are really unsure."
2,Best Animated Series Ever,If you never watched ATLA you need too. I've watched many animated shows in my time and this is the only one where I've felt something for the characters. Lots of good action but still funny making it a good balance.
1,Big bummer,"This is the guy who saved the expedition on his return to K2, who in fact allegedly got Jim Whitaker to go back. Simply a most fascinating guy who sits down with ghostwriter and puts it down full of arrogance and detachment, devoid of all humor, wit, or any sense of passion or personality. So bad, I couldn't finish it, and I worshipped this guy a little after reading ""The Last Step"" by Ridgeway. Wickwire is an amazingly interesting guy, but seems to try very successfully not to be one in the book. Especially interesting if you lived in Seattle (I think) in the 70s and 80s. I just wish he made his interesting life into a halfway decent book."
1,Bragging or name dropping?,"I had a hard time reading this book with all the ""I'm so great and I know everyone, stories"". I realize its hard to pen a book but this was kind of a waste of my time.I wish I could recommend something better but I can not right now. Just skip it and read something else."
2,Excellent Educational Source!!,"I was very Impressed by how thorough the chapters were, not unlike previous nail technician books i have read. This has a good in depth look at the natural nail and it's structure, nail diseases and disorders, then also has a chapter dedicated to each stage of applying artifical nails along with some good practice tips.This book also has a great introdution to nail art, with some great designs and instructions for beginners.Overall i would recomend this book highly to people who are studying to be a tech and also to qualified techs as a reference book."
2,Gospel with soul,"This CD is full of the musical Gospel. The choir has a masterful harmony and the band provides a rich soulful R&B sound. The Psalm song is my favorite, but the others won't disappoint. If your looking for something to add to your Christian music collection, this is it!"
1,just awful. not happy at all,"Terrible! Ordered this as a wedding gift. The Decanter looks like a chemistry beaker with pegs on it and the glass is so thin I was afraid it would break before we even got it to them. And the glasses are a neat concept, but are only slightly bigger than shot glasses. TOTAL waste of money! Had to go buy something else last minuet. Save your money and buy something else"
1,Don't buy these!,"Terrible, waste of money and effort. The plastic in these leaked and melted on almost every bag. I froze milk in these for four months, and the majority of bags have leaked and resulted in a tremendous amount of milk being wasted. Don't waste your time or money. Lansinoh worked much better - much thicker plastic."
2,Unique,"Wow! Vanessa Carlton is definitely doing her own thing! Be Not Nobody is a refreshing CD of new, original music (barring the cover of Paint It Black) that is an extreme pleasure to listen to! I was anticipating the release of this CD for close to two months after first hearing A Thousand Miles, and what I got pleasantly surprised me. It is NOT a CD full of A Thousand Miles remixes like so many pop CDs are. Every song has it's own sound and it's own message, and there is only one song that I skip on a regular basis (Prince...it's weird in a bad way). Overall, it's a nice debut album from a young woman with loads of potential! Recommended for anyone who is sick and tired of a music scene dominated by manufactured sounds like Britney Spears. Also, check out Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne."
2,"Bring That ""Grime"" Music To The U.S.","Second time around, Dizzee Rascal's new album ""Showtime"" is much more exclusive than his first. He is a different rapper than what we hear in the states, trust me. I can't help but get heavy into the beats (it's bananas~in a good way). He is to the point, having nothing to hide, and nothing to be phony about. Coming from the South side of London, Dizzee is street. ""Dream"" is one track that you can sit back and laugh to, because you'd never suspect an artist to put that type of music as the background and with his lyrics, he makes the track ""hot"". I've always been a fan of garage music and trip-hop but he is one that is making me love it much more. Overall this CD will make him much more popular in the states. If you check out Vibe, Source, Blender, and Source, they all give Dizzee Rascals great reviews. Definetely worth owning!!!"
1,The Smell is Horrible!,"I should have known that there was something wrong when there's a leather jacket offered for $20 bucks. BUT I figured hey, this is Amazon, how bad could it be? As soon as I opened the plastic wrap package, the entire house was filled with this toxic smell that was really sickening. We hung the jacket in the garage and it stunk up the garage. It's hanging in the back yard right now, and when you go outside you can still smell it. It's going back in plastic. This time a garbage bag. Trust your instincts!"
1,Great Movie but UltraViolet is horrible and needs to be replaced with an iTunes copy,Another great movie in the Sherlock Holmes series but horrible choice for the Digital Copy. I want to use iTunes which you allowed for the first Sherlock Holmes movie.I will give the movie a better review if you get rid of UltraViolet.
1,Slapshot 2 needs penalty time,"This is the worst sequel ever... The hanson brothers, the reason I bought the DVD, are barely in it and to make it worse it isn't even funny... although that should be obvious when you see Stephen Baldwin is in it. In other words, don't bother with this movie... save the [money] and buy the 25th anniversary of the original Slap Shot... much better film."
2,I love these!,"These are great! Just pump the milk in to these and freeze for Daddy to feed the baby. I can finally sleep in on his days off now because I have these to store all that milk. I just wished that I bought more of these. They are easy to clean because of the wipe opening. Small, light weight and easy to travel with. This is a must have for all mom's."
2,Dated but Good,This is a high quality instructional on the fundementals of Modern Army Combatives prior to 2000. Every technique on this video is still in the level I program but more have been added including fighting over your rifle. The instruction is clear and easy to follow. My only complaint is the length of the disclaimer and the fact that you cannot bypass it.
1,ummm....,"i dont intend you t opublish this, but as i know you read and check the reviews before posting them, i just wanted to say that i agreewith the guy this is a scam. Its too weird taht in every book theres like minimum 16 recommendations to those same books in the trilogy, for God's sake, even in the lord of the rings movie, theres lik1 16 recommendations to read this book, and other 6 to readest instead of the movie!! how can you compare a book to a movie, and how can you compare that classic with these books? I know everyone is free to put their opinion but theres definately something suspicious here about all this.... by the way i havent read the book, but i dont want anymore with this"
1,Complete bunk,"This movie is a successful attempt at getting rich off of a controversial decision to go to war to liberate Iraq from a murderous dictator. Moore is a liar, a fraud, and an admitted enemy of the American people. He had capitalized on the natural fear that people experience whenever they are at war....& yes, people, we are at war."
1,Major dissappointment!,"Over 400 licensed cars, numerous tracks, offroad and onroad racing, and a sequel to the best racing game of all time! The stuff-o-meter is bursting! Sound like a mixture for pure bliss? Your right! It is! However, this game doesn't live up to what it should be. The graphics would have looked good 3 years ago, and the cars, and I mean all the cars, handle terribly! Avoid this game! Buy the original! It's a much better game!"
1,Music?,"I have to give a lot of respect for a couple of pre-teens to go on tour, make music, display some showmanship. This has got to be a big boost for all of you young'uns out there. Positive music is a good thing.But I gotta be honest - I'm not really thrilled with this group. When my buddy played it for me (or forced me to listen to it while he grilled out last week, however you want to interpret it), it sounded like Disney decided to produce an album from four of its karaoke contest winners. Emmi, Brittany, Kelsey, and whatever the fourth one's name is, should stick to studies and contribute meaningfully to society by discovering cures for cancer, becoming US ambassadors, or piloting shuttles into outer space. We seriously don't need another Hansen.You may point out at this juncture that Hansen was different because they were boys, not girls. You can not convince me of this, though.For serious talent from young artists, try Charlotte Church."
1,Boooooring,"Sorry ... I really wanted to like this collection, and gave it a fighting chance, but it's just so incredibly boring. yes, the physics are too surreal, the flippers don't act right etc., but all that could be overlooked if the game play was there. It isn't. There is nothing special at all about any of the tables.Didn't the designers ever go out and play real pinball games? I could play something like Whirlwind (the one from the early 90's) or T2 for hours, they had some interesting features and good game play ... heck, some of the stuff from the 50's is more fun than these tables.*sigh* Just lame, boring stuff."
2,Another hit from the ATL,"After I heard the single 'Roll Wit Me' on the radio I knew I had to buy this album. I wasn't disappointed. 'Anywhere' is a nice, mid-tempo song with lyrics that are flirty-sweet but not cheesy. 'Roll Wit Me' is mellow with a smooth background. 'Sumthin on U' is another one of my favorites- it's up beat and has catchy lyrics. Other highlights are 'Made 4 Me', 'Fantastic Fantasy', 'Just Between Us', and 'My Place', although the entire album is well produced. It's unfortunate that Co-Ed didn't get the publicity they deserved, I would love to hear another album from them since they can actually sing! The only shortcoming is that the first half of the album consists of more upbeat songs, and the second half is mostly ballads, with a couple exceptions. I still strongly recommend that you buy this album."
2,Philmore gone secular???,"It seems as though Philmore has gone secular. I couldn't even fine one referance to Jesus, the Bible, etc. This is still a pretty good C.D., although the sound is drastically different from their older albums. However, it gets repetitive. Some of the songs sound pretty much the same. The best song on here is Mon Pettite Chou-Chou. If you are looking for a good punk album, you will most likely be disappointed. Try checking out Ace Troubleshooter's self-titled release."
1,not sure it is the original formula,"We have used this product since our dog was a puppy 10 yrs ago, it has always worked great but these last 2 bottles that I ordered from this company don't smell the same for one and does NOT work to clean ears as the product did before. The company did contact me and assured me it was the same but I don't know, was a waste of my money"
1,Great except the constant buzzing noise.,"Good picture quality, the menu leaves a lot to be desired. After about 2 months of having the product the picture frame makes a constant buzzing noise...It's enough to drive any sane person mad."
2,Death,I have seen all three cube movies.And all three of them are awesome for the same reason.People get killed by a machine in a grisly fashion. And in several different ways.And they fall back to their basest of malevolent instincts while doing so.So exquisite and alluring.Of course the series would have been better if the machine killed its creators instead of innocents.Or possibly even government officials or leaders of nations.Or even extremely wealthy people.It would have been fascinating to see how a formerly 'powerful' individual would attempt to escape death only to be eliminated like everyone else.Wishful thinking.Nonetheless all three movies I can watch over and over again.Might build my own 'Cube'.
2,One Of My Favorites!,"I loved this movie! It was terrific! The old Zorro retires and a new one takes his place. The training scene is partically good. I can't wait to buy it! It has tons of action, sad and funny parts and it's altogether WONDERFUL! I hope you love it as much as I did!"
1,are these womens? Sized more like girls,"These are extremely small, I usually buy the Soffee brand and wear XL well, these I think are girls XL, definately not womens."
1,too little words collection.,"the cover is very deceving.you dont know how manys words it has,i thought it will have more words collection then pocket dictionary,i was wrong.it is very thin lean dictionary,with very very few words.it does not solve the purpose as a resource.i called the company to return it,but the shipping and handeling was non refundable,and sending it back would have cost more money,so it was not worth the effort.the cover dont tell you and the publisher dont mention it either how many words are there in this dictionary.waste of money for serious use."
2,samples are the way to go at first.,I found a site that dealt in samples. So I bought a variety of samples so I could commit to a few that i KNEW I liked.I have tried the Fruit Punch and did not like it. I unfortunately bought 5 samples thinking I would like it. I promptly threw out the rest of the samples5/5 roadside lemonade awesome :)
2,A Classic,"Albert Sack's original ""Fine Points of Furniture"" and the updated and revised ""New Fine Points of Furniture"" are as seminal, definitive and classic as the furniture the books study. For anyone serious in the study, collection or reproduction of Early American Furniture, Sack's books are an absolute necessity. With the possible exception of Henry Francis du Pont, no single man deserves more credit and appreciation from lovers of early American Furniture."
2,Great story-teller!,"Sullivan's Island is the perfect setting for a book, especially when it's written by a native who knows how to create the perfect atmosphere and make the reader feel as if he/she were really there. Dorothea Benton Frank also knows how to build characters and her heroine, Susan, comes alive as a feisty, if somewhat conflicted person who is trying to put her life back together after her husband leaves her for another woman. Susan's family takes center stage, and her sister Maggie is especially supportive as Susan seeks a new direction for her life. The chapters alternate between the present and Susan's growing-up years in a family full of dysfunctional and self-centered adults who never truly nurture their children. Fortunately their housekeeper, Livvie, fills the gap as she tends to Susan and her 5 siblings. This is a wonderful book and one which encourages me to read more of Dorothea Benton Frank's novels."
2,The Most Hypnotic Voice Ever,"I was fortunate enough to sit on the front row of a recent k.d. lang concert and was enraptured with her pure vocals. She definitely sings from her soul. I found myself actually teary-eyed, her voice penetrating through the very fibers of my being. Listening to k.d. lang is a truly spiritual experience, as her vocal qualities are simply angelic in nature.This album is a feather in her cap, as k.d. lang has outdone herself by bringing an entirely different perspective to the covers on it. Listening to each song, I am caught up in a mesmerizing journey. k.d. lang took me to places I have never been before and places I wish to return to often.Thank you for the experience, k.d. lang!"
1,Is A Cross Between Jackie Collins and George Plimpton Lit?,"Pity Poor Gore Vidal. The man clearly possesses an agile mind with a compassionate political sense. Unfortunately, these have been filtered through the murky cracked lens of a monster's upbringing. His bitter disregard of feelings or opinions not his own palls very quickly."
2,Styling off,This stylus if the best guide for my kindle fire. I could not have read effectivly without it. It is so ease to use.
1,cheap/breakable,"I got this to complete a tinman costume. My 4 year old was very sad, as was I, at the poor quality."
1,To be avoided at any price!,"This U.K. public domain release reisues 3 of Decca's miniature cast albums from the 1940's. Decca Broadway has reissued all three going back to the original master discs, which results in vastly improved sound quality.CALL ME MISTER & THIS IS THE ARMYThis Is the Army / Call Me Mister / Winged VictoryTEXAS LI'L DARLIN'Texas, Lil Darlin' / You Can't Run Away from It"
1,I love Mamma Cass but....,"This CD sounds like it was made in a tunnel, but guys this may be the best we can get."
1,Worst 802.11 card I have used,The range on this card is by far the worst of any I have in operation at my site.DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!! Go back and get ANY other card.
2,masterpiece,"every page was full of wisdom. I love how he ended the book by saying the bible is fact, not fiction. throughout the book, he made his faith subtle but at the last page, he made it clear that he's a christian, a wise christian. God blessed this book."
2,Celine Dion is the best!!!!!,"""The Colour of my Love"" is a great album. ""Next Plane Out"" is one of my favorites, and she mixes ballads and upbeat songs in one album. ""When I Fall"" is especially beautiful as is ""Power of Love"". A must-have for all those Celine fans!!!!"
1,land of oz?,"I found about half of this book helpful to me in thinking of equine relationships in a more open way. There were some interesting real-life stories and theories presented for consideration. I thought the other half of the book was a bit too ""new age""y for me. The author's alleged connection to ghost horse ancestors was a bit much for me to swallow, but interesting to read about anyway. There seems to be alot of plugging her ""equine based therapy"" and patting herself on the back for having so many unusual and amazing experiences within her world with horses.....perhaps I am just envious of this transcendental level she has the ability to frequent....or perhaps I'm not as evolved...or maybe just looking for something a little more ""earth based""."
1,Very simple,"Although there are many different subjects on this book, it is very superficial and do not explain the points. It seems like a powerpoint presentation."
2,Good mood music,"I was very surprised about how much I really like this album. This album is great for background music at a party or just nice dinner music with ""someone"" special."
1,Very disappointing,The songs on this set have been reengineered. One of the 2 CDs is particularly bad. A background beat has been added that sounds like it was done by a 5 year old with a new Casio.
1,MAKE IT STOP!,"I hate rap and Beg For Mercy didn't help me, it's just a rehash of gangsta (c)rap. (...) all made great music, but these days it's just running around in circles with the words Gangsta, (...). The millions of hardciore rap fans out there (including some of my friends) obviously suffered some serious brain damage. They don't even like Run-DMC, just 50, Usher (another fool) Eminem and the like. Rap is now meaningless crap."
1,What was the soundboard operator doing?,"I'm a huge Our Lady Peace fan and have seen them in concert twice and both times they were great, but this album lacked big time. I mean, the quality I got off of my 20 dollar GE recorder was better. The album mixer tried to juice up Raine's vocals and ruined what makes their live shows great and thats the energy. Our Time is Fading is a great addition, but I can't help to think what went wrong, is the new guitarist bad at performing live shows or is the source just that aweful."
2,Great!,Very happy to give it as a gift to a person that loves Amelia and has been a fan for many years.
1,Not odor-less! Get your money back.,"I originally registered for this then read reviews and changed to the diaper champ. However, when I did not receive a diaper pail I purchased this one b/c it was cheaper. Big mistake. It is not odor-less! I saw a friend's Diaper Champ and was convinced and purchased it instead. It works great and also uses kitchen bags. It is worth the extra money. You can get your money back from this diaper pail by calling the customer service number on the instruction manual and sending a portion of it back. I received my refund within a few weeks! I'm not sure about Safety 1st products now, all the reviews of their products seem to be bad & we had a salesperson tell us not to buy a Cosco brand car seat and Safety 1st is a Cosco brand."
1,Terrible quality,The quality of the scanning is so terrible that the book is essentially unreadable. Absolutely not worth the money. I had ready deleted it right away.
1,poor video quality,"Unfortunately in the case of Miracle on 34th Street, the higher resolution of Blu-ray translates into an overly contrasty image with a lot of noise (I mean a lot of noise) It is a shame that such a classic movie was not properly remastered. The image quality, to my eye almost unwatchable. The softer image of the dvd version is a little better. The standard for quality Blu-ray black and white reissue of a classic movie is Casa Blanca. This is an example of the kind of result possible when people actually care about quality."
2,Action movie with a twist.,"This movie is great because of the effects and action. I've never seen a movie that looked like this, my kids loved it! It's a pretty long movie, but it will never lose your attention."
1,This book is a Menace!,"Anyone who comes up with these type of ideas should keep them to themselves. I found no problem whatsoever with reading the Harry Potter series. And if people have a problem reading such stories, they should stop. No one is forcing them to read, or watch the movies for that matter."
1,What the?,"I'm sorry, maybe it's just me but I can't helping stating that this has to be one of the wrost movies I've seen in my life!Can you say boring? Can you say doesn't make sense at all? The first 30 minutes of the movie were O.K. But it went downhill after that. This movie is a prime example of a director attempting to make a deep movie with a meaningful lesson but failed on all levels. I don't recommend this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you don't have anything else to do."
1,Vidalia Chop Wizard,"Cutting grates are DULL, practically have to stand on it to chop through, and eventually broke after just a few uses. Not at all as advertised."
2,Deep,"Great lesson! I got this book from the library, my husband and I read it to our 2 year old. We loved it, and are purchasing. We know it will be years before our daughter can comprehend the message in this book, it's still very cute for a 2 year old, our daughter loves the animals. If you are reading this to your little one who may only care about the pictures, it's a great read for the parents too. We could all use a little reminder every now and again about who's important."
2,No Other Surreal Life will ever come close to this one,"This was BY FAR the best Surreal Life, and no other Surreal Life season will come close to surpassing this one. Janice Dickenson's antics were unreal, and Omerosa's attitude just adding some flavor to it all. They had star power presence with Jose Canseco, and who could resist Mr. Balki Bartokomous himself, Bronson Pinchot?Absolutely terrific season, and I've never seen another season even come close to the entertainment value of this season. The Season with Hammer and Emmanuel Lewis wasn't bad, but this Season 5 season was the best."
1,wosrt trimmer ever,This has to be the worst nose hair trimmer I've ever used. It doesnt cut very well. Feels like its pulling instead of cutting.
1,Too sticky,"I've been a Seventh Generation fan for several years, so I was thrilled to see their line of feminine products in my local grocery store. This enthusiasm was short lived when, at the end of the day, I had several layers of sticky residue built up on my underwear. I hate wasting money, but I could not stand to deal with this inconvenience any longer than I had to. I picked up my usual brand and left this package in the women's locker room of my fitness center. Fortunately, I soon learned about the DivaCup from a relative, and I haven't looked back. I still like Seventh Generation's other products, but this one was definitely a bust."
1,Disappointed,"Thought that with the name saying Karaoke it would actually be a karaoke cd with the lyrics showing up on the monitor for my kids to use to sing, but it doesn't. Would classify this as a sing along disc instead. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews of this or volume 1&2 so I have 3 disney ""karaoke"" cds with out lyrics on the monitor and not even the originally performed songs from the movies."
2,A good book to get an overview of historical Christian views,"This book takes writings from church founders, and some who argued different points that have not survived well through today in order to compare and show the growth of christianity up till the reformation. It is good in that it uses the actual writings (or translated writings in many cases) of early church founders, which unfortunately can be dry reading, but is extremely informative reading. I recommend reading it along with Placher's other book, A History of Christian Theology, in order to get a full overview of what was happening in the church during the periods of the different writings, but it can be read alone also."
2,The Word Was Made Flesh by Ralph Larson,"Good book for those with a SDA background only. Yet, it's an honest evaluation of some common mistakes SDAs are prone to make when using the proof-text method for virtually everything requiring an exegesis. Larson's target is mainly the historical-literary survey, especially within Ellen White writings & other contemporary scholars, of the Christology & Soteriology of the SDA Church over the 100-Year period between 1853 & 1953... When some of the SDA scholars REALLY introduced some confusion in an attempt to conform the SDA profile to a less exclusive ""corner"" on the subject - right before the rest of the Evangelical Community started to awake to the same conclusions embraced by their pioneers!... An interesting book. The volume (on the subject) I was missing in my library."
2,The Very Best,"This is quite possibly one of the ten finest Albums/CDs every recorded. The Byrds at this time were the best the 60s had to offer and the 60s was the time period that mattered. The songwriting by Crosby in particular was genius. I love the Byrds, I miss Gene Clark, and I only wish this early version of the Byrds could have given us even more output before the break-ups and decline into the ""Rodeo"" format. Yes, the muscianship of ""Mcguin's"" country Byrds was truly groundbreaking but the songwriting was not even close. Get this one for a real trip."
2,So much Info,"This book has so much infomation, it is fantastic. More of this should be implemented into our public schools.. A great book to help understand why the english language is the way it is..and thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery..."
2,"Great book,my children's favorite by far!!!!","I think this is a wonderful book. I have read it to my children so many times that they know it by heart. I will sometimes intentionally misread a word (e.g. It was the LAST day of school), and my children immediately say ""No, Mommy - It was the first day of school"" and will laugh uncontrollably. I think that it is wonderful to be able to truly enjoy the gift of reading to my children with quality books such as this. As they get older, I am sure they will consider reading as something that is 'fun' and not a 'chore' because of wonderful memories that come from sharing books that have the ability to make them laugh. We own four of the Froggy books now, and I hope that more in this series are published."
1,Do Not Buy unless your child has excellent balance!!,"I bought this for my 9 month old, he is able to pull up, stand and cruise but his balance is still unsteady. When he stands at the table to play and goes to move or he shifts his weight the table tips and he either falls on his face over it or sideways with the table On top of him! It only has 3 legs and is very unsteady! I contacted fisher Price to Complain, I bet you will see a recall soon!!"
2,Information-Packed Book,The book is very well written and researched. I especially appreciated the history of the Native Americans who created the blankets and their interactions with the Spanish.Joe Ben Wheat's collection of Native American blankets is being exhibited in three separate mini-collections (because of the limited space at the museum) at the University of Colorado's Natural History Museum. Two friends and I attended the first exhibit last week and thoroughly enjoyed it!
2,Sweet and depraverd,"Saint Reverend Jen, partron saint of the uncool, makes the Lower East Side, tenement to the world, seem like shangrila. She has a way of making the depraved seem sweet and the bizarre seem like common sense. This guide may not tell you what beds Washington slept in, but it may tell you what beds you can."
2,It's a very good CD.,"After seeing the movie I had to get the CD. It's dark and moody like the movie. ""Mary, Mary"" by Chumbawamba is probably the best song on the CD. Overall it was worth the money and I would recommend the CD to others."
2,"Inexpensive, but nice.","First off, even though this journal appears that it might be leather from the picture, it is not. It is a manmade material that has a nice soft feel and appears to be very durable.The gold leaf edges add to it's attractive looks. The ivory colored pages are lined and enhanced every few pages with a Scripture verse. For it's price, it is attractive and quite adequate for personal use, but I might want something a bit higher quality for gift giving."
2,Good,"The performance is good. No problems at all for me. Ppl complain about the battery case, Well, if you can figure it out, its easy. I open the compartment and close it several times a day with out breaking it. I dont think it consumes a lot of battery power(Well, I always take of the batteries after use). The funny thing is the battery arrangement, generally the -ve side of the battery goes towards the spring, but here, one of the batteries go in reverse. So there is a +ve side of one battery going to the spring in the compartment. That was terribly dumb on the manufacturing part.Another glitch for me was the size. Small is cute but not for men with huge palms. It might be really good for women but it sometimes pains my hand. Now that was a lil dumb on my part to buy a small one.Something where they could improve is... use a button that is handy to switch of the mouse. The switch off button is like a reset button where you always have to use a pen or pin."
2,Good,Overall this flashlight has worked very well and holds its charge. My only complaint is the AC plug is touchy and requires just the right receptacle.
1,Big Dissapointment,"I bought this movie as soon as it was released on DVD, what a mistake! Me and my mate sat watching, what i was expecting to be one of the funnyest movies of the year, but i was bitterly dissapointed. Sure, there are funny parts in it, but the makers of this movie don't seem to realise that it takes more than the humour to make a good film. As we were watching, my mate was busting out with laughter at parts which were simple bordom.. i sighed and said ""you laugh at anything mate"". If you haven't seen this film yet, don't bother, cause it aint worth the 1 and a half hour it takes. One more thing, Heather Graham performed just as lousey as ever in this film, it would have been a better film if Sheila Broflowski played her part for her! (nothing new there huh?)"
2,"Good mat, make sure you get some support under it though","I basically use the mat for practicing MMA on. Grappling, take downs, sparring. Seems to be really sturdy, the velcro edges hold the two mats I own together really nicely. The area I use these in is a converted garage, with a concrete floor. I would highly recommend that anyone who has a hard surface like concrete either build a floating floor, or use eggshell foam or something similar as an extra layer. The mats do a good job of absorbing energy, but I think on top of bare concrete is a little too much to ask, as it still makes for some hard landings.For the record, I had some acoustic eggshell foam (2"" foam) that when laid underneath the mats made an excellent support. With the two stacked on one another I can take a fall and not be phased in the slightest."
2,BEST OF THE THREE!,"I will be honest, ECLIPSE was my least favorite book of the whole lot. However, I did think that this particular movie was the best yet. It has plenty of romance and lots of action too, I do believe that most guys will actually like it as well."
1,WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled.,"WASA Crisp'n Light inside packaging cannot be recycled. The crackerbread is excellent, but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states I have contacted. Todate WASA has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of, nor where I can recycle it."
1,One Sided Opinion!,"Not even worth the one star you have to give, it is fine to look into the future,wonder if he knows the lottery numbers? but he does not look at the alternative Romney, a man who seems to put his personal wealth his priority, if not why will he not release his taz returns for a much longer period than two years like other Presidential candidates? what has he to hide. Yes we have high unemployment figures the UK and Europe also have the same problems, but Mitt Romney is one of those guilty of making workers unemployed whenever he has taken over companies, he has been totally ruthless, the book or movie do not look at this or if he may have money offshore? No the election of Romney will look after the Super Rich, perhaps he will take the country to war with an attack on Iran to keep the rich in military supplies pockets lined!"
2,Great company - great customer service,Choo Choo snacks is unusual in their customer service in that they are very supportive of customer feedback. This attention to the customer makes them a company worth doing business with
1,smelly and inconvenient,I would recommend the Diaper Genie Elite. This one does not mask the odors at all and you have to manually push the diaper through a trap door so you have the potential of squeezing poop out everywhere. The diaper genie elite has a trap door that automatically opens when you lift the lid.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book,"Dr. Greg Tefft is an intelligent and articulate individual but he did not write this book. It was ghost written. It has several problems the least of which are sentence with up to 35 words per sentence, paragraphs that comsume entire pages, words with up to 7 sylables in them and a medical theory that is so complex as to be almost unfathomable. The main purpose of the book is to get the reader to pay 23 times more for hair sample analysis than it cost most physicians to perform. The cost is about $10 to the doctor, about $230 if you have Dr. Tefft do it. But it doesn't end there. Next they try to sell you vitamins and minerals they say you can't get from an ordinary diet. It's a huge rip off!"
2,The best trance CD ever!!! Hands down.,"Although Paul Oakenfold's ""Tranceport"" is up there, along with Digweed's ""GU Hong Kong"" and PVD's ""Out There and Back""...""Buenos Aires"" is to me the king of them all!I've probably listened to this masterpiece over a 100 times and I always get that magic feeling that only great music creates.Enjoy."
2,perfect upgrade,I bought a bike that was a little too small for me. I had to lean over so much to grasp the handles that my hands went numb and my neck was killing me.I wasn't sure what I needed in order to solve this issue...new bar? adjustable stem? Then I ran across this product. Installation was really only 5 minutes. I had no issues with cable length. Took my bike for a spin and instantly I felt the difference. My arms have the correct bend. My hands aren't numb and my neck is fine. Also because of the angle of my head tube it brought my bars a little closer to me as well. Worth every penny!
1,Get HOT in the microwave but don't stain or melt like plastic.,"Pyrex storage containers are expensive and bulky to store - you have to store the lids separately so you can stack the bowls. They also get very HOT in the microwave so, handle with care. We have some ancient pyrex from decades ago it stays COOL in the microwave, so don't know what they changed to make them scalding hot now."
2,A Suspenseful Summer Read!,Southern Exposure was exactly the type of mystery that can't be put down! There were several characters that I suspected but I was truly surprised in the end! I loved the character of Leona Bingham and the setting of the deep south. I hope Anne Reed Rooth is busy writing another novel! My family loves a good mystery so this is one that we are passing around to each other!
2,A great game,"This is truly a great game. The sequel from Final Fantasy X, you play as Yuna as you go around the planet you are on, Spira, fighting fiends (monsters) and other opponents. The gameplay is awesome, you can decide which way you want the story to turn and there are many plot twists. You can play this over and over again and never get bored. The battle mode is good, although it plays a little like a gameboy and you can simply press attack over and over again and defeat most enemies like that. The graphics arn't as good as Final Fantasy X, they could have been made way better. Aside from all that, this is truly a great game and I love it."
2,coments...,"works great for hole punches in a bulk of 5/16"" sheet of paper. lite office work. been usint it daily for a month works great. I would say medium-heavy duty paper punches.Ponchador muy bueno por el precio, lo uso diariamente por un mes y me ha funcionado bien en grupos de hojas de 0.8 cm, diria que para usarlo en trabajo de abrir agujeros medio-pesado."
1,Please pull this book from circulation.,"Nearly everyone is correct about this new edition of a book previously held in high regard. This book should be pulled from publication until it has been corrected and issued with Vol 2. This book is in bad enough condition to psychologically damage an entire generation of statisticians. The original edition is not currently in print, but other (better) options exist. Consider ""Introduction to the Theory of Statistics"" by Mood & Graybill, ""A First Course in Mathematical Statistics"" by Roussas, ""Linear Statistical Inference"" by Rao and ""Optimal Statistical Decisions"" by DeGroot. They are older, but are correct and still fundamentally relevant."
2,Salvatore gets nice again,"I have been a fan of Salvatores ever since I got homeland which I loved and since then I have read all his forgotten realms books. This book takes you back to Icewind Dale and has all the companions of the hall return in it. I think it was a great read and a must have for all fantasy readers, but make sure to read all the other books first. Buy this book you wont be disappointed."
2,"""Swimming"" is a spectacular achievement","One might think a memoir about the death of a daughter, and the donation of her organs, would be depressing. Vincent's vivid prose and difficult psychological insights transcends her intense grief as she brings us deep into her world. Her journey tracks backward and forward in time as she slowly understands more fully her relationships with her two daughters, various boyfriends, her own parents, and finally herself. This is a remarkably moving testament to the power of loss, love, and living.Full disclosure: I met Eleanor a few years ago in a writing workshop."
2,Excellent Battery Charger,"This product is light weight, portable and so easy to use. Works very well. I would recommend this product to anyone!"
1,FEATHERS,I would not recommend this comforter to anyone. From the time I took it out of the bag it came in feather have been everywhere. It only gets worse as time goes on. It is comfortable and warm and it would look good if not for the white feather all over the place.
1,"Nice unit, terrible customer service","I bought this humidifier at the beginning of November as the weather began to getting colder and the humidity level dropped. On the third night while filling the water tank, it slipped from my hands and fell inside of the bathtub shattering into a dozen pieces. I have been in touch with Holmes customer service and both by phone and e-mail. The person on the phone told me the replacement tanks were back ordered until after Christmas and the person who corresponded with me by e-mail stated that it was December 14th. I continue to correspond by e-mail to see if the item has arrived, but I only receive ""canned"" responses from their customer service folks. The unit worked great for the first two nights I used it, but as of now, I'm out over $70 (with shipping) with a humidifier I can't use."
1,Install Problems,"Camera looks great, but crashes system every time I plug in to USB port. I am running Windows XP SP 2 on a 2.4 GHz P4 with 1 GB memory so there should be no system issues. I downloaded the updated software from Logitech and this didn't fix the problem. I plan on returning the camera.Also, according to the support email I got back from Logitech, which was no help, ""The Logitech video cameras are compatible with the USB 2.0 specification, but not compliant. This means the Logitech camera will function properly when plugged into a USB 2.0 port, but the webcam feature will function with the USB 1.1 specifications. The biggest difference between the two USB specifications is speed. So the webcam will work and have full functionality, but it will run at the maximum 12Mbits/sec speed of the USB 1.1 specification."""
2,Horribly fascinating !,"Donaldson has a very special way of describing his caracters. He descibes perfectly the most hideous and vile persons/creature ... but is it the bad guy or the hero ... You are never sure. The personality he give his caracters is so close to reality, that you will get the sensation of knowing them, hurting with them, and celebrating with them. The only bad thing i can say about these books, is that there is only 3 of them."
1,"Read ""Jivaro""? Jiva-NO!","Michael Harner's ""Jivaro"" documents a society marked by excessive use of hallucinogenic stimulants. I read this book to fulfill a class assignment. It's going to take a whole lot of acid to get me to read it again."
1,What is all the hype about?,"This book is selling like crazy and all of my friends had read it and absolutely loved it, so I decided to read it too, just to see what all the hype was about. I must say I was pretty disappointed. I read the whole book in about an hour or two, and I got nothing out of it, the whole plot is pretty lame in general. It just seemed to lack the depth and [true to teen life] perspective that other popular teen books have these days. Some people liked the poem format, but I for one found it just annoying and distracting. It took away from the plot in my opinion. In general, the book seemed like a waste of time."
1,Not even,"This is labelled as ""Stainless Steel"" on Amazon and the packaging by Nopro. But in reality, it's Aluminum. Maybe they meant the chain is? At any rate, I'm highly disappointed with how dishonest this product is."
1,Not worth the money,"I brought this nailer a month ago and I used it on a few remodel jobs. It wasn't what I expected. The depth gauge wasn't setting the nails deep enough, so I tried to adjust it and the adjusting nob barely spun. I oiled the nob up and I still got nothing. I couldn't take pliers to it because it was made of plactic which would brake or strip. I even turned the pressure up on my compressor to 110 psi and the nail head was still exposed."
2,Get A Better Picture at Amazon UK,"This series is such a favorite of my family that it has earned a nick name: Woody Booster. If you have not seen it, just buy it. You'll love it.Noting several complaints about the video transfer, however, here's a tip: Find out if your DVD/BlU RAY player can play disks in the British format (Many can -- I think its Region 2 or PAL or some such thing) and if the answer is 'yes', then go to the UK Amazon site and buy it there. Don't worry about British Pounds and Dollars, they will take care of all of that for you and delivery works just fine. Why do this? The screen resolution of the British DVD is as close to perfect as you will ever get. Almost BLU RAY quality. There is no need to settle for anything less."
2,A good movie,"THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING....... For fans of buffalo bill from the silence of the lambs, youre gonna love this one. This movie is kind of different in that it shows gang bangers from a Jewish prospective.............odd to hear i know, but seems to exist once you watch this. A typical hood life type movie but instead of life in the hood, its more like life in the big city and hustlin for your heroine addiction. Drug use and violence keeps you watching. A good story which brings a tear to your eye when the revenge scene takes place, makes you chear for and feel glad that our lead character got even. This is a very gritty and action packed movie, with a good story. Has a good lesson for living the ""cool"" life. Love the drug abuse and fight scenes in this one. You will enjoy this one."
2,Goood,"This DVD is a great view on the Boston Hrdcore scene. The bands are great and the fights are even better! No weak love songs here, just raw in your face kick-your-ass Hardcore. Be sure to pick up a copy it'll definitly be worth the 13 bucks and 48 cents you stole from your mommy's purse."
2,This is the best flavor,"Just got my package and I am thrilled. This has the best flavor of all the Tabasco products, except for the Original. Thanks People."
1,JUNK (NOT WORTH THE MONEY),When Our daughter was born our son (8 years old) saw this on T.V. and had to get it for her for Christmas. We could not find it. When we did find it our son could not wait for christmas not to se what he was getting but so he could give his sister now 8m what he thought was the best toy around. Then Christmas morning came and we opened it for her. Our son is now heart broken because no one can make it work the only way to make it work is to press pooh's tummy. At this point I am going to call Fisher Price but from what I have read from other people that have this toy I don't hold out much hopeWHAT A WAST OF $50.00 + TAX OF 15%
2,Strong and Mighty,"These are pretty tiny little magnets, but they are deceptively strong! I couldn't believe how much they would hold on my fridge. They are pretty tiny, so I would be careful about small children and dogs who will eat anything. I like the rubberized grips on the inside of the clip because they keep the papers from slipping out. These little clips hold a decent amount of paper before giving up, most likely due to the large magnet proportionally to the size fo the clip. Pretty impressive little buggers!"
1,Unbelievable...and people are buying it.,"I received this book as a gift, and it was the worst gift I have ever received. Now, don't get me wrong--I believe that God is still alive, and I believe in visions and visitations. I've had them. However...we are warned in Scripture to test the spirits, and I don't think the author did this. His depictions of hell do not line up with the Scriptures. Pointy demons that torture simply aren't there. Demons don't torment in hell, they are tormented in hell; and in fact, in II Peter 2:4 we're told that most of the demons are in a different part of hell. So, I don't know. I only got a third of the way through it and then threw it. My opinion--if you want to know what hell is like, go to the pages of Scripture. It's free."
1,"anything but ""EZ"" audio","Despite following the tutorial and walk through and reading the skimpy little ""manual"" countless times I simply cannot get this program to do anything!!! I have all the cabling and connections needed it just will not record, much less clean up anything. Total frustration and waste of money. I'd give it no stars if possible."
2,Still the Best Tannhauser on DVD,I will quickly say that this is still my favorite in my opinion the best Tannhauser on DVD. The production is lush and beautiful and the performers act excellently...Levine does a wonderful job conducting as well!5 stars
2,"Wins, but does not demolish","This album is a very healthy 4 stars. I just didn't quite feel it enough for 5 stars but it got close. The later part of the album is weaker, and that pulled it down. If the album had kept up the pace of the first half, it coulda had 5. Here are good songs:Walking a Way a Winner - this title track has great spirit and optimism.Streets of Your TownMaybe She's Human - hubby should realize wife has troubles tooClown in Your RodeoNobody's Gonna Rain on Our Parade - great beat and great feeling. The singer and her lover will do as they please without worrying about the world's opinion."
2,Very detailed posters,It looks nice and has a lot of information about US and the other one has every country and all information. The world map has all the country's flags on it. I would recommend this to any parent. I have it hanging on my office wall and it looks great. The paper that it is printed on is a little thin.
1,Poor tool,Fence is hard to adjust and set straight. Dust chute plugs up with just the dust bag attached.
1,Useless and frustrating,"My daughters each received the Leappad + writing system for Christmas. One of the units worked fine, while the other one has been replaced 3 times. I know have to go back to the store of purchase one more time. Like a lot of other people the pencil only seems to work on one side of the page, and it constantly refers to different pages that you are not on. My kids are frustrated and fed-up with the inconveniece of this product. I will not purchase another unit, and this is probably the last time I will use LeapFrog products."
1,BOO!!!!!!,This is the worst movie ever! It was shot with a video camera in some deserted office building. I bought this movie because it was rated 4-star and it never should have been.
1,This one star is really a big asterisk,"Take home lessons from the book:- Do not consume high doses of distilled milk casein from cows, it gave lab rats cancer, and- Be sure to review the actual scientific study after reading someone's interpretation of it, the difference between the two can shed a lot of light on the views of the interpreter.In this case, the author misleads readers by exposing them to only a small portion of the original data, omitting information that detracts from his general message that animal protein causes cancer and heart disease. I had a sick feeling of betrayal when this dawned on me.In these days of the ""echo chamber,"" it is important to go the extra mile and think for yourself."
1,Good material/ Bad exam prep tool,"I studied the material front to end. Aced every test on the book's attached test engine. However, I failed the Server+ exam on February 2004. I was confident by passing the book's sample tests (averaged 90+) would prepare me for the test. WRONG! The material is good but the actual test is very tough and the attachged test engine does not prepare you for the test!!! I will now try a different book and test engine to prepare to take the Server+ exam once again. Someone suggested Mike Myer's Server+ and Exam Cram..."
1,"CRUSTY!!! ITS ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER, BUT WON'T SUCCEED!","I really hate the girls that sing (a.k.a. hanson) They REALLY disgust me! I'd rather eat 15 tons of dog crap then listen to their music. They have wrecked the whole concept of pop music! Why did they make money off of saying the words mmm bop??? How hard is that!? I could make a song with the words shut the **** up hanson. What's up with brotherly bondage? And why do they order their clothes from Delia's (a teenage girls catalog)? If they're going to have long hair, why don't they do anything with it? I despise little boys that look like girls who try to do a musical act with no talent. Shouldn't some of them have girlfriends right now? Or, do they prefer each other? Sorry to all you hanson wannabes, but, go to some Chuck E. Cheese joint. I'm sure their music will have a greater impact on your brain. You can be so much smarter than to admire hippies."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!!!!,Sorry E. Lynn fans but I couldn't even finish this one whew! Thank God I got it from a thrift store for $1.00.
2,"If life is a dream, then don't wake me up","This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work."
2,Hilarious!,"It's cheesy...it's dumb...it's your typical 80's college guy flick. In other words, it's great. Who doesn't want to get laid? Who hasn't had those times where they can't seem to do anything right when it comes to the opposite sex? This is a VERY tongue in cheek look at our boy Pondo 'Hound Dog' Sinatra, a college student who just wants a piece. Gotta love it!!"
1,Pretty silly,"Dear God, it's like listening to a Spinal Tap album. Cut down on the Dungeons and Dragons, and stay away from Renaissance Festivals, guys."
1,Disappointing,"If you expect this to be in any way related to the fabulous Toy Story movies, don't buy this. There is little plot, a lot of violence and NONE of the charm or wit of the originals. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,how,how can you get the engine to work on the main game all I can get is for them to work on the explore route section
2,Sadly Underrated Gem....,"This album came out in 1986, and was honestly one of the best soul albums to come out in that year. Very nicely produced R&B/Gospel tracks. ""Sunshine"" is a very nice smooth uplifting midtempo jammer. While all tracks follow in the same vein except for ""All Of My Love"" which is decent, but, I think that they made a mistake with releasing that first as a single. ""Sunshine"" should have been the first single, and would have given her a mark on charts! Anyway, you're an R&B lover (Well, old school that is) then pick up this long lost gem!"
1,broken,"This arrived a couple of days ago, and I ran it at the high setting for an hour as directed. Then I moved it to the low setting. An hour or two later the machine started to make a high pitched noise, like someone holding one note on a clarinet or something.I tried turning it off for awhile, running it at other speeds, no help. The new noise is actually at all three speeds, it is just very apparent on the low speed because the higher speeds produce so much white noise that they almost drown it out.Has anyone else experienced this and know of a fix? I hate to ship back this heavy item, plus I had hopes it would help with a problem from my neighbors using an outdoor firepit a lot, which raises heck with my lung condition."
2,good movie,this movie could have been better. like near the end when Tom Cruise confronted Paul Sorvino about the evidence. In reality he would have been kidnapped and killed. No way Tom Cruise would have walked out that office alive. The movie changed a few things from the book version. Otherwise it was a good movie.
2,Great Deal,"I'm giving this a great review since I got it for $25 off when I bought COD MW3 online. Getting the code emailed to me was easy enough and I had no problems renewing my xbox live subscription.If not for the sale, I'd probably buy whatever was cheapest though."
2,Good product,Perfect set to play. My son has enjoyed playing with his shovel in his sand box. Plastic is sturdy and after 2 months still looking like new.
1,Doesn't do the job,"The screen is dim and letters and symbols are difficult to read because they're too broken up. Additionally, the unit is flimsy and the clock feature didn't work. It is poor in every respect compared to the Sharp Wizard, which is no longer made. I hope it will be accepted for return.Update: The seller will accept a return with a 20% ""restocking fee"" because it was opened, (it obviously must be opened before one can see that its screen is dim and letters hard to read), and I pay return shipping, which makes returniing not worth it economically. I've never had a problem with an ""Amazon"" return and will limit purchases to that from now on."
2,Worth is for the price!,"My dad bought this for me, when I sister stole my mouse and moved to Sacramento. It's a great keyboard/mouse set! For $30, it's definitely worth it. Range is okay, if you're using it near your desk and looking just to remove the running wires. Anyway, the cons: the software installs spyware/adware on your computer secretly. I had a firewall and it told me all this. That's the reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5, because of the spware/adware installation."
2,Outstanding Mainstream Jazz,"Just what one would expect from the caliber of these fine musicians. An energetic, live performance."
1,"Traditional, old school, disappointing","What a disappointment. This book reads as if it is written by a novice who doesn't understand fear in dogs at all. The methods recommended are pressure, force and flooding, rather than a more humane approach using desensitization and counter conditioning and other science based methods. I do not recommend this book as there are many books on the market that use methods that actually help the dog feel better rather than just forcing them to endure it."
1,Glenn Miller is rolling in his grave...,"If Elvis had recoded Pennsylvannia 6-5000 in the late 50's, it would have sounded someting like Setzer's horrible version. Glenn Miller is surely rolling in his grave every time it's played. Brian Setzer shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a recording studio, his music is offensive to people who listen to swing music, he mocks swing and jazz, anyone who had the least respect for swing wouldn't mock Glenn Miller that way. It sounds as though Setzer went out of his way to make Pennsylvannia 6-5000 sound as cheezy as he could make it. Setzer is a talentlass goof off. If you want some real swing try the following artists. Benny Goodman, Don Redman, Mora's Modern Rhythmists, Jelly Roll morton, King Oliver, Louis Armstrong. But please if you have any respect at all for swing, don't buy this clown Stzer's joke of a CD, an insult to swing."
1,Little magic here,"It's a well-directed and technically well-made film with a stupid plot. The story in The Magician is pure nonsense. It would have made a great vaudeville if not for the futile attempt to create a dramatic atmosphere in it (actually, all Bibi Andersson-related stuff is just that - silly vaudeville). It's hard to explain why Bergman made this subpar film after his success with his previous movies. Quite a disappointment."
2,Bonus tem,"For the delivery it comes early than I expected so thx for that issue, for the product it is working fine no problem but there are no extra bonus items at the cd so only that is a problem for me,Best Regards,"
2,GREAT AFRICAN AMERICAN BARBIE DOLL,ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AFRICAN AMERICAN QUEEN BARBIE DOLLS.GREAT FOR THE COLLECTOR OR FOR YOUR CHILDRENS PLEASURE.GREAT FOR CHRISTMAS.
2,Gorgious World Music,"The songs are marvelous. Sensual and full of lovely, cross cultural music. This is a great collection to listen and drift away to another world."
2,need a little more power and a little longer cord,"Attractive and easy install. Husband thinks it does not have enough power and we are hoping the cord will relax with use. Great feature hanging on wall and not fighting with cords in drawer or cabinet, so we are going to try and adapt."
2,Derek Rules,"The Derek May racket is ideal for defensive players who like putting the ball back in play and not making any mistakes. With the acquisition of this racket, you'll notice a great improvement in control play, as Derek guides your shots precisely all around the table. Derek leads to clean and high - quality play, and is one of the best defensive rackets out there. Points will be extended and offensive players will have to hit some brilliant shots before winning a point. The spin is also not bad at all, despite it saying that it's only 45. The speed is good, superior to Derek's bretheren racket Kassam, which is only a piece of plywood.If you're an offensive player who likes heavy topsin and attacking play, then, unfortunately, Derek is not for you. And remember: Defense Wins Championships!Control: 100Spin: 45Speed: 50"
1,Professional in Appearance Not Function,"Though the envelopes appeared professional upon arrival, when I went to use them, I was dismayed to find that that the glue did not secure them properly and the clasps were so misaligned from the holes it was difficult to fasten them. Disappointing."
1,Hawking [HAI6SIP] 6dBi Omni-Directional WiFi Antenna,"You might use the antenna for rubber bands because that it all it is good for. No help in extending range, in fact the modem's performance was better with the antenna that came on it. A real waste of money."
2,"NIce, very nice for this PRICE","Well I had an Omega Seamaster and I definitely will not say this is the same quality or movement, what I will say is that those looking for something nice to wear thats tuff and has automatic movement (albeit Japanese, so it is nowhere near as smooth as a nice swiss movement) but that said it isnice to wear, feels good on your arm and lets face it is a steal at this price! it is not too big at all, it is about 41 mm across and the thickness is what makes it feel a bit bigger- smooth bezel movement and luminescent markers are nice touches- I would definitely buy this is you want something between 0 and 600 dollars- above that look into BALL and Omega as well as TAG but thats again after 600 and this is under 200!"
2,An excellent book about saints & sainthood.,"This book focuses on recent and for the most part local saints (North & South America). It is filled with uplifting, true stories of the Saints and explains the process that the Catholic Church uses to Canonize Saints. An outstanding book that I couldn't put down!"
1,"I know I've already reviewed this book, but....",I just felt that an average of 3 stars is misleading and felt that it was my responsibility to prevent any other innocent readers from strangling themselves with this poor excuse for instructive literature...
2,The Diary of Mattie Spenser,"Sandra Dallas did an excellent job with the subject matter. The book has uplifting circumstances and low areas of concern and sadness. Unfortunately, it does not have a ""happy ending"", but it does have a realistic ending. Life was, after all, not idealistic on the plains of Colorado."
1,Too female-centerd,"This book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. All the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. If you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book."
1,"Tries to be poetic, fails.","This book has its moments when it is clever and funny, but at other times it is puzzling and downright nerdy (particularly the bit when ""Casseopeia"" is randomly thrown in as a worrying result of no more W's). But what is even more irritating than the uneven subject matter is the book's rhythm. Apparently it was more important to present lines of even length on the page than to structure them in a way that isn't tortuous to read. This book was very frustrating to read aloud to my son because the rhyming words didn't match up with the rhythm suggested by the line structure. We love books that rhyme, but this one was a huge disappointment. This book could have been very good with a better editor, but as it is it is just a pain in the neck."
2,Lovin our drunk monkey,"The poster did not come with the poster hangers but I gave it 5 stars anyway. That is how much I love this poster. It is a great addition to our home bar. We even named our bar after the poster. "" The drunk monkey bar"". Hardly original but like I said I love this poster!"
1,Liked it but it died,"I took this watch into the Caribbean, and in the course of a week it simply ceased to function. I was not diving, just body surfing in shore break and I am not used to devices as fragile as this. There is no visual damage to the device, it just appears to handle water exposure terribly"
2,Terrific!,"Peg Kehret has written many wonderful books and she is well known for her ""disaster"" books. This is one of the best books Kehret has ever written. I could not put it down. Kyle Davidson is winding up his 6th grade year when his father wins a vacation to Oregon. the family is excited about staying on the beautiful Oregon coast in a luxury hotel. When they arrive, they find the accommodations are not what they expected. Still the beach is beautiful and Kyle and his sister BeeBee are enjoying their stay until bully Daren Hazelton and his family arrive. The reader knows as the family reads the warning sign about tsunamis that they are going to be running for their lives before the book is over. His sister BeeBee is a great character. Terrific and exciting read."
2,An Exhaustive Study,"If you have not read this book, you are not well enough informed on the subject(s), even if you are a seminary grad and/or Pastor. This book is a complete treatment of the histories and comparison's of Passover and Easter. If you are a spiritual leader in any position, absorbing this book will provide the only way for you to be confident you are leading your ""flock"" with an accurate, non-biased approach, especially during the Passover/Easter season every year."
1,not enjoyable,"Before I even got this book, I had already read several of his novels and enjoyed each one immensely. However, I found this book difficult to read...There were not many places where I could stop and while reading I was wondering what the purpose was and my mind kept wandering..Finally, when I reached the end of the book I was disappointed that it ended that way. If this was the first novel I had read by John Farris, I might have shunned his other novels(glad I hadn't)I got rid of it after I finished reading it."
2,Like it!,"So far we really like our new carseat...we just bought it last night. It seemed a bit hard to install at first, but so does any carseat when you're thinking about the safety o' your lil one! It seemed difficult to adjust the straps with our lil guy in the seat the first time we put him in, BUT I think that was just because he doesn't like getting the straps on in the first place and was screaming the whole time. It fits great in our 4Runner, and I really like the padding for our lil guy--he loves that he can sit up a little higher than his last seat, and that he can sleep pretty comfortably in it (after he recovers from his hatred of getting in any carseat). So far, I recommend it!"
2,This product is not an official Star Wars soundtrack and is not endorsed by Lucasfilm Ltd.,"I saw this in a store one day and just had to pick it up. I thought it might be pretty bad, but I just couldn't resist it. Surprise surprise, it actually turned out to be quite good. It features music from the Star Wars trilogy (the original trilogy) played lounge jazz style. I know it sound crazy, but it works. This is fun, swinging, slighty silly music. If you are a Star Wars fan who doesn't take things too seriously, you will probably get a kick out of this CD."
2,loved it,I gave it to my 93 year old Mother for Christmas and she couldn't put it down. Read it on her Kindle
1,BABY SLIPS!,"I bought this because of all of the great reviews, but no one addressed the issue that the baby slips down when they are using the angled infant side of the tub. Most baby tubs have some sort of padding or rubber mat on the infant part to prevent any slippage, but this one is just slippery plastic. So I was having to hold her and wash her at the same time. I do like the other aspects of this tub, so I have not replaced it yet. Currently I just use a towel underneath her and that seems to be working well."
2,Stamps too!!!,"I got these cheese grits! they were great, except for the fact they tasted like STAMPS!!!! STAMPS I TELL YOU! STAMPS! I would definitely buy again though!"
1,You cannot be serious,"I was bought this for a present and a bit of a laugh having read Meg while travelling. I did finish the book as I wanted to see what laughably inaccurate thing would happen next. The science seems to have been gleaned from Wikipedia after pages have been vandalised. The Scotland of the book is a Brigadoon-esque fantasy construct that bears little or no resemblance politically, legally or socially to Scotland. Everyone speaks like they have just come from The Broons, they still witter on about clans. I could go on. I am ashamed to say though, that just like eating deep fat fried pizzas I did enjoy it. The scary thing is that there are some people who will believe this is a possibility..."
1,Proof positive that Reed really needs drugs.,"Yes, that's right: Lou Reed needs to go back to his drug-addled ways! Heroin, speed, Mylanta even. If this is the kind of music that comes of clean living, inspired love and maturity, forget it brother, make mine a speedball! This album is absurdly overwrought in all the wrong ways: sonically tinkered to a fare-thee-well with stream of consciousness ""Dear Diary""-esque horseshit lyrics worthy of a love-sick 12-year-old. Sure, great rock'n'roll should be passionate, but if I wanted to hear the whispered sweet nothings (key word: nothing) of an infatuated jackass, I'd drill a hole into my neighbors' apartment, and listen in as they baby talk to each other. Reed should drop the pretentious, sensitive poet routine and go back to being a gritty, sarcastic rocker."
2,Pretty good,"I thought this was a good movie overall. Is it going to win any Academy Awards? No. But, it was still entertaining. I haven't read the e-book, so I was unsure as to what was going to happen in the film. While the movie did get slow at parts, it kept me wondering what was going to happen. It's not a scary movie, more weird and creepy than anything else. Recommended for those that have enjoyed other Stephen King films such as ""The Night Flier"""
2,The Best,"I own over 100 different compact discs of various musical theatre shows. It's taken me almost 10 years of browsing and searching for that one musical that I can call my favorite. ""Purlie"" is it. Everything I like about American musical theatre is in ""Purlie."" I won't write much more than to say I never write Amazon reviews, but if you're waffling on whether to buy this one or not -- it's 70s Broadway at its best."
1,FLIMSY SYNTHETIC RUBBER MATERIAL,"I BOUGHT A PAIR FOR MYSELF AND MOTHER. I HAVE NOT USED IT YET, BUT I AM GIVING IT TWO STARS BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT LOOK AND FEEL CHEAP, IT DOES NOT GRIP MY SHOES VERY WELL WHEN I TRIED THEM ON AND I FEEL LIKE THEY WILL SLIDE OFF MY SHOES IF I AM IN A BAD STORM. I TRIED IT ON SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES AND STILL DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL DO THE JOB COME THE SNOW AND ICE. I WILL RETURN TO WRITE A REVIEW IN A FEW MONTH'S AFTER I HAVE FULLY RATED ITS PERFORMANCE, BUT I BELIEVE A PRODUCT SHOULD IMPRESS ITS BUYER EMEDIATELY. STILL, I WILL GIVE IT A CHANCE."
2,Getting over the clouds...,"William Kershner is a technical author with a flair for humor that is reminiscent of Samuel Clements. His writings are clear, instructional, and pure reading enjoyment. Bill's latest work, ""Logging Flight Time"" is a core book for the libraries of true pilots everywhere. It also is a MUST for non-fliers who might like insight into those individuals who lived during an era when aviators were heroes.Kershner's crisp collection of events from his career will appeal to all who have any fascination for the sheer fun and wonder of flight."
2,Beepofer is getting better!!!,"At a time when not many books on the subject were out there (now there seems to be too many to choose from :)), this one by far could have saved me months in research. She tells the story from a very personal perspective being brutally honest, yet packed with facts, data, etc. Oh yeah and she makes the mysterious scientific stuff understandable. It's been four (seems like 20) years since my family entered this strange new place where it seems all of the rules are backward, conventional medicine has given up long ago and you struggle with what is right or what could help and no one can really tell you for sure...I laughed, I cried, but best of all for the first time in a long while I had hope. I loved this book and I hope one day to be able to leave it on the shelf of 'remember when...'"
2,good for older kids,"I received this for a shower gift. my daughter is now almost 3 months old, and she has trouble reaching the toys to kick them. I have to prop her in her boppy pillow to reach them. She loves watching the lights, and when the music runs continuously, she can stay entertained for a long time. My friend's 18 month old can't get enough of the toy, nor can my cousins 12 month old. Definitely designed for older babies."
1,movie,the dvd cam in like new but the case was just all black did not have the cover that was horrible
2,Riveting.,Great acting by entire cast. Hard to stop watching. Cliff hanger with every episode. Would recommend highly to anyone who enjoys this genre.
1,This book tells you essentially nothing about the topic.,"This book is an OK overview of some basic photo software techniques, but really fails to say much about digital photography, that being the use of digital cameras. If you want a book that's mostly about photo editing software you could do much better, and that's the fundamantal point to this book. If you actually want to learn about digital cameras and digital photography look elsewhere, because this book has very little to say on the topic."
1,Take my advice:save the headache and don't buy this,"Bought this about 2 weeks ago, not from amazon. It works at all the wrong times. It has never once corrected my dog for barking. It has corrected my neighbors dogs, and made a correction when my dog scratched herself. The thing makes an audible beep, which is more annoying to humans than dogs. Their ears perk up and they carry about their business. The collar is way too long for my dog and her existing collar would be too thick to add the device to. The worst part for me is that Petco's return policy does not allow you to return opened items. Unfortunately the boxing, likely to prevent theft (save your time thieves this is not worth it) makes it impossible to open the box and try the device without ripping the outer box and the plastic. Now I will be extremely unlikely to charm my way into getting a refund for my $60. So my advice, don't buy this at all, but if you succumb to temptation, check the return policy first."
2,Best Smell,I own tons of perfumes but this is the only one i would use daily! My nose is very sensitive but this scent is very light. Love it!
2,Great,Great product. The sides of it dont stay in place all the time but it could be bc my dogs move alot when we drive. Defiantly would recommend.
1,Disposable pastry bags,A lot of times when Im in the middle of doing something the bags will explode all over me and ruin what I'm doing
2,Fun toy,We bought these to go with the Whizz Around Garage. They work great with the garage. They are chunky enough that my one year old can handle them.
1,Product of the enema,The only thing worse than pop music is pop music disguised as punk music. Absolutely horrible. This rocks as hard as a used teabag.
1,Translation... My god.,"Having read a good dozen of Natsume Soseki's books, I can assure you that not liking this one based purely off Soseki's merit isn't possible. Every book I've read by the author so far has left me in awe, and so when I ordered the Three-Cornered World I expected yet another amazing Soseki read. How disappointing. I thoroughly believe my hatred for this book stems from the translator and not Natsume Soseki. I really wasn't impressed by Alan Turney. He was redundant and made overall interesting topics into long-winded, arbitrary ones. He's just not a good writer. And so I have to sadly give this book a 1. Giving up on page 97, I really just couldn't take it anymore. I wouldn't recommend getting this copy of the book. If there are any other translations out there, I urge you to try and obtain one of those instead."
1,Trash,"This movie was one of the worst I have seen in a long time. A true piece of trash. It glorifies sluts and promiscuity while degrading those who believe in God or wish to save a certain part of themselves until after marriage. The plot was horrible and deserved an R rating. It is because of films like this that I've started to give up on Hollywood. I got the impression that the profanity and sexual content was created first, and then the writers tried to build a plot around that."
1,Great idea but......,"The idea of a 50"" screen in front of you is great, however the reality is that the clarity is poor because of ghosting and chromatic aboration. But the biggest factor is that it is to heavy for the nose. This could work if it was an adjustable head mount of some kind. I say that this is not yet ready to be on the market."
2,An excellent package from an enormous band!,Three DVDs from concerts performed on different eras of the band in a more than a decade span. Classic and not-so-often played songs conform a very nice compiled tour. There's a fourth disc: a CD containing the audio material from the Grace Under Pressure DVD tour.This package should be in every Rush fan collection.
2,Step Outside the Box,"There's a reason that you don't hear this type of music done with a consistency among the radio waves. Not many bands can wrap their minds around the task without rendering a virtually unlistenable album altogether. The fusion of intensity, relentlessness, emotion, and (most importantly) diversity is not often harnessed. TMV's sound is remarkably tight and makes sense to me in some odd way, which is ultimately the best way! The last time (and only time)I heard a band be able to artistically form this organized style was Arson Garden. AG coincidentally tops my fav band list to this day, not to be unseated by even the likes of Tool, Rush, or Peter Gabriel, so maybe that indicates the comparison of band I put TMV into the realm of. I have to get acquainted with ATDI to build an archival consciousness of their ability, but at this point, I'm ready to make the assumption that this the next best band on my list. Lets hope for durability and an unending creativity in the future."
2,No Glaring Issues Here,"This is mostly an expansion upon the last half of Triptych, where Martin seemingly drifts into a loving haze along with the songs. Compact songs are still the goal here, and that's fine."
1,Comic book reading level,Don't waste your time with this garbage. The author's target audience appears to be teenage girls but it insults their intelligence.
2,Don't know what all the fuss is about,"There is never a tape of the entire Super Bowl, networks don't allow it. The cover states Super Bowl 36 Champion Patriots and that was what it was, highlights of the great Patriots season. Great low angle shots on film, not video...never seen before. A must for all Pat fans."
1,"Horrible CD player, not worth it, stay far away.","I bought this CD player for 100 bucks, and it was the worst thing I ever did. First of all, if the CD has a tiny scratch on it, it won't play it at all. Seacond, it uses sooooo many batteries. I think i put in batteries every other day for this worthless thing. And thirdly, the damn ESP doesn't work. When i try to run it, it makes the CD that i'm listening to very choppy, so i have to turn the ESP off to make it sound normal. If i rotate the CD while it's playing, it will skip. That's how bad it plays. It is the worst player on the market, i don't know why they would ever sell such a thing like this."
1,"Horrible Movie, worst book adaptation ever!","I am a teacher. I recomend these books to all my students, family, and friends. All who have read them, loved them. I loved the entire book series. I was very excited when they announced they would be making a movie. If the movie had been made to the caliber of Harry Potter or LOTR, with a close following of the story and characters, then this would have been the awesome first installment of a great set of movies. Instead, we're left with some decent action and special effects, with poor acting, casting, script, and reworked plot. I wish I had waited to watch it at home, what a waste of money. The books are great, please read and enjoy them, don't waste time watching this film."
2,Powerful,"I had lost touch with Aimee Man for some time--always a big fan of Til Tuesday classics like ""Voices Carry"" (probably still the best video ever shown on MTV back when MTV used to show videos) and ""Coming Up Close"". With Bachelor, I am back--for good. This great set of songs in the tradition of Beatles/Costello is truly moving, and Mann wears her emotions on her sleeve on the best tracks--""Deathly"" ""Red Vines"" Nothing is Good Enough"". But it's all good, and I can't think of a cd that I have purchased in the last year where I can't wait to get home and put it back on the stereo. In sum, it's so rare to find an artist these days whose songwriting craft is backed up with talented playing. Aimee is truly a breath of fresh air."
2,TOP NOTCH,i have had this for years now it starts with one pull and has never let me down.. This is truely top of the line in Generators. I live in a Hurricane zone and its never displayed any trouble nor has it ever failed to start.
1,handle was broken on the first day.,Handle is made of low quality material and was broken on the first day. The Rings that connected the upper and lower pole do not fit and were useless. They are apparently for decoration purpose and I ended up not using them.Seat height was a little bit difficult to adjust.I thought about returning the product but I chose not to go through the hassle.I was hoping for better quality given the price and good reviews from others. But I would only give a 2-star.
2,Awesome!!!,This is by far some of his funniest stuff. I am going to see him in a couple of weeks and can't wait!!! Great CD will have you laughing for sure ! :D
2,Songs From Spirit - Dr. Bernadt,"This book radiates the heartening wisdom of Dr. Bernadt, an evolved guide from the world of spirit. In this warm volume are many masterful words about prayer - the equation of thought with prayer, the necessity of quieting the mind, the key of knowing the request will be granted, and the interconnection in the answering of each other's prayers. Dr. Bernadt has been responsible for the healing of many people through the healership of Larry Wayne."
1,Does not work on any of my 4 laptops! Don't Buy.,"Although the product comes with heads that fit my four laptops, it just doesn't work, on any of them. Sometimes the adapter block itself doesn't work, but when it does, the product still won't charge my computers.This product is a total peice of $%#!"
2,Only for the Serious Tea drinker,"Brewqs a fool-proof two cups of tea. Black tea comes out smooth and without any of the bitter or acidic undertones one can get from an improperly, or hastily brewed cup of tea. Although seemingly scientific in method, you wait not long for your tea to dispense. I recommend this if you drink tea regularly and use filtered water to brew the tea."
2,Arg! There be liars here.,"I bought this game for my nephew and the entire family loved it. They insisted that we buy another so more people could play. The trouble is that I could not find another game on the store shelves after christmas, so I had to order online. I highly recommend this game to everyone."
2,Rinaldi at her best!,"Rachael Marsh is a personable character and could be any teenager you meet today. She experiences real-life problems intertwined into the begining of the Revolutunary War. Rinaldi is a fantastic author, this may be her best yet!"
1,same old same old,"Lillian Ross's contributions to the Talk of the Town and to the full-length piece are estimable, but she was never one of great talents at the magazine. She has a real flair, though, for recycling her old work. The more you reread it, the thinner it becomes."
2,DCS World is now the engine,"I purchased this for flight Sim entertainment and the company industry has grown.Now the best is yet to come. DCS World, with DLC purchasing separate modules of aircraft to start the series off is the P51D Mustang, including A10C, KA50, and a new element ion sandbox modern warfare gaming Combined Arms. Now you can control vehicles, i.e tanks, AA guns, artillery etc.soon more aircraft released and Navel combat![...]"
1,Breaks to easy,"I don't know what exactly these pieces are made of, but it broke with a slight bump. I mean it was not dropped! I'm very disappointed in what ever it was constructed with. This is why the low rating!"
2,Good,"The video is well made, you can see the sequences from every angles and the esecutioner is very skillful. To give five stars I'd like to see the application of the techniques behind the forms."
1,Never Buy Thermos again,Day one: First use. Grill was coated with enamel. It came off on the chicken.Day two: Windy. Heat from BBQ melted the control dials so I could not turn it off or on.Day three: Called for help from Thermos was told enamel is decorative and not necessary for operations so they don't replace grills. The controls overheating was operator error. It seems I should have cleaned out the burners to check for spiders which can nest in the burner and cause it to overheat. Didn't matter that it was brand new! I should have paid more for the Weber Q. It would have been cheaper in the long run.
2,I love working with amazon.,The memory was easy to install and I wish I would of done the up grade 4 years ago. Crucial has a fantastic web site.
2,a great way to spend a rainy day,"i liked this book cause it was different from others i've read. It answered a lot of the questions that The Lost Years of Merlin made me think up, but it still left some in my mind. i could see merlin becoming a great wizard and everything. i can't wate for the next one in the trilogy!!!!"
2,This is an awsome cd for belivers of Christ!,"I love this album and the rest of his music, but this CD ministers to my spirit unlike any of his previous albums. I think it a wonderful album."
1,Total Garbage,"This is what I compare this book to:Joe:""I know how to make you healthy"" Moe: """" How?"""" Joe: ""Simple, exersize, if you want to know what exersize to do, pay me an extra $10 per month so I can tell you.""Thank GOD i skimmed through the book at barnes and nobles. If you want a good book that does not try to sell you a website then try out : Food-Your Miracle Medicinek by Jean Carper. It tells you facts straight up with out the garabage this Idiot Kevin trys to sell you.People like him make me sick. I wonder if there is a remidy in the Food book to cure us from people like him? :)"
2,Totally Opened My Eyes,"I began this study figuring it would be just another one of ""those"" studies that are touchy-feel-y in regards to my relationship with the Lord. I walked away, sobered, humbled and newly aware of serious behaviors I had been excusing that were inhibiting my relationship with the Lord.This study is ALL scripture -- that's what I love most about it. There's no personal opinions or psychological tangents .. it's all on what the Bible has to say. I had never thought about my ""Quiet"" or ""Gentle"" spirit ... or what the Lord has to say to me about being dignified before.Wow -- I feel as if this study has begun a giant ""thawing"" inside me -- and I cannot wait to journey through more of the Ancient Paths studies!!!"
2,Great story in a well-worn setting;(post-apocalyptic world.),"I really enjoyed this story as I have others of Ingrid's. The story and the characters remain the meat of the book, instead of incidental 'buy me' sex scenes as so many sci-fi writers (or their publishers) seem to feel are required. There are some good twists to the well-worn setting of a post-apocalyptic world (e.g. the mutations being part of purposeful experiments as opposed to random consequences of the nuclear winter) as well as very interesting character development and story line. However, the ending seemed a little rushed (thus the four stars). Though there were obvious strings left dangling for its sequel(s), too many subplot conflicts were resolved quickly and neatly. Still a great 'read' and I plan to read the sequel!"
2,You have to try Cheerwine!,This is the best drink I've ever had. It is also great in punch (search Internet for recipes). You won't regret trying it.
2,illuminating,"This thin book is a quick, breezy read. It shines a spotlight on an interesting time in American life -- the tail end of the Roaring 20s and the onset of the Great Depression -- and the long-cherished ""spoils"" system of municipal government.Many larger-than-life characters are here: FDR, Jimmy Walker, Fiorello LaGuardia, Al Smith. Smith's metamorphosis from trail-blazing liberal to the anti-Roosevelt in four short years was particularly eye-opening for me. (In school, they only taught us about the ""Happy Warrior""of 1928, conveniently foregoing the not-so-happy iteration of 1932 and beyond.) I was also struck by the enmity toward the pre-presidential FDR which was evident in many quarters."
2,Two Good Songs....,"Christina Aguilera has an great, strong voice.. She has an amazing talent that really shows.. even when she performs live.. Her voice is never weak.. I like her song ""I Turn To You"" because her voice sounds very beautiful.. and I really like the song.. I can listen to it again and again and I wouldn't get sick of it!.. And I also like ""What A Girl Wants""... my friends looooved that song.. and I liked the sound of it a lot... She may seem like a teenybopper style... But she really does have a lot of talent.. I even think she'll be around for a long time because her voice is very unique..."
1,Overall under-developed.,"To me 'Out of Hand' contained a storyline that had potential it didn't reach. For starters, there is no real gay or homoerotic action between the boys. Pretty much what you see in the trailer and in the pictures on the DVD box, is all you get. There is abundant female nudity and very breif male backside nudity.As for storyline, I call it underdeveloped. The boys becoming friends is awfully abrupt. The ending is also abrupt. Situations like Paul's mother being very poor and sick or even Sebastion's little crush on Paul seem like they will be important and expanded upon, but aren't.The movie can be slightly disturbing and explicit sexually (just not between the boys). I'll leave it at that.All in all, I purchased this film because it was advertised as a man/man love story, which it was not. Setting that aside, I felt the storyline had a lot it could have expanded on, but didn't."
2,it is the best cd in the word ever produced,"the best song on the cd is ""nobody like you"". It has koRns jon davis, and STP's scott weiland. It is a awesome cd, and it needs to be on the top of the charts and 5 stars"
2,"Outstanding music, lyrics, and atmospherics","Musical innovation at its best. Count me as one of the many new AvA fans. AvA has a distinct sound that's all their own--and it's good stuff! Tom's voice is one of a kind and his lyrical ability is one of the best. Unlike Blink, AvA's lyrics are mature, optimistic, and uplifting--this is very refreshing and one of reasons I like their music so much. There is ""real""-ness and grit to the lyrics, but without the contrived angst that permeates so much modern rock. Put simply, the music makes you feel good and I imagine that it's cathartic for Tom to be able to express his true voice unabashedly in ways he's never been able to do before."
1,Worthless,"I bought the red king sized sheets for $15, which I thought was a good deal. It was not. They are still linty after 5 washings, they pill badly, and every time I wash them they get thinner and thinner--I think they are going to disolve compltely at about 7 washings.When we did try to use them on the bed, dh would wake up every morning with sinus problems due to breathing all the lint. When you sit on the bed you see a cloud of red lint come flying up. I can't believe that Amazon even sells a product like this."
1,No good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I used this about 4 times and it decided it would quit working. What a waste of my hard earned money. I will make it a point not to purchase anything from this company again.
2,Purely breathtaking...,"This Canadian 3 piece is no joke. Mare's debut EP is so infectious, there will never be a remedy. Bands like Neurosis, Isis, and The Melvins have been mentioned in previous reviews, but you can't excuse elements of jazz and The Beach Boys. I haven't heard songs with such magnitude, power and diversity in years. The last album to really touch a nerve in a similar way for me was AENIMA by Tool.Tyler Semrick-Palmateer (former singer of The End) truly shines through out. Here's a man who sounds so vomitous and who's screams make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up (picture Phil Anselmo and Chino Moreno having a bastard son) and then slithers right into beautiful soprano moments and Beach Boy-esque harmonies. And his guitar playing is fantastic as well. Intricate chords and huge riffs make him no slouch whatsoever.A forward progress in the oversaturated landscape of heavy music, while the others are left far behind picking their jaws up off of the floor. BUY THIS NOW!!!"
2,beautiful being is what adam is,"he is an absolutely beautiful person...he's got the charm and unspoilt beauty of a child...if everyone is like him, there'll be no wars."
1,Imitation interpretations,"In this recording Tierney Sutton offers up a tantalizing collection of songs, a tribute to Frank Sinatra's moody, introspective side. Too bad the performance doesn't match the material. Her little-girl voice moves through stretched, clipped, and oddly distorted ""interpretations"" of lyrics, offering neither new insights nor convincing expression, but rather drawing attention to a conscious effort to sound different. The very pronounced piano obbligatos by Christian Jacob seem to veer between watered-down Erroll Gardner and Bobby Short, while the string choir offers not much more than very muted, simple scales that contribute irrelevant backgrounds. Is this a CD to acquire? Only if the songs you want aren't available in other versions."
1,ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITES,"I really do like most of Lisa Kleypas' books, but this is one of my least favorites. The heroine is so depressing and self destructive. Don't bother with this one. It doesn't seem to have the charm and warmth that you get from other Kleypas books"
1,"Works well, doesn't leak, but lid is designed poorly.","I agree with others about the leak-proof and keep-warm features of the mug, but the lid is not designed well, as far as cleaning goes. I have noticed that my lid smells absolutely disgusting, after using it maybe about 15 times. I get the feeling that there is no way to completely clean the lid, since there are areas inside of it that you can not get to with a sponge. And yes, I try to clean it very well every time I use it, and have not washed it in the dishwasher. Yesterday I tried soaking it completely submerged for a few hours, and that seemed to help a little bit. I think though, that if the smell continues, I will take my chances and put it through the dishwasher, just to try to sanitize it. If it continues to smell like is has been, I can not even use it anymore."
1,Epson C42 Ux,"This is without a doubt the worst printer ever made.It clogs up easily after just printing a few pages,,and the results are black lines,and black dots.Epson tech support says you need to clean the nozzle.It wastes a lot of ink to clear up the problem,and it would not take too long before the problem comes back.Epson has replaced this printer for me three times.The problems are the same from unit to unit.It uses up black ink like crazy during normal use,making it really one of the most expensive inks around based on the small cartridge size.It is noisy,and slow.I can live with that,but the quality of the printing is the pits.I am going to toss this printer out soon.No more Epson products for me.The model should be more accurately labeled the C-42 SUX"
1,The sound is terrible.,"We really tried to watch this but the sound was so bad, it couldn't be understood at all."
2,"Great Animation, story, characters...","This movie was excellent!! It had all the elements of a great adventure story/anime. I will have to say that I thought the subtitled version was much better than the dubbed, because the english voices weren't that great, and the translations weren't very good either. The subtitles make the characters, especially the Dwarf, seem more hardcore. This is definitely one of the best Animes I have seen and think it is worth the money. You'll be hooked after the first episode..."
1,very uneven quality,"I have enjoyed many chapters in this book, but I cannot recommend it. The complete exclusion of Native American languages was a damning error, despite the editor's excuses. But more than that, the book is ruined by the uneven quality of the included essays. The chapter on Arabic by Alan S. Kaye is of particularly low quality. Let me quote a sentence: ""I should also mention the elegance one can immediately feel when one is invited to DINE vs. plain 'ole EAT."" [My caps repesent italics in the text.] I find the use of ""plain 'ole"" for what presumably must be ""plain ol'"" (=""plain old"") ridiculous and hideous, and the inclusion of such incompetence in the text shows the editor's indifference to the final quality of the book."
1,DIGIAL PHOTO KEY CHAIN,IT DOES NOT STAY CHARED LONG ENOUGH. AND WAS HARD TO GET TO WORK. WE HAD TO CALL FOR HELP WITH IT. I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN IT IF I WOULD HAVE KNOW THAT ABOUT IT.
2,Awesome,"This sounds stupid..... but as somebody with ADD, making colorful notes and graphs in this notebook has helped me a lot with my calculus class. The pages are large, the paper is high quality and ink will not run through to the other side. I love it."
1,What had happened was....,"What the hell happened to Metallica and their talent? What happened to that drummer we heard on Justice? This can't be the same guy. I can't imagine them listening to this record when it was done and thinking it was good. LMAO!!! 1 star for the attempt. The vocals are bad, the lyrics are worse. The drums sound like, well, the drums don't sound like drums and Kirk is playing as crappy as ever. Nice guitar tone, buddy! Is that the best you can do? I have tried to get into this root canal of a CD but I just can't. The writing on this cd is horriblePLEASE STEAL...AND DO NOT PURCHASE. MALFUNCTION."
1,DRM ruins the game,I was very excited for this game to hit the shelves and pick up a copy but after learning of the DRM used by EA I will be passing on this one. If it gets removed I will then purchase it.I have Windows XP right now and will most likely upgrade within the next few months or so which would eat up 2 of the 3 installs right off the bat. I will not buy a game under those terms and will take my money elsewhere in the meantime.
2,ARGGGGG.....color changes...,"I received my bookcase today ( I had to order it online because the Ann Arbor stores no longer carry the the Dolce Collection... I bought 3 Dolce bookcases a couple of years ago. The last reviewer is right, the new one is lighter and redder than the other ones. But it acutally isn't too bad next to the new armoire I just bought from Target. The quality is great and it is simple and stylish. It's a good value. I wish they put the Dolce Collection back in the stores."
1,So disappointed.,"I had on of these that was several years old and was having trouble getting it clean so I decided to purchase a new one. Well it was great for about 4 months and then it began to leak. Nothing would make it stop. I think was was leaking from where the motor can be removed from the bottom, but not entirely sure. It was completely unusable at that point so had to throw it away. Not sure if I should try again or not."
1,THIS CHANNEL NEEDS TO GO OFF AIR!,"This was one of the worst serial killer thrillers I have ever read. I found the entire novel incredibly boring, sluggish, and unsuspenseful. The main character, Lucas Frank, was poorly developed and Felix, the killer, did not seem like a good candidate for a serial killer. It was a good thing that this novel was short because, the book was not exciting and seemed to take a long time to get through, even though it was only 322 pages. I did not like the ending either. I felt John Philpin did not do a good job with the conclusion of this novel. There were so many flashbacks throughout the entire novel that it drove me crazy. I have read many good novels this year, but ""The Murder Channel"" was definitely not one of them. Be smart and save your money."
1,Iconoclastic Scientism,"This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover ""everything"". If we compare Mr. Wilson's ""total map"" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an ""Environmental Policy"" category where a ""Spirits/Psychology"" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: ""Why Wilson is Wrong"" published in 1999."
1,Can not get it to re-fold.,I bought this so our cat could enjoy the outdoors safely while we camp in our RV. I've NEVER been able to get it refolded. I called customer support and was told the wire probably got bent the first time I tried to close it. I've watched the video on folding it over and over again. I've tried folding it until my hands are sore. Very disappointed in the product and customer service.
1,Broke after six weeks of use,"I really enjoyed my Urban Rebounder the last several weeks (I had the non-folding one with a bar). I weight @ 200 pounds and used it twice a day for 7-10 minutes, over 6-8 weeks. I mainly did the health bounce (feet not leaving the rebounder) and light aerobic bounces (jumping 2-4 inches off the mat). This is considered light rebounding. I heard a loud popping sound yesterday. The fabric that holds the springs tore away in one area and the spring next to it broke. I was very disappointed.This might be okay as a starter for people looking to see if they enjoy rebounding, but it's not built to last, esp. if you are close to 200 pounds or someone that likes to jump high. Consider Reboundair, Needak, Cellerciser, or Bellicon. You're going to spend 3-4 times as much but you'll have a real piece of exercise equipment imo."
2,Heaven in a bottle,"The first time I ordered this product I only got the 8 oz sized bottle. I was very unsure if it would be worth the money. But it was and is. This oil is very useful. I use it for condition my hair (morning and night), but I also use it in my baths. A few drops in your bath water will leave your skin feeling silky smooth. Definitely opt to by the 32 oz size. You will not be disappointed."
1,Beat Beast,"I'm a big fan of sea monster movies, and this one does have its entertaining moments. However, it's also a terrible film. Characters are, of course, two-dimensional, the dialogue is embarrassing, and it just never picks up any steam. We also get alternating shots of a rubbery tentacle flopping around on the decks of boats and the shabby-looking CGI monster the tentacles are attached to. I have the same problem with this movie that I have with all of the ""Maneater"" series movies I've seen so far: Where's the violence and gore? When you plug your movie with a DVD box that depicts creatures, animals, people, etc. slathered in blood, I expect to see some darn blood! Please, please, if you're a filmmaker and you're out there, and you're going to make a horror movie, please don't skimp on the grue! It's what we want! Don't you know that?!"
2,Exactly as expected.,The swivels are exactly what I expected. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the locking mechanism is tightened with a thumbscrew which I wish I could lock.
2,What a Wonderful book!,"I never ralized L. Frank Baum wrote so many Oz books. I plan to read them all because this was a good one. While "" The Wizard of Oz"" is my favorite movie of al time this book was very good. Some things were the same as the movie and some things were VERY different. I can't wait to read the others."
1,How can you be so close and fumble the ball????,"All of the press on this book is the only reason I read it. I already have my opinion of President Reagan and his Presidency. I have read several other books about Reagan, liberally and conservatively biased, and Dutch was by far the most ignorant of them all. I repect what Reagan did for America. But the whole purpose of this book is to smear Reagan and leave a lasting black-mark on his legacy. Who paid off Mr. Morris? I am not a biographer. However, if I had all of the access and time that Mr. Morris had, I could have written everyone a 10 thousand page encyclopedia set. What an absolute waste!"
1,Seems I am not the only one with bad luck.,"Got the same problem as the former reviewer. It worked fine for about 3-4 months. Then without any specfic reason, it started to freeze up my XP Pro whenever I want to copy anything bigger than 100-200M from my harddrive. I ran the system defragment, re-installed XP, changed from 1394 to USB2. Problem was still there. Sent an e-mail to the company, no response for over 4 weeks.Stay away from this!FYI, my system:HP pavilion ze 1230, AMD(m) 1400+, 512M, 20G. XP Pro SP1, with latest updates."
2,"well researched, plausable suspect for Jack the Ripper",This book gives plausable evidence that James Maybrick is in fact Englands Jack the Ripper. I found the book well researched giving insight in to the time and places when the Ripper roamed. The only shortcoming was that the diaries owner(s) for the past 100 years was not nailed down. The Book was also written in a technical manner making it hard to focus on all the facts given. I find it interesting to note that if this is The Diary of Jack the Ripper why it wasnt a bigger story worldwide at the time of its release?
1,Abysmal packaging and terrible customer service,"I received this item after a friend had purchased it from AMAZON. It was impossible to separate the small and large pushers. Then to add insult to injury there was no engraved serial number on the bottom. The 5 digit number on the sticker above was""not a valid serial number"" and I couldn't get the customer service person from Cuisinart to even give suggestions. I am not sure who is responsible, Cuisinart or Amazon, but the food processor is being returned."
1,Trainer ring doesn't fit every seat,"Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it."
2,"Great for High Schoolers, APUSH students, too.","We had a Clinton edition Presidents Fandex when my daughter was in grade school, and now her younger brother is in High School and is taking AP US History. The updated Obama edition is helping him memorize the presidents and dates for his class."
1,Poor Quality Control,"I'm afraid I wasn't able to judge the annoying alarm for myself, as the delivered unit had a cracked and crumbling case (the bottom is plastic), which was obviously done at the factory as the box and even the styrofoam was intact. The replacement unit just arrived, and has a broken temperature knob, again with no outside damage. So I'm sitting this one out and looking for another brand. Quality control counts, especially for an electrical product you'll expect to use for decades. Sorry Villaware, but I just can't trust it."
1,cute but not durable,"This is an attractive watch, but my daughter brought it home in pieces after her first day wearing it. It wasn't very comfortable, either."
2,Getting There,I listened to Kat's Cd while I was working at her college booking agency and I fell in love with her sound. I usually prefer male artists but Kat's music was such a pleasant surprise! She's definitely on to something here! It's only a matter of time before she is completely well known!
1,Dont Bother,"Dont even bother paying for or watching this film... reasons??? First of all i love the animated series and all the comics and in them SCOTT SUMMERS becomes the head of the institut and not storm. Scott also dose not die expeshally not from Jean. I was so dissaponted that they just killed scott in the begining and then it seemed like nobody even carde that he was dead or looked for him in that matter they just said 'SCOTTS DEAD"" end of it. Also i realise that Jean is powerful but wolverine killing her??? really??? Also lots of the characters are missing- Nightcrawler, Boom Boom, Emma Frost... where are they? Im hopping that this new movie X-men orogins: wolverine is a good movie or else i'll just stick to watching the animated versian of the X-Men. =)"
2,keeps characters and readers on their toes and guessing!,"Good and evil, dark and light swirl to gether to be become as gray as the wolf the graces the banners of house Stark. There are characters on all sides who I can't help rootingfore even though they are often on opposing sides. Of course, a character might swich causes at the next twist of the plot- you just never know. It is great!I also really enjoy the fantastic writing. I hope they put these books on audio *unabradged*!"
2,8th Season of 24,I had been waiting for the 8th season to become available. The 8th season of 24 was great. The only problem I had with the blueray was you had to have a blueray player capable of getting updates. With the updates current the disc played good. I think they left the ending open for a possible movie or 9th season. I hope it happens!!!!!
1,Not for GE Answering Machines,Seems to work as long as you don't let your GE Digital Answering machine take the call. This thing hangs it up! The Tech support from Privacy told me that this does not work with the GE machine.
1,These movies are terrible.,"I got this double feature for my boyfriend as a stocking stuffer. Boy oh boy, did we have a laugh over these... The movies are boring and ugly, reminiscent of everything that the '70s pooped out, and should not be taken seriously. The only redeeming feature of the features are the fact that they include Dobermans, but I wish there was more barkin' and less larkin' because both ""films"" make me want to chase my tail in frustration."
1,Too many Unskippable Ads,"There were around 30 minutes of ads at the beginning of the DVD for loads of kids movies, and we couldn't skip them!We finally got through them, but by that time, the kids' attention was lost. We never got to finish the DVD, and we're afraid to start it over again since we don't want to get into all those ads again!Other than that, the DVD is as advertised, and most of the episodes that we saw are still as fun and educational as when I was a kid.This looks like a great DVD for the kids, but watch out for the excessive marketing!"
1,I represented on of the shooters,"Mark Furman is so far off that it isn't funny. first of all I am a film producer. I had meetings in the 70's with the studio and the famous writer, Who wrote Martin Luther King movie. I story was so right on that everyone was afraid to deal with it. i can give you one name Robert Music an attorney in Los Angles or Orange County. I even had the pawn ticket of Harvey Oswald Rifle. He was a patsy. I'll bet you didn't know that it was a double team and I proved it. I can also prove were the shooter trained."
1,did not work for me,"Used it to the last drop, but I didn't fell any improvement. Not a bitNada. false claim? maybe."
1,Most boring movie of ALL TIME,"This big bad 3 hour movie has about five minutes of combat action in it. During which, the Japanese soldiers act like a bunch of cowards who surrender (!?!?!?) at the first hint of danger. George Clooney and John Travolta are each only given about two minutes in this humongous film. Buy it if you are an insomniac looking for a cure."
2,theory,very good school text for beginning theory and mathematics that pertain to the forces of gravity
1,Will not stay closed,The doors never stay closed NEVER. Find a better kitchen set. This one is a waste of your money. The doors open down so they just fall to the floor.
2,trimming,the Fiskars cutter did what it was supposed to. I used them on a sloping bank where I had planted flowers and placed rock. I needed something to trim around those items and my Fiskars did the job
2,"Fun, colorful, bubbly synthpop!","This is pretty much just pure fun. The songs evoke colorful pictures in your head, of flowers, butterflies and sunny days. It's not all that deep, so if you're looking for some introspection or commentary on modern society this isn't it. But if you want, light, fun, colorful music, or music you can dance to, this is it!Even a song called ""Miss Meloncholy"" isn't really sad. Songs such as ""Counting the Rosaries"" and "" Butterfly"" might even pass for children's songs. ""Alice Everyday,"" with a little bit harder guitars sound might be a fun party song, and ""Wall Song,"" which is mostly instrumental, has a gentle, waltzy beat.This might not be their very best, but it contains many enjoyable tracks and I'd recommend it if you're a fan of Book of Love, or of happy, colorful songs."
2,RoseArt Scented Markers,"I purchased two sets of these markers; one for myself and the other for a child's gift. I used mine within my classroom and the students loved them. My only complaint is they don't last near as long as Mr. Sketch Markers. If you compare the prices of the two, this was still a bargain."
2,Wonderful DVD,"We bought this DVD for two of our daughters for Christmas. They loved it. They were laughing so much at Quack, that it was hard not to laugh with them. I really like the way the shows are written, it presents the issues from a childs view which really helps them understand how things work and what causes things to happen. This DVD along with the other Peep and the Big Wide World DVD's are a wonderful and entertaining way to teach young children about science and the world around them."
2,Fifa,Game was in perfect condition! Easily able to play hours on hours of this game. The best fifa I have played. Go Liverpool!
1,Uneven toasting,"The original toaster did not toast on one side. Reolacement did work better, but toast is uneven. Looks good. Not worth the price. Could have gotten a better toaster for less money."
2,SERMONS BY TAYLOR,Great collection of sermons by an unusually gifted writer. Liked it so well trhat I have purchased from Amazon six additional copies for gifts.
1,not what you think,"bought 2, guess I will trash them. does not work in Bunn nor regular timed coffee pot. Would not buy again"
2,great playing strings,Prince Synthetic Gut:Great playing strings and easy to string with...perfect for any racket and great for intermediates to advanced if you like good power and touch!Ray Danganan in Frederick MD USRSA/USTA
2,SUMMERSLAM 2000!!,This is #25 out of 130 greatest WWE DVD's. This PPV holds the classic first ever TLC and a Triple Threat Match for the WWF Title.Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian is an awesome match that was brutal and it was the first of it's kind. Edge & Christian steal the tag titles away from the Hardyz.Kurt Angle vs. Triple H vs. The Rock was a great Triple Threat Match and the real issue was between HHH & Angle but still it was a great match with The Rock retaining his belt.This DVD overall is a classic and it is a must have for the TLC alone. There are some other pretty decent matches on this card.
2,Amazing movie,"this is one the best movies i've seen based by a book,it made me cry which when it comes tomovies it takes alot for me to do that.and i give 1000000000 thumbs up"
1,Builds fascinating layers and then collapses,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first 90% of this book. But then it was if if Vonnegut said, ""Well, better end this now"" and slapped on a contrived, simplistic, and extremely unsatisfying ending."
1,does not work!!!,Don't waste your time with this item. Its a huge sign when there are more negative than positive ratings. I had to return mine and get something else wasting a several days. Bad Belkin!
2,"Outstanding, gribbing, tale of epic portions.","After meeting him in person in South Africa just last week I found myself engrossed in the most dramatic piece of writing I have read since the Thorn birds. Nelson Mandela should be awarded the nobel prize for his achievements. Never in my life have I been taken more by a book, capivited by it's spirit, and enchanted by it's depth and simplicity."
2,The ONLY version!,"Always the best no matter how many other versions I have seen.In black and white ... it almost appears as if ""You Are There!"""
1,never buy it,"I bought this item from Amazon.It was in a non-working condition when i had it. The battery was dead. You are buying a new watch and it comes with a dead battery, very weird. You have to turn the crown in two different directions, at the position ""2"" to set the day and date. (""3"" to set the time, ""1"" normal position). One worked the other one did not for the watch i bought, so I could not change the day of the week. This was the second problem.I packed and returned it immediately, did not want to do anything for it.Buy any Citizen eco-drive watch, ten times more functional and better than this watch.By the way, I normally wanted to leave a zero star but that was not possible."
1,Wanted to like it so......,"Had always considered ""Emporer"" and 'Palace Thief"" to be two of most satisfying collections of short stories I've ever run across - so was terribly excited to read ""Kings and Planets"" and, like most of these reader reviews are stating, it just didn't work. Normally, I'd say - read it cause he's a brilliant writer, but if you know his stuff then save yourself from this disappointment. ALSO - what was the deal with the damn typeface? - there was this consistent extra space after a certain and often used word which now escapes me - let's just say - I put this whole experience out of my mind!!!!!"
2,"Fit Like... well, you know.","They are the best fitting gloves I've ever had. First time putting them on was a little awkward; a little snug. But they conformed almost immediately. They now fit like they were made for me; and so nicely warm and comfortable. I only wish the one for my right hand didn't seem to have little pin-pricks in the leather. They don't seem to go all the way through, and I've never had any issues with moisture or cold infiltrating it... It probably isn't even noticeable to others visually. It's just a nit-pick... I won't wear any other gloves than these for the forseeable future, that's for sure! Truly well made, and much better than Isotoner trash. This is the real deal, folks!"
1,Skip it!,My favorite part of this book is how the end of the chapter questions will ask you about concepts that were not even discussed. Badly written and confusing and cheap. If your professor uses this book consider switching classes!
1,"typical of its genre--long on ideas, short on reality","I thought this was a good deal like a lot of the wedding books I bought for my recent wedding. It has lots of cool ideas and much good information on wedding planning. What it *lacks* (like so many other books) is *any* sense of proportion: the sense that most brides are working with a limited budget and have limited time that they are willing to devote to the wedding planning. Come on--for most of us it's a wedding, not the invasion of Normandy! Perfectionistic princesses have enough wedding planners. What we need is one for the rest of us. The only book of that type I've seen is ""Weddings for Grownups,"" which I DO unconditionally recommend for all brides."
1,What Does JoJo Do With Her Music?,NOTHING! SHE DOES NOTHING WITH HER MUSIC!NO WONDER SHE BECAME A 1-HIT-WONDER!
2,For when love makes you sick to your stomache,"when you are on the verge of either crying or screaming, but you are not sure which one, and you cannot express with words how upset you are...this album will be the sweetest thing you have ever heard, and you will almost want to keep your broken heart simply because the beauty of this album turns the suffering into beautythe passion alone makes this album worth buyingbut to top it off, they express their passion perfectly with a new, breathtaking album that has stong infulences in hardcore punk and a unique guitar style that is a pleasure to listen tothis album thrives with its ability to elicit strong sentimental value, and almost impossible feat that every musician wished they could accomplishit is similar to being really thirsty and drinking a nice cold glass of waterit is also very energetic and your sorrows seem to drownd out in the sea of musical intensity Fear Before the March of Flames have created in this albumit is awesome"
1,Poor customer and technical support by Atari short change this game,"This game has great potential. However, Atari falls FAR short of any reasonable mark in supporting this game. One of my children originally lost the box with the game key. Atari was zero help, saying I must buy another copy of it to play it. Sadly, I did. Later, when I upgraded to Vista, Atari informed me it did not work with Vista and no patches were planed. It has since sat useless on my shelf for 2 years now. I will never purchase another Atari game/software after this experience. How you make a PC based game and do not patch it to keep pace with the latest operating system is beyond me."
1,Unhappy with this!,"I tried to cancel this order, but your software would not let me do that. You should reveiw your software."
1,These beats are taken from other stuff,"I think that this CD is a waste of Money. Sasha is a great DJ...look at the Northern Exposure series. This CD does has good beats none of which are original, I am beginning to think that this Global Underground series isn't any good, Look at Pual Okanfold, his beats stay the same this is hardly Techno/House, not even Progressive House. I think a great CD series, is the ICU sessions, with Kimball Collins (ICU session 1), & Dimitry (ICU session 3)(also where sasha got the beat for tracks 3-4 ondisk 1). I think Sasha can do MUCH better"
2,"Great Read, Not a True Story!","While the tale of a team of gamblers taking down a famous casino in Monte Carlo is an engaging story, here's the problem: The gambling system described is simply not possible.When I read the book, I had my father write a program to simulate 100,000 spins of a roulette wheel, using each of the gambler's moves (the outcome of the spin affects each team member differently).It took about 5 seconds on this massive computer (at Abbott Laboratories) to re-create 100,000 spins. Results weren't even close to making money. We ran it again, several times, same outcome.I then had him invert the program, that is reverse the logic revealed by Leigh's system. Maybe, I figured, the author was altering his strategy to hide the real method.Back to the computer, back to the same results - nothing that amounts to winning money.Cash in on good readaing from a fun older book, but don't get your hopes up to make a living off a the author's gaming system."
1,Boring to a Tee,"Boring, boring, boring,. Donna Jo Napoli's Bound was completly boring. Basically, Bound is a Chinese Cinderella story complete with stepmother and a missing slipper. Although it was interesting to learn ancient Chinese customs, the story was just a little too out there. For instance, Xing-xing who is the main character/Cinderella, befriends a carp fish whom she believes is her mother reincarnated as a fish. Near the end of the story, her family eats that fish and Xing-Xing is crushed. What the heck! Are we supposed to feel sorry for her? The author also describes things in way too much detail. Or at least the unimprtant things in detail. Bound was also breeching risque in that certain things are described as ""sexy"" and there are ""erotic pictures"" on medicane jars. It's as if Napoli wanted to write an adult novel and wound up writing children's literature instead. So if you're looking for a sappy, melencholy Cinderella story than be my guest. If not, don't even try."
2,Tool never disappoints,"This is an incredible album. The music is great, and it is emotionally very powerful as well. But then what else would you expect from one of the best bands of all time?Do yourself a favor and DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS ALBUM!Not only are the majority of the ""10,000 Days"" tracks that you will find on the P2P networks not even from this album, but Tool deserves the money. And as always, the album cover is a work of art."
2,Simply works for Dell Dimension 8400,"I Upgraded my old Dell Dimension 8400 Desktop from its original 1GB RAM (2 Sticks of 512mb) to 4 GB Ram (4 Sticks of 1GB). Although this is not the same brand that came in the Dell Dimension, the PNY Branded RAM works just fine. I am able to run windows 7 and various memory consuming applications such as Autocad fairly well on the old desktop.There not very much to say about RAM, because it is what it is; either it works or it doesn't.If you are purchasing for a Dell Dimension 8400 I can confirm it does work well.As always I try to write helpful insightful reviews for every purchase i make here on amazon.comGood luck!"
1,not a very good toy to play with,"we got this as a gift for our dd. she didn't have any interest in it at all. even after she learned how to kick it...it didn't stay in place long enough for her to keep kicking it. also, you had to really hit it hard in order to get it going. the music was very loud and annoying. the first time she heard the music it scared her. the only plus side to it is that it can fold up nicely and be put away. definitly not worth to buy. i'm glad i got this as a gift and didn't buy it."
1,"euthanasia, please, over this book","Ursula K. LeGuin -- genius, or Scotch warming pan? The distinction becomes blurred sixty pages into the book, when LeGuin decides to give your human sensibilities such a thorough rogering that you only wish you had run for magistrate of Gornoth Sector-7 to condemn the alien spice-fiend who has apparently taken over Ms. -LeGuin's- sensibilities to life in a boldronathian vector jumble. What in the name of heaven is Earthsea? Where is the plot? Has postmodernism become prehistoricism? This is not a book. It's words on a pages between two covers fashioned from the most typical of sci-fi novel cover-stock paper. LeGuin's writing is so poor that it seems to legitimise every Tor Science Fiction series novel every written, but as to exactly how, well, i'm not sure, but my guess it has something to do with the space-time continuum, hill-gnomes, and ""dark wizardry."" And vector jumbles. Rubbish."
1,Ick Ick Ick!,"I am really sorry. But this song is really just a bunch of balony. ""I don't want no scrub""? You can't even understand them. Those artificial babes really need a kick in the head. The Spice Girls are better than TLC! Ick everyone! Get in the now! Reality Check!"
1,Bring Out Your Dead T-Shirt,Ordered a medium. Wasn't even close to that size. Had to reorder a large so that the recipient would be able to wash and dry it without fear that it would be a size small after the first trip through the laundry. Wasn't worth the extra postage on top of the original shipping charges to send it back.
2,A monumental work from an American scholar,"Francis X. Winters has written what the Vietnamese both in Viet Nam and the overseas have been saying for decades. The only differences between the Vietnamese version versus Winters' is that he had unearth rare documents and conducted fascinating interviews to support his claim. There are many books about Viet Nam; however, ""The Year of the Hare"" stands alone from 1963-1964."
2,I really liked this movie,"If you enjoy film then you will truly enjoy this one: a very witty comedy in the vein of ""Swingers"" meets ""Diner"" meets ""My favorite Year"". Shatner is absolutely hilarious!(and I hated Star Trek) and Weigel and MacCormack have chemistry much like Favreau and Vaugn in ""Swingers"". Independent all the way but with commercial appeal."
2,Redwall,"First of all let me say I quite enjoyed the book. If you are completely new to the Redwall series you should know that it is basically an epic tale about war between several types of animals. This is in every book in the Redwall Series!Now you shouldn't shun this book just because it deals with a slightly childish topic. All characters have a near human personality and either have your heartfelt compassion or solid dislike. Now I don't want to go into to much detail, but the story follows the general plot of everyone being happy, bad things happen, good vs. bad, good guys win. The book also has a few flaws. The story has a sort of repeating tone to it, meaning that is sometimes gets a little boring.Overall I gave this book a 4/5 since it is intriguing yet dull in certain areas. Check out the book for yourself and see how you like it."
1,Counterfiet/knock-off/fake/not real,"Everything-On-Go sold me FAKE product!!!I ordered (4) Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray. What they sent was NOT the real thing.From the first spray I knew something was wrong because it smelled very different than the Stud 100 I have used before.4 of: Stud 100 Male Genital Desensitizer Spray, 7/16- Fl. Ounce Box [Health and Beauty]Condition: NewSold by: Everything-On-Go (seller profile) $3.99Perhaps the $3.99 price should have been my first warning that I would not get the REAL thing. Buyer beware!!!"
2,Fine First Person Account - Most Interesting,"I really enjoyed this book. Charlie Siringo sure seems like a typical irresponsible cowboy that you read about. One is struck as the scrapes he gets into, how he gets out, how he survives, and his absolute innocence. He lays it out up front: ""I wrote this book to make a lot of money"". I don't know about the money but he sure wrote a great book. I love the window into the people of the late 1800's, yes even Billy the Kid, and how the world worked then.He was not a professional writer at that time, and his writing is fresher because of it. He is especially not a ""modern"" writer with all the psychobable, self interest, and narcissim.You will live a bit of the real old west with Charlie. I highy recommend this book. I plan to read his Pinkerton Detective years, and others."
1,The worst yet,"Whatever happened to the thrillers Mr. Grisham used to write? The last two books of his have done nothing for me, I guess I am expecting the same kind of excitement as in ""The Firm"" ""Pelican Brief"", etc."
2,"Cannibal, the Musical","This movie has got to be the funniest most original musical I have ever seen. It is silly, funny, and the songs will leave impressions in your mind long after the movie ends. I have re-rented this movie three times which is more than I can say for any other movie I have ever seen except one."
2,Class Album - Thanx,"Macca B - From the 80'sClassic Midlands Reggae, from a great era!Need I Say More?"
2,Beatles meets The Kinks . . .,"Twin Cinema is pop, punk and rock woven together into a very interesting (and fun to listen to) album. Several different singers and styles lend enjoyable variety, and many of the tunes are so catchy they stay with you (in a good way--not akin to ""It's a Small World""). I didn't feel that the end of the album was as strong as the beginning, but it's still growing on me, so I may change my mind."
1,Some band names are so DOG-AWFUL . . .,". . . I would never want their music as part of my CD collection. Marcy Playground. Mr. Mister. Uncle Cracker. Band names are really unimportant and I usually don't put much stock in them. But ""Dogs Die in Hot Cars"" is the worst band name I've ever heard. Absolutely dispicable. This band could be the new Beatles and I'd never buy their music. They should be embarassed."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased these on June 27th and, unfortunately I did not open the box and start using them until late July. Within 1/2 days, the left side went out, and just the right side works. When I went online to see about returning them, it was out of the time frame and according to the warranty(which I admit to not reading before purchasing), even if I was in the allotted time slot, would only be eligible for 50% of my money back. Sigh. Word to the wise, open electronics immediately!!!"
1,Jelbrown,"I purchased two Zen V Plus as Christmas gifts. One the screen does not display and the other freezes often. When the players work like they should it was great but I spent too much money for both products to cause so much trouble within 6 months of purchase. I've tried to firmware updates often and one player will have to be returned for a fee. I would not recommend this product to anyone due to the numerous problems so soon. Based on other reviews, I'm experiencing common problems."
1,Watery,This is a watered down fake bottle of Biosilk. The real one is thicker and smells a lot better than this one.
2,Fabulous but brief and not chronological,"After seeing this fabulous movie I knew I HAD to have this score! The music is delightful and full of fantasy and beauty. My main bones to pick are that the tracks are aranged haphazardly, and that many fabulous pieces are missing! I have my fingers crossed for another album ""MORE music from Peter Pan"" but sadly I doubt this will be a reality.Favorite pieces are definitly ""Fairy Dance"", ""Set Them Free"", ""I Do Believe in Fairies"", and ""Peter Returns"".James Newton Howard is also the composer of Atlantis:The Lost Empire by Walt Disney Studios, and as with all noted composers, traces of his previous work appear in his current (this is not a bad thing!)"
1,Machinery's Handbook (CD-ROM),"I was very disappointed with this CD. I loaded the CD onto the hard drive of my laptop, registered the CD on line, and was then denied access to the contents of the CD. I had to unlock each and every chapter of the book contained on the CD on the Machinery's Handbook website. I do not recommend anyone to purchase this CD! I refer to this handbook a lot in the field and I am always looking for ways to lighten the load. Last I checked, I can still refer to the handbook from the hard drive of my lap top, but it's been several days."
1,Truly Disappointed,"The authors propensity for villains with schizophrenia or MPDand carrying multiple story lines in a single book is just getting old.The story jumps around so much that it becomes quite hard to follow.The plot is murky and although I don't mind foreshadowing I don't liketo be beaten to death with it (telling us someone's going to die once isthrilling, more than that and it loses its impact and almost becomesinsulting ""ok, I GET it they're going to die, get on with the story.""). Icame across Ghoul a few years ago in a used book shop and wasenthralled now I'm just disappointed and doubt I'll read or buy furtherbooks from this author and that saddens me."
1,reevaluation of my review,"since I wrote my last review I have broken two of my 36"" cabinet master clamps. the pot metal in the head shattered when I hand tightened them. My advice is stay away from these clamps."
1,Disappointed,The setup and initialization was easy and quick. However the transfer time and print time from computer to blue-tooth printer is awful. It's not worth the money even at the great price.
1,A Real Snoozer,"Hard to believe that someone could take one of the most dramatic events of the twentieth century and make it this mind-numbingly boring. Written with an overly verbose, convoluted style, it just never seemed to get to the point. NOTE to future authors: three page end notes have a name - THEY'RE CALLED CHAPTERS. The text reads like a caricature of a blabbering communist from an old movie from the Fifties in Hollywood."
1,Tossing it in the Garbage,"I couldn't agree more with the previous review that you get what you pay for with this vacuum. I bought it because of the low price & am now shopping for a new vacuum (it won't be Eureka) since I am tired of being able to only use it for a few minutes at a time before smoke starts coming out of it. The directions didn't state that you have to lower the top part of the vacuum first every time you change the carpet settings so as a result I've got a vacuum cleaner that's worthless. When I called customer service the first time this happened (just after the 1 year warranty expired), I found out I was not the only owner to have this problem. Since it would cost me more to get the engine fixed that to just buy a quality vacuum, I'm looking for a good vacuum with a warranty that is longer than 1 year. My theory, thanks to this vacuum, is that if a company will only warranty their vacuum for 1 year, the company must already know it's not a very good, or reliable, product."
2,Great for the Price,"This dresser is very nice once assembled. Assembly does take some time but it's rather straight forward. It's much smaller than I anticipated but that's my own fault for not looking at the dimensions. Bottoms of drawers are not nearly as flimsy as other reviews make them out to be, just make sure you assemble them correctly and I put glue on them to ensure stability. Overall it is a great dresser for the price but could stand to be a bit wider."
2,An Enchantment,"This book is an enchantment and, in the able hands of author Ian Baker, the land Herself the mighty sorcerer. Baker tells us just enough about the odd mix of pilgrims to make our travels flavor-full, but not so much as to distract us from the main characters, the sacred landscape and her culture, perhaps as they will never be viewed again. Good job! In fact, great job! I've always wanted to travel to Tibet, climb the mightiest mountains, and experience the soul of a raging river. What a fulfilling journey this is...While we never really go through the lama's doorway at the back of the waterfall, that was understandably not Baker's sacred purpose here. Our vision has now experienced serious practice and holy inspiration. For any reader left wanting, I recommend R. Alan Fuller's tale of shamanic initiation (and entry through such portals) at 17,000 foot elevation at Marcawasi (Peru), as related in his book ""High Holy Adventure""."
2,Illustrated Man,"""Listen, Keep your ears clean, smell the smells of a rocket. Feel. Remember. So when you return you will talk of it all the rest of your lives."" The Illustrated Man should be required reading. Author Bradbury, Ray well organized eighteen tales, fill with life questions and answers. Although most of the stories were not carrying a person along, however it gave an astonished notion to people. The way he forecasted the future was closely related to the present world. It was also startled that he had thought of this concept and idea before 55 years ago. After finishing the novel, it made me surprise of the prodigy idea and richness words of Bradbury.I have an opinion that The Illustrated Man should be all state required books for all teens. I think it brings new views of teens about the coming generation."
1,DO NOT BUY,LCD screen will not respond. Sony will charge aprox. $200.00 to repair. It's not a bad camera but only lasted a few months past the warrenty. Also is difficult to transfer tapes to disc. Not compatable with most PC's. If you only need the camera for a year or so this one is fine. If you want one that will last don't purchase!!
1,Yoga Sutras,"While the book itself is in good shape, it had writing in it in several places...would have liked to know that"
1,item under review,I was interested in this item. I read one or two reviews about the knifes not fitting the block or not coming with the correct amount of knives.I think the problem is the wrong block is being used.[...]the knives are good but sent with wrong block if im correct.
2,Love Killing Season,Two Seattle detectives set out to solve the murder of a young girl. The series unfolds in a realistic manner -- one episode is one day. Believable characters and situations. Highly recommend.
1,Lacking and Misleading Title,"Bought this DVD for my Mahalia Jackson collection. And much to my dismay, there were only 2 very brief segments devoted to the Greatest MJ (not the KOP). To add insult to injury, both segments showed the identical performance; NOT the performance on the cover at all. Very misleading cover. Other gospel artists were great but I purchased this b/c of Mahalia. Beware."
2,"Boundaries, And the roles children are cast in",This book gives an overview of roles children are often placed in by parents who are overwhelmed by life or are lacking self awareness or are just plain negligent. The detrimental effects these roles can have on children are defined. Healthy boundary development is addressed in great detail through step by step recommendations and examples illustrating lack of boundaries and implementation of boundaries.The Intimacy Factor coupled withThe Feeling Good Handbookwere really helpful to me in my healing.I would have given it five stars except some of the descriptions used at the beginning of this book are a bit convoluted.
1,MEDIOCRE,"Alejandro Sanz must be one of the most overrated singer songwriters ever to have broken sales records in any country. After selling over 2 million copies of ""Mas"" in Spain on the strength of ""Corazon Partio"" and ""Y,Si Fuera Ella"",two songs which could hardly be described as innovative or ground breaking,Sanz returns with an album that resembles a collection of B sides and outtakes from ""Mas"". Forget the hype...neither is ""Mas"" a""Seargeant Peppers"" of Latin pop,nor is ""El Alma Al Aire"" anything more than a collection of second rate formula Italo-ballads sung by an artist whose tremendous success in Spain is based upon the fact that in that country the more mediocre the album, the more sales it generates... One listen to any album by Camela will more than justify this point. If you're looking for some cool,unpretentious latin pop,go buy yourself Paulina Rubio's hugely entertaining ""Paulina"" CD and enjoy!!!"
1,High Maintenance and messy..,"The vaccum has good suction.. I was very happy with the suction and it worked like a charm for awhile. I had to tear the thing apart several times just to remove clogs... no fun but it still worked fine. Now, only after 8 months of having the thing, the motor blew. I mean it really blew.. smoke bellowing out of the thing and all.After doing bunches of research, it seems that many vaccum manufacturers make their vaccums intentionally to only last about a year. I will now be moving to a Dyson DC07. It is the cheapest of the dysons and it has a 5 year manufacturer warranty. All I have heard is good things about customer support also. In the long run, this is a much better financial decision instead of going with cheap vaccums every year.Sorry Bissell, another unhappy customer here."
1,2 defective products from the seller,"This was purchased and then sent back as defective at my expense. The replacement was also defective. I am now working with Motorola's warranty department and going on a month without . To their credit, Amazon assisted in the replacement."
1,Kindle New York Times costs too much,I'm not willing to spend over $200 for a newspaper. The NYT needs to drop their price closer to $60/yr.
1,holy cow,mother of god why would anyone pay that price? i just watched a million episodes on tv yesterday for free (not including the monthly cable bill).
1,ok,it was a good story in the beginning but then started to get boring. The characters were just like stick\s walking around going to places. it was not a fun book to read. i didn't enjoy it much. do not read it and read the book Hoot instead!
2,Great Book,"Great book to read if you are interested in living a healthier, more compassionate, cleaner, and greener life. This book is a good place to start."
2,Champ at cleaning the exterior windows,I bought this to clean the windows of my truck while traveling across country. The product is great! It makes the glass water repellent and easier to clean after application.A couple hints:Use the gas station scrubber to get the big stuff first.Spray the Rain X Cleaner and clean with paper towels.Follow up with a damp microfiber cloth to polish the glass.
2,JAG,Hoping one day to own the total series. Love watching all the old movies and hoping that the two of them get together..
1,One of the Better Bond films - One of the WORST Bond Scores,"The title of this review sums it up. Looking at the score/soundtrack track by track, with the following rating scheme that I use for all of my soundtracks (I have all of the James Bond soundtracks in my collection) **** = Exceptional, *** = Very Good, ** = Good, * = Fair/OK, X = Poor/TurkeyTrack and rating01: *02: **03: X04: *05: X06: *07: X08: **09: *10: X11: X12: **13: (first half up to appx 1:35 is X, second half is **)14: X15: **16: X"
1,Couldn't get into this show,Sorry I just could not get into this. I'm not one for unrealistic shows. Just too unreal for me. And at most I can say I gave this a shot.
2,Power of soul,"These guys are not trying to prove anything and yet the jazz funk they lay down is so hip, so chill in-the-pocket you just have to be glad you made the discovery - for vague comparison Lonnie Liston Smith comes to mind (though this is less spacey and has no vocals), or a more sophisticated variety of some 70s blaxploitation soundtrack. 1974 was a primo year for this kind of thing. It's very funky, but almost as mellow as the opening musical sequence of the 70s TV show ""Taxi"" (which I happen to dig) - OK that's a slight exaggeration, but this is a very mellow AND funky CD. Hands down recommended, especially at the current price."
2,My daughter has loved it since she was a newborn,"I recieved this at my baby shower. My daughter has loved it since the day I brought her home from the hospital. She listens to it every night when she goes to bed. She would always smile when i would turn it on when she was just a few weeks old, even if she was sleeping. Now she is 9 months old and still loves it. It is easy fopr her to turn on and make the little star fish move. She will sit and pay with it for quite some time"
1,Beware of the porn!,Watched this with my 13 year old and now he's pissed because I took it away due to the porno scene. To bad these yahoo's can't make a skate video for everyone. They feel they needed a scene of some chick giving head to some dude. What's with that?
1,Cold Salsa,"Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD. It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years. Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next. One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever. Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it. The rest of the CD is throw away. But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money. It's the only reason I gave this album two stars! If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store ""Pronto!""."
1,Don't think its supposed to catch on fire,"So I ordered this figuring its a simple tool with a simple purpose, why pay more than $3 or so.... well, open the package, notice the plug doesnt quite look the same as your standard American plug. Plug it in, put a glue stick in it... after 20 seconds or so, I was about to pick it up, when sparks started shooting out of it. Sparks flying from the trigger and any hole in the plastic. I yanked the plug out of the outlet before my fuses blew or something, and the glue gun had smoke coming out of it. I threw it out the window before my house burned down.Please don't buy this. Its terrible crap made in terrible Asian factories and isn't compatible with USA electricity. Serious risk to buyers."
1,Not an Upgrade!,"This is not an upgrade for all Dreamweaver MX owners. I own Studio MX, which includes Dreamweaver MX. This upgrade does not support upgrades for software collections like Studio. When they say, ""Dreamweaver MX, 2004, 8"" they mean only these products. The worst part is Adobe doesn't point this out until after you've tried to install it!Try returning an opened software package. Thank's Adobe for wasting my time and money."
1,Don't buy this watch,"This is a beautiful design, but the workmanship is terrible. The watch fell off my wrist within ten minutes -- the clasp is worthless -- AND the watch face popped off when it hit the carpet. Please."
1,Boring,"I just wanted to get my 1 star recorded as payback to this movie for wasting my time, although I did start doing other things halfway through. The only positive thing I can say is that the actor portraying Blevins, the third wheel, did a fine job. When he wasn't onscreen I was wondering what he was up to and wishing I could be spending my time with him, instead of the other two dullards we are unfortunately stuck with. Penelope Cruz adds zero to the movie. Don't know if it's due to editing or acting and don't really care. Can you tell i'm disgusted? If you're a movie fan or a western fan you should be too."
1,Alarm Remotes,"The alarm functions works well with this item, but I ordered a new one from Amazon just to get two new remotes. The remotes tend to break at the loop for the key chain, and the entire alarm is less expensive then the two remote controls would cost to replace. I broke both of the originals in about 3 years and I don't see any change in the design so I suspect these will last about the same. 1-2 years each."
2,Rotisserie experience,I recently purchased my Weber at a yard sale for $15!!!!! I was so excited I went online to search for a rotisserie and found the best deal at Amazon.com I am extrememly happy with the product...
2,Her best album,"Janet Jackson's best album by far! It all seems so old-school now, but still great music with then ground-breaking rhythm, style mixing, and lyrics. Good stuff!"
2,Welch¿s Long-lasting Contribution to Business Leadership,"Jack Welch, although the most well known CEO in Corporate America for decades, is going beyond his own myth in his autobiography. He has decided to get a better hold of his destiny by explaining himself to readers. Welch shares with his audience some very interesting insights about his personality and management style that he has developed over time: self-confidence, self-respect, trust, toughness and aggressiveness as well as warmth and generosity. Welch, a star performer, realistically played the promotion game to climb to the top of GE. As CEO of GE for two decades, Welch proved many detractors wrong by turning a stodgy, bureaucratic manufacturing conglomerate into a very profitable, service-oriented constellation of companies sharing the same vision and values. Welch probably knows better than anybody else that the work of his life is unfinished business. Business is indeed a process of constant renewal."
2,Sills delightful,"Sills' impeccable French makes her singing in that language something worth hearing. Her interpretation is impeccable but for the fact that this recording was taped fairly late in her career and you can sense some strain in her voice. Still, it is an experience to share."
1,Not worth the silence,"The price, space and product is not worth it. It is silent but it removes very little from the air and plus if you open a door or window..poof the stuff out of the air is back. I have puppies and wanted to get rid of their fur on my clothes. This product did absolutely nothing for it. I bought a loud air filter and that seems to work better because it sucks in all the air. But it is loud!"
2,Great game,"I played this game 5 years ago, and decided to play it again, and i'm happy to say that it's still a great game!What I liked most about the game is the story, and also the characters and their relationship with eachother. The music is good, graphics is good, character models are good, the menue system for using psyic powers and regular weapons is easy to sift through, the voice acting is great, and one main thing that stood out in the game is the fact that I could play though the main character's flash backs (as opposed to just viewing a character's past memories and flash back sequences through cut scenes) as he try to piece together what happened to him and his companions. It's an overall solid game that's a lot of fun to play. I olny wish the team that put this game together was still making them like this. It was a fun play for me."
2,Wonderful Product,"I have been struggling with a flimsy cart for four years. In fact, I relegated it to my closet because rolling it around was impossible. Not only that, it began to rust almost immediately. This cart is perfect and VERY high quality. It goes together smoothly, is well designed and already has helped with the laundry. I also like the fact that you can wash the canvas pockets easily. Comparable carts were too expensive. I went for a Bed and Bath one that was inexpensive but poorly made. Thank goodness I found this one. The hanging bar is a wonderful innovation and the idea that you can actually adjust it brilliant.I'd give it 6 stars out of 5."
1,"Decent TV, Terrible Customer Service - Update","The TV works fine, but the remote didn't work from day 1. I called Philips* they made me copy and fax my receipt* wait two weeks for a confirm number* package the remote and mail it back at my expense ($8).* I still don't have a remote - 2 months after purchase.Update - 6 weeks after mailing in my broken remote (that was broken when it came out of the box) - I rec'd the same broken remote mailed back to me today. I jumped through every hoop imaginable and they just mailed it back. Avoid Philips at all cost.UPDATE - After finally replacing the remote at my own cost, I enjoyed the TV for about 10 months until the video component went out. I still have audio, but no picture which kind of defeats the purpose of have a teleVISION. I called Philips and was told (like the others) that the TV is not under warranty and I could purchase a refurb unit for $299. I'll never buy from Philips again."
1,let go of all your jealousy,"I found this album to be nothing more that a man trying too hard to be Jimmy Buffett. I also think that Mr. Burns should let go of his jealousy of Buffett's success. As far as te music goes, some of the songs were good, but others were pretty lame, only Jimmy Buffett himself can write those types of songs with consistent quality"
1,Wrong TOOL for the job?,"I'm a long time TOOL fan... so there was a reason why I didn't and haven't bought any PERFECT CIRCLE albums, which is pretty much the exact opposite why so many people DID by APC albums. Well, I finally borrowed this from a friend and I was right, it's just a fat strip of jerky, when you really need the steak. Musically, it's not bad... but it ain't nuthin groundbreaking... And, by no means is this the greatest album of all time... To me, I just can't see how, when these guys are ""Rockin' Out"", they aren't sayin' to themselves, ""yeah, this is just like TOOL... Heavy, Yeah... we rock!"" Even if TOOL's guitar tech started the band, I don't care, too many Adam Jones elements in there to be considered original. And the lighter stuff is just nu-metalish wankery... And to top it all off, the whole ""Supergroup"" thing is just a little much. Maynard, please... round up the boys and blow our minds again..."
2,GREAT PRODUCT.,the shield is easy to install and works great. I used to scrape frost off my girls cars for 10 minutesand now 2 seconds to remove the screen.
2,Wilton 21004 Columbian 4 inch X 7inch Woodworkers Vise,"I have only used this vise a couple of times and so far it has performed up to my expectations. I was pleased to find out that the package contained the magnetic hardwood jaw inserts (these were a $30.00 option in another catalog I shopped in). The only problem I have with this item is that the name WILTON is clearly visible on the vise body in the Amazon ad. photo but the vise I received had no indication on the vise that it was a Wilton vise, only the packaging and instructions contained the Wilton name. I guess only time will tell if this vise will live up to the Wilton name or if I received a substandard imitation."
1,"inexpensive, and you get what you pay for in this case","Seems like a reasonable razor for the money, but as good shaver it leaves a bit to be desired. Even with the new blade, and foil I feel like I'm begging it to cut. The surface is very narrow, and rattles against your face. I'll give them credit for producing a razor at this price, but I should have spent a bit more and gotten something that does a better job."
1,Mountain Survivor's Guide,"The first word I said when I finished this book in one day since its only 126 pages was ""finally."" This was probabally the worst book anyone could ever read. Trust me, if your looking for a good read dont even look at this book. I know I might be harsh but, this book, quite frankly, Stinks. No facts, just a test that you would rather skip, then get an E, which I give this book, with an A+ being the best and and E, being the worst."
2,GREAT READ!,"This book is truly awesome! I have read it every year since 1997, and still look forward to reading it more. Although Goldman's little inserts get pretty annoying from time to time, he writes it in a font that you can skip over if you wish. I am truly glad that Goldman decided to edit this book, otherwise, i don't think anyone would be able to get through it! The movie follows the book very closely, but the book gives more detail and background about Fezzik and Inigo! This is my favorite book, and i hope you all enjoy it as well!"
2,alive and kick'n,"I have a decent size and selection of instrumental virtuoso cds and I would say that Marty's recent releases have continued to be better than the majority of his colleages. I've completely stopped buying steve vai (sorry to say) due to the obvious dullness,flat and uninspired artsy fartsy stuff he's been delivering. But, thats not the case with Marty's recent releases. They rock"
2,Great Little Vac,"This is the best small vacuum I've ever tried. It'd be wonderful if one could get this kind of power in a cordless, but the length of the cord for this model makes it virtually the same. Great at pet hair, great for quick cleanups almost anywhere. If you remember that it's a small vacuum, and not a biggie with a big bag, you'll be very happy with this gem. Best small power cleaning purchase I have ever made."
1,Has No Range,"I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
1,I DON'T LIKE IT (It needs a negative review),"I don't like this album, it is extremely boring. I'm not holding it to comparison to anything prior by Amon Tobin. I don't like it because I found myself fast fowarding through parts in search for something more.I wanted the grass to get greener and this was never the case. I also search for something in music that I might enjoy, or even a singular sound that I can sample and exploit.This album failed to entertain me, or make me feel energized. Even with the hope of discovering some cool sounds it is a total let down."
1,This is not Sonicflood,"What a crushing blow to finally get the CD, shred the wrapping, jam it in and then you'll find out something is wrong. This is not Sonicflood in every sense of the word and is false advertising to even call this a Sonicflood release. Every member of the ""band"" is new, not a single original member can be found. My advice is to pass on the disc and get the new Kevin Max or Michael Tait CDs instead. Get the 2 CD Delirious disc, just don't be fooled by this CD."
1,Extremely disappointing!,"The movie was a complete waste of time! It's the kind of movie that leaves a bitter taste after you watched it. It's all doom and gloom. I really tried to watch it with an open mind, hoping that it will turn better, but there was nothing positive about it. Human misery at it's finest!"
1,Lucas must be banished!,"""There will be no burning here today! We will banish him!"" A cute line from ""Highlander."" It is quite appropriate for the current state of Star Wars affairs."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,I read the sequel to this book{A Warrior's Kiss} before I read this one and it was much better. I was really disappointed with Dylan and Genevieve's story. Ms. Moore made me hate Dylan and then had Dylan's ex-mistress{supposedly able to see the future} tell Genevieve that she was barren and Dylan believed her. In the end Dylan decided that he wanted Genevieve even if she was barren but by the end of the story I wondered why Genevieve would want him! If you are looking for a happy ending with a story that makes you feel good at the end...this is not the book for you. I ended the book feeling like I wasted my money on a story that left me feeling sad!
1,Garbage,"This version of these games is garbage. BEWARE! Don't buy other games from Destination Software or Gravity-I. I bought this game so I could play Risk with friends, but can I? NOPE! You can only play against the computer. There is NO REASON they could not have programmed the game on Game Boy Advance so that you could play against other HUMAN players, and the computer opponents are so stupid the game isn't fun to play. Also, there is no save option(a common problem with GBA games and I'm tired of it.). These are ROTTEN versions of great board games. I wouldn't recommend doing business with the aforementioned companies in the future."
1,YUCK,"Other than the first track, CARESS OF STEEL, this is a limp cd. Two over drawn out rock operas, and, besides Carress, not a decent stand alone song on this waste of money. This one a very few bad rush cds."
2,Works fine for me.,"I have been using a Belkin G USB adapter for about a year. It has worked fine with the supplied CD on Windows ME and XP and three different Ubuntu Linux installations. John Flynn, Tucson"
1,IHeritage by Celtic Thunder,"When I recieved "":Heritage"", by Celtic Thunder from Amazon It did not play' I had ordered two other Celtic Thunder cd's at the same time and there was no problem with them, I ordered another ,it did not play; I odered one more' that did not play, so I have given up.I am a big Celtic Thunder fan and hope to one day find a ""Hertitage"" that will work."
2,quiet and easy to use,These clippers are quiet and easy to use. They are comfortable in the hand and work well.
2,Worth reading - make sure you read the series in order.,What a great way to leave the work world. Let Mr Lumley wisk you off into an environment of deadly make believe. Lots n' lots of plot. Riverting characters. Down right frightning!!!! Make sure you read the series in order!
1,The worst travel guide ever!,"This is not one of the worse but THE worst travel guide ever!!! I am someone who has traveled extensively worldwide, including throughout Italy, and I used this guide in my recent trip to Sicily (I just came back), which was the only place in Italy where I hadn't been before. The person who wrote this guideFrommer's Sicily (Frommer's Complete)has no judgement and apparently had never traveled before in his life in order to be able to appreciate what is worth visiting and what is not. This guide is not only misleading but it is also full of inaccurate information --enough to send you to the wrong places on the wrong days and times (e.g., wrong hotel addresses; wrong opening days and hours for museums, etc)."
2,long live the mu empire,great movie - good transfer - but a little washed out - the contrast/black levels are kinda weak - but any serious toho fan should own this
2,Excellent product for it's price.,This product really does what many others do but with far less of their costs. Would for sure purchase again though it looks it will last for a long time. Great product.
1,Yikes,I was looking for a light-hearted good read and came across Mr. Maybe . I almost stopped reading part way because I disliked the main character so much. I finished the book and found it utterly predictable.
2,Highly Recommended!,"very good quality phones they're crystal clear, have great bass mids and highs don't worry if the high end sounds a little laid back at first, it opens up after some burn-in very natural sounding and nice fold up design definitely the best headphones under $100!"
1,Buy something else by Deepak - this is just a quick interview,This video is just a quick interview about his book. It is not worth buying considering all the other video's and DVD's that he has out that are great. Nothing much is gained from this video BUT MUCH IS GAINED BY READING THE BOOK!
2,Perfect for the jouney of love......,"This album was backtracked by myself, as I live in London UK, there is no maket for U.S. freestyle here.This album basically takes you through the journey of love - first, it kicks you off with a 80s party tune (which puts u in a good mood). The second, in my opinion, is one of his top five tunes. If you are infatuated with someone, this song says it all - mindblowing. The next few tracks seem to be of a heartbreaking mood. The rest of the tunes are worth listening to over and over but trax 2 & 5 are worth getting the whole album for alone!"
2,Surprisingly good,"As I am not enamored with the private life of Woody Harrelson, I usually skip his movies.I watched this one because I saw the trailer on another indie movie.Glad I did. Worth watching."
1,What's that smell? Oh . . . it's cheese.,"This ""film"" was a painful experience from start to merciful finish. This movie was Copland, Boyz in the Hood, and Colors rolled into one film of far lesser value. If you are looking for a well written and interesting ""action/drama"" skip this one and try ""American Yakuza""."
2,The Book of Five Rings,"One of the greatest books ever written. Musashi is a genius. Even if you do not practice martial arts, you can still learn many valuable lessons from him. Trust me on this, as I am a kung fu master."
2,Love Amazon!,"I looked all over for a good trike for my son (not the cheap kind that tip over). As a last resort, I checked the internet. I thought the shipping fees would be too much. But, I found just what I wanted for less, including shipping, than the cheapies. I love the all metal frame. It is slightly shorter than I thought it would be. I should have come here first and saved myself a ton of time!"
1,let down,"I was very excited to receive this tripod but was sad to find it arrive to me package fine, with the top part broken off inside."
2,Love it!,"I bought this because my periods are very erratic flow-wise, and I was tired of always carrying multiple kinds of tampons and extra pads, never knowing what I would need throughout the day. This little miracle has solved that problem. I put it in at home, go to work or school, and I don't have to worry about leaks all day! I don't have to empty it until after I've gotten home. Before, I might be changing tampons every 3-4 hours and worrying about leaks, but not any more. I wish I had known about these sooner!"
2,Burkes Books,"I always enjoy James Lee Burke's ""Dave Robicheaux"" series. I have most of his books and will be ordering more. Thanks."
2,Addictive!,"The new Elinor Lipman book is addictive to say the least. I started it yesterday and finding hard to work today- I just want to be reading.The main character, Natalie, is different then other Lipman characters for we grow up with her.This book also deals with religious discrimination and class struggle.I love it!"
2,...a fond farewell to Barriemore Barlow,"Ostensibly, rock-music historians will write that the highest-regarded Jethro Tull line-up included Barriemore Barlow drumming. And while STORMWATCH includes many tracks of note, it is the last CD containing the unique style of BB. However for me, STORMWATCH has, as one of it's tracks, the best Tull rocker ever recorded. ""Somethings On The Move"". If you cannot rock to this tune, then you should just hang up your silver-buckle shoes right now. Buy it...you will never regret it."
1,Not a good thing,"The Tineacide in CREAM form is a great product. The spray however will leave you breathless, in a bad way. No matter how many times I have tried it, it gets me coughing and gagging."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a big David Cross fan but I'm not a blind David Cross fan which means I'm not going to advocate anything he does just because it's him. I own the Mr. Show DVD's and I have his concert CD, so when I received this DVD for Christmas I was very happy.I do want to give credit for his experimentation with something different in the form of a documentary for his concert tour. It was interesting but it just wasn't all that funny. I watched this with two other fans and we were all left feeling like this could have been so much more. It was even hard to watch at points where it came off like a bad episode of ""Insomniac"". It did have its highlights such as the cameos by Mr. Show alums and a scene with a guy who might be the worst interviewer I've ever seen.This DVD comes with a warning that it isn't a stand-up comedy special. Unless you just HAVE to watch all things Cross, I suggest you heed that warning and steer clear of this."
1,A weak effort,"I agree this book would not have been published if Wambaugh didn't already have a good track record. The plot is a variation on ""Body Heat,"" but the outcome is telegraphed so early that the only fun was seeing how the details would vary. He also seemed to be emulating ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" in early chapters, but without success. Some of the dialog made me wince."
1,I found this story very frustrating.,"The beginning was very fasinating, and introduced us to the world of nano-technologies. I started looking forward to the mystery of finding a missing woman and then became very disapointed as the story went off in other tangents that confused me greatly. Other characters were glimpsed for short stays but their place in the story was never fulfilled. The end of the story just left me glad that I did not have another page to turn. The story left me empty and not wanting more."
2,A great feel good book!,"This book is just alot of fun. Definitely the best of Bly that I have read. The plot is interesting and keeps you guessing. From the mischievous ten-year-old Paco to the mysterious, smooth talking Delnorte, Bly's characters are original and real. You can't help liking them. This book has a sweet love story that doesn't take over the book, as in most christian fictions, but is just enough for you romantics. This book also has amazing dialogue! Bly has a way of making you feel like you are sitting there right beside the character during a conversation. The heroine, Julianna, manages to weave the gospel message into her conversations without making it sound like a sermon. It was a pleasant surprise to read a christian fiction book and not get that deja veu feeling like you had read it before under a different name. In a world of christian fiction dominated by authors like Gilbert Morris this book is a breath of fresh air."
2,Why No CD?,"Like the others, I've been looking for this album which I owned years ago. It is hard to understand why there is no CD of this, or why iTunes or Amazon doen't offer it as MP3 downloads."
2,works but don't overfill,These trays are very neat & work as designed for ice. We got them for baby food & found out quickly not to overfill them or the lid is nearly impossible to get off. I like that you can pop out just the number of ice cubes you need.
1,Toiltet Paper,"I checked this book out from the library to see if it was worth buying. Thankfully that's what I did. This book isn't even worth a Fodor's backcover. Totally, Totally worthless. If you like droning verbage buy the book. If you want to learn about Sushi or how to make it move on down the road. In all the years with Amazon this is the first time I have ever given a review less than 3 stars and even that was rare until now. This book is good for carrying in your backpack into the mountains if you need emergency wipe your lower backside paper. Save your money!"
1,Good for little kids... not much else,"It's the Shadow again. If anyone is looking at this gun, I've got something to say to them: It's not worth the $20 they're asking for. The only reason that I got this gun was because I have an 8yr old little brother who needed something with a faster rate of fire than his pistol. First off, it's a CYMA. All the accessories on it SUCK and it holds maybe 50 bb's. It also shoots approximately 15-20 feet with any accuracy(and by that I mean the broad side of a barn kind of thing). And you couldn't shoot with 2 if you bought another, the mini-safety switch is in the wrong place. If you want a cheap airsoft gun, then get the HotImportToys M-4. And if you're seriouse about the sport at all, save up for a Classic Army or a REAL TM."
2,You don't have to agree with Prager...,"...to learn from him!Crack open this book, but don't forget to bring your mind along for the trip. Prager will have you revisiting values you thought you were sure of, and leave you, if a little less confident, perhaps a little more wise than you were when you began."
2,great purchase,"Got this for my children at Christmas time. It was very easy to put together and is very sturdy. I highly recommend you get the accessory pack for this easel. My sister in law loved it so much that I recently bought a second one for her son's 3rd birthday. Children love to be creative and this easel is aesthetically pleasing, sturdy, and a FABULOUS price compared to other wooden easels. I was hesitant to purchase this easel because some people said they needed to sand down the chalk board before their kids were able to write on it but I did NOT experience this. Immediately my children wrote on the chalkboard side. I recommend this easel."
2,Logitech2.4 is Aces,"The Logitech 2.4 GHz Cordless Presenter is all that I could want. I use it constantly for classroom work and in doing presentations in my consulting work. It's totally simple to use, compact and light enough to fit in a small purse, and allows me to walk around the room and not be tied to a podium. If all products worked as well and as simply, technology would be a breeze.Toby Tetenbaum, PhD"
2,Very pleased!,I buy this book every year to add to my Prayer Partner's gift bag for May. It's a wonderful book and it arrived in perfect condition.
1,It doesn't work for my 2000 Nissan Altima,"This antenna adapter doesn't work for my 2000 Nissan. After I installed it to my new car radio, I could only received very few FM stations, no AM station at all. Tried to switch back to my original nissan adapter, but it can't fit into the new radio. Luckily I don't listen to the FM/AM very often."
1,Waste of Money,We bought this phone thinking it was a great deal. It gets horrible reception even when right next to the receiver. The volume level on it is so low that I have to be in a room with no other noise in order to hear someone speak. It was a complete waste of money and now I have to spend money on another phone and throw this one out.
1,Not good,"Way too ""watery""- not a thick/dense gel. Like sitting on a roller-coaster seat. Plus it makes embarrassing noises like a ""whoopie-cushion""."
2,BEST RESOURCE BOOK !,"I have this book in 4 different places in my life. One in my office, one in my bedroom, kitchen & throne library. Each time I pick it up, I now only learn something about this skin suit I chose, but also am left with a quick and positive affirmation. Thank you LH"
1,Cloudy picture spoils an otherwise great TV!,"Let me first say that I love this TV. It has a great picture, beautiful in HD and even upscales standard definition broadcasts well. It has a nice design and plenty of inputs. However, it has a fatal flaw. If you watch television at night or in a dark room the picture gets cloudy. It is somewhat hard to put into words but essentially one part of the screen will be lighter than the rest of the picture (this especially occurs in the upper left hand corner). This is particluarly distracting when viewing darker scenes. Judging from other people's comments, this is not an isolated issue and appears to be affecting many XBR2 and 3 series television produced after August 2006 (mine was made in September 2006). A television set that costs over three thousand dollars should not have these problems."
2,Darker than Goldsmith,"This version of the Legend Soundtrack was chosen over the original Jerry Goldsmith one by Ridley Scott for release in the US. Both versions have shinning attributes to them although I am one of the minority that thinks the Tangerine Dream version is better. The feelings of eeriness and darkness coincide with the dark feelings of this movie better. If taken with the Jerry Goldsmith music, this movie feel candy coated, your atypical fairy tale... In the TG version the eeriness of the pan flutes at the beginning tune you into the fact that the fantasy movie you are about to watch is deeper and darker than those before. In the Goldsmith version I feel like I'm listening to watered down Enya, leading into Willow, or Lord of the Rings. I believe Ridley made the right decision with this music as it made it the darkness darker, and the moments of light more appreciated."
2,Happy with my purchase,"This vanity works for me. The width is good for my bedroom. I hesitated for a long time in buying the set because I had doubts. I needed something sturdy for an adult. I didn't want anything dark or too small like for kids, but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to purchase it. I'm glad I did, it's perfect. I was also concerned about the stool, but not to worry, it's also very sturdy and wide enough for a woman with big hips as a lot of us have. I'm enjoying my vanity now instead of when I was young. Now, if I'm tired, I can sit while I doll myself up. The color isn't exactly off white, it's a bit darker but still works. Assembly is easy and it's packaged with care. I really like ordering through Amazon."
1,Almost useless,"The performance of this scanner is execrable. On RARE occasions, it surprises you with a perfect scan of an entire line of text. On the other 24 scans, the quality ranges from totally garbled (not one character correct) to its ""high quality"" of text requiring a minimum of 5 corrections per line.The only possible justification for buying this pen scanner is to use with a notebook in a library where a copier or flatbed scanner isn't available. Even then, be prepared to scan each line 5 or 6 times to get a usable entry (which will still contain errors).I gave this product 1 star because that's the lowest option. It deserves a zero or lower.The two 5-star ratings above can ONLY have been given by ringers, in my opinion."
1,THU068#CP Trip Lever,"What a disappointment. I bought this through a plumber (way expensive as it turns out), and after insalling, I found that it does not lift the flapper enough to cause a proper flush, nor does the handle come back up to its full upright position after release. I have sent email to Toto to see what can be done."
1,Knocked out by how boring this was,"He was great as a side character in the 40 Year Old Virgin, he was great as a side character in Undeclared, he's not great as a leading actor, unfortunately.The 40 Year Old Virgin was ok, Carrell was obviously more than able to carry a whole movie on his own, Rogen cannot. But I didn't go into this hoping for another 40 year old virgin, I went into it hoping to laugh, and I did, maybe a whole 3 times during the 2 + hours it took for this to end.I didn't care about the characters, as the performances seemed like they were either mailed in or so over the top it would make Al Pacino blush in embarrassment. I've read here & there that there's a lot of attention paid to character in the film, as if this is supposed to be a comedic character study. Hardly, it's just another 120 minutes of Apatow's same old schtick, odd references and ""you"" this and ""you"" that.Even on it's own merit it's an instantly forgettable experience, and a waste of $4."
2,Filled the bill!,"I'm a 45 yr old tradesman and I suffer from arthritis in my thumbs (the carpio-metacarpal joints to be specific). I bought these to give me some relief by somewhat limiting my movement and by providing a little support. These fit the bill! They've been durable and wash up easily. I've worn them for up to 2 weeks between washing and they didn't stink. The terrycloth back of the thumb has pilled up a little, but that's OK. You can't beat the price either! WAY cheaper than the Mechanix Wear equivalent."
2,Bright and robust!!,"Actually, I wake up to this CD every morning. This work represents a seamless blend of Portugese classical guitar and the jazz styles of Charlie Haden. A fair amount of free improv, but also more than enough ""tempo-ed"" music to keep things focused and interesting. Paredes guitar work is extremely alive on this album; a lot of energy in each track. Not an utter masterpiece, but very different, if that is what you are looking for."
1,Used Shoes?,"I was really excited when I got these shoes but when I opened the box they looked like they had been broken-in already,had noticeable scratching and fit looser than the same sized pair I had previously tried on at a store. I'm not sure if I failed to read on the site somewhere that these shoes were previously owned or something but if it did, then I'll fix my review.I only have a couple days left to decide to return/exchange them but I don't even know what size I should order now. Should I assume the next pair will be broken-in and size down or order another of the same size...My first time ordering shoes from amazon, hooray for first time experiences :\"
2,A Great Guide,"Going to Barsetshire by Cynthia Snowden is a wonderful companion guide for readers of the Angela Thirkell Barsetshire series. The minute that I received my copy, I spent an hour or so absorbed in the various sections of the book. The guide is loaded with information on characters and places mentioned in the novels. A most useful section is the one that defines quotes, abbreviations, words, and phrases. Any American reader would find this part of the guide invaluable. A brief chronological biography or Thirkell is well done. The part that gives a short summary for each novel is a helpful aid in keeping track of the numerous characters. The section on Anthony Trollope is a nice touch. It is quite evident that Ms. Snowden has put much time and effort into her well organized book. Her guide is by my side whenever I read a Thirkell novel. A must have for any Thirkell fan."
1,"POOR, POOR, QUALITY","This was about the worst DVD I have ever gotten from Amazon.com. Has to be a copy, of a copy, of a copy etc. Grainy, blurry just awful turned it off after 10 minutes"
2,Captivating,"I borrowed this book from my English teacher on a whim, expecting to bring it back the next day. Well, it's been about a week and a half now, and the book is still sitting on my bed. Not because I haven't read it, but because I can't bear to give it up. I checked my local Barnes & Noble, no luck there, so you can imagine my excitement when I discovered Amazon had it. BUY THIS BOOK. You will connect with people you have never met in ways you could never imagine. This book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster in the way only real stories can. You will love it."
2,INXS - Switch a Hit,Great CD!!! As hard as it is to believe - JD sounds so much like Michael Hutchence it's a little scary!!! This is everything that the INXS fans have wanted to hear! Pretty Vegas is still the best. I find myself singing it everywhere I go. Thanks INXS!
1,Ugly Americanism!,The title of my review states my opinion ofthe book . I will not waste my time any further
2,A helpful basic marketing book,"I have worked in marketing for many years and bought this book when I first started working in a marketing job. It was a refresher book for me after the marketing education I received. In general, this is a good basic ""what is marketing?"" book that I would recommend to a non-marketing person who wants to learn about marketing or else to someone who's just begun working in a marketing role."
1,complete junk,"This toy is useless. It is insanely loud, you cant understand anything Elmo is saying, its very top heavy so it wont stand up like it shows in the picture. The design is absurd, there no way a child could push the handle down. It says ages 18 and up, but even if your child could understand the questions theres no way an 18 month old could use this toy. It's nice that it has a handle and its portable, but thats all its good for. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone."
1,"Missing ""Christmas Caper""","Like M. Stanton, my copy of this collection is missing the ""Christmas Caper"" short on the Madagascar disc. The packaging for the disc says it's included, but it's nowhere to be found. Amazon sent me a replacement, but it was still the incorrect version. I have no idea how to contact Dreamworks about a replacement."
2,Excellent book,"I liked The Lost Army a lot, but the 3 last books have been deceptions for me. So this one took me by surprise!Brian Hodge manages to bring in what works really well with Mike's comics: the mood and the humor. But he also brings something that's sadly missing from Hellboy's drawn stories: the sense of details. I mean when you have so many cool objects and characters and locations and monsters... it's a pity that the whole thing is gone in 2 or 3 little comic books, isn't it?At least with this book we get to dive in some of the characters' previous life and the result is that we start caring about them. And I don't get that a lot from the comic book...Then again what we DON'T have is Mike Mignola's beautiful artwork which is what made me buy the first comics back then. A cover is ok but some inside illustrations would have been better.In the end I have really enjoyed this book and will buy the next ones."
2,Great Chair,"This is the first chair that I ordered on Amazon website. It is pretty comfortable and has a great look. All the materials are well packed and soft (because of the leather). It got high back and lumbar support which makes this chair even more comfortable. Really a good chair for a great office or computer space. Be careful with small spaces where you work, it could be damaged when the chair rub against the wall."
2,great family film,"Pixar have done it again, Toy Story 3 is the best of the trilogy by a mile, Very highly recommended. I hope they make another film so that my son can enjoy it. He loves all 3 of these films, in fact the whole family did."
1,Love Johnson? Keep looking,"A good source for minute information, this book functions better as a reference book than a comprehensive take on 18th century London. Readers should be advised that the first few chapters are heavy on the development of bridges and neighborhoods and such, yet there are no accompanying maps. If you are good at picturing how one lane leads into another and so on, this will be a delight. I found it extremely frustrating.The other immediate and annoying aspect is that, as other reviewers have correctly noted, Ms. Parks is no Johnsonian. Those who unluckily appreciate the Life do not understand his conversation for what it was - ""bad manners."" I feel that she uses his name to sell a work that could otherwise stand on its own. (Or maybe as ""Horace Walpole's London."") In any case, those expecting to find the comfort and familiar parlance of the big guy are going to be sorely wanting, as I was, for the late, great Mary Hyde."
1,Suprised It was so bad,"Expected much more from this movie, C'mon it's John Travolta and Denzel Washington. Travolta just seemed to overact and you never get a feel as to what drives him in this film, no layers, no subtext, he's just a bad guy. Denzel who is usually so good, was very subdued, like he phoned this one in. And I wasn't buying James Gandolfini as the mayor. Throw in some unnecessary and unrealistic car crashes and you have a mess of a movie."
2,Tons of Heat For A Low Price,"I bought this heater to bring the temperature up in my garage in the winter when I need to work in there for the day. This heater can bring the temp up in my shop from around freezing to 60 degrees farenheit in less than 30 minutes. It is pretty much ready to heat right out of the box, all you need to do is attach it to your propane cylinder, check the connections and light it. People have commented on how much noise this style heater can make, but this 80,000 btu size isn't really that loud, especially after you get to a comfortable temperature and turn it back to the lower settings. The instructions are good, they give all the details on use and the caution measures needed for this type of heater.I would recommend this heater to others, yes."
1,Very poor Windows XP support,"The shark fin looks great on my window sill. The radio reception is just OK. The Windows XP version of the RadioShark app is horrible. The manual is full of really cool features. Read a bit more and you find these only work on the MAC. On the MAC recordings can be automatically saved to iTunes. Not on a PC. On the MAC there is a little clock that tells you where you are in the time shifted recording. On the PC there is an impossible to use slider. Want to back up five minutes? LOL. On the MAC there is ""scrubbing"" so you can here and you move through the recording. Not on the PC. The MAC has a fancy new 2.0 version of the RadioShark app. The PC has a very buggy version 1.1.7. Enough said."
1,Poor sound quality,"I enjoy listening to BB King and finally found his version of Swing Low Sweet Chariot. What a deal one of my favorite artists singing one of the all-time greats, the song that is to played at my wake. Was I ever disappointed when I played the CD. The sound quality was so poor I could not enjoy the music. Only thing that comes to mind is the sound of nails being dragged across the chock board."
2,wow,One book you will read more than once.So good and keeps your attention until the end.Truly a must read book.
1,disappointed,I was disappointed with this bracelet. The stones were too light and it wasn't great quality. You could only see the silver on the bracelet because the stones faded into the silver due to their lack of color. I returned this item.
2,Sacred Steel Instrumentals,An exellent cd of Gospel music played on Hawaiian steel guitars. These instrumental sides were mostly culled from two earlier volumes in Arhoolie's Sacred Steel series. The variety of moods is exellent and this cd perfect for worshopful and joyous moods. Exellent rollicking steel guitar playing that sounds very isnpired by Him!!! Glory to God.
1,what a shame,"My friend bought this and I went over to play it I thought it would be fun but boy, was I terribley wrong. Where do I start, ok first the missions suck because almost half the game you hide behind boxes where your standing right next to the guard and your completly visible so that makes AI horrible. Next it might a little bit more better if they gave any clue where to go. besides those problems the crontrols are the worst. Example: xbox-""Press y to hit."" Me-""Theres a sleeping guard I better hit him."" Next thing you know your jumping and you wake him up and you fail and have to start all over.Goods:nothingBads:everythingDON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!"
2,Vol 1,Great beginning for the Bruce Jones story arc. Great story. Great art. Good for all Hulk fans.
1,What happened to Hot Wheels??,"When I was a kid I had Hot Wheels, Matchbox, and track to go with them. You could buy speed sets, launchers, loops, AND strips of track. But now it seems the only way you can get track is in a set and that is it. And only a few styles of cars really work well with the motorized pusher. No chance for my kid come up with her own design. No need to be creative. The manufacturers have taken the fun out of it and told kids to watch the cars go around and around and around and around and around, but don't bother laying track out from the top of thier dresser to the bed to the floor, hit the loop, and launch across the room."
1,What a disappointment,"Like many others who have written here, I absolutely loved the previous installments of the Outlander series. To my dismay, I could not finish this one, after having devoured the others. As others haver already articulated what is wrong with this book, I add my voice in the hope that the author monitors these reviews and will give us another great Jamie and Clair story next time. (And please send Roger and Brianna back! The back and forth between modern times and the past, and the linking of characters in the present to those in the past were some of the most enjoyable parts of the other books.)"
1,"Love the movie, hate the picture quality","I'm not going to comment on the movie itself because I'm assuming if you bought the Blu-ray you are already a fan.If I had paid more than $9.99 for this disk I would be upset. The picture quality is no better than my old VHS tape. I have other movies that are just as old or older that have been transferred to Blu-ray with much better success. Buy the Blu-ray version because you like the movie itself, not because you want to see a more eye popping picture."
1,Prepare to cringe...A LOT,"I waited until I'd sat through the entire movie and resisted the urge to jump to conclusions. The more I watched, the worse it got. The acting is SO BAD. The effects were SO AWFUL. The technological concepts were incredibly cheesy. Whoever designed the costumes... Well, honestly, you can only appreciate how bad it is by watching it. If you can enjoy the unintended comedic value of a really bad movie, this is for you. However, if you're looking for something well written with good acting, keep moving. I cannot for life of me understand how the previous three reviewers were so generous. I don't know, maybe they see writing good reviews for bad shows as some form of charity.Also, prepare for an extremely awkward, uh, ""love scene"" at about an hour and twelve minutes in.I really try to avoid giving one star reviews, but I honestly can't give this anymore than that."
2,"Mesmerizing, with a little let down at the end","I was absolutely sucked in (no pun intended) by this book. The fact that it's all in narration seemed to make it so much more real to me. I couldn't wait until evenings when I could jump back into the story.The ending was a let down, but made me reach for me Slave of My Thirst book, which I actually read first, but is the ""sequel"", too see if I was missing anything.Came here looking for my next horror fix..."
1,this book fell apart,"Having read this in college for a humanities class on the American experience, I only managed to get through it because I had to. If this story is representative of Nigerian culture, I have no empathy for them. I found this story went no where, there were no real accomplishments done by the main character, his could have check in to an asylum for a year, dealt with his tribal issues, what he missed out on as a kid, came back to his tribe and really made a difference with his people. Instead, we just see some ones life that just gets worse.In retrospect, the story lived up to it's name."
2,Wonderful book for anyone running a professional hatchery,"This book is aimed more for hatcheries that are raising Trout, Salmon, Catfish and other food fishes. However, there is so much information in this book that even ornamental fish hatcheries will find an incredible amount of useful information. The chapters on Fish Nutrition are especially helpful."
1,A Waste,"Bought it, now never use it. Refills are too much of a pain and it stank up the room whenever we opened it."
1,I would not recommend Critter Ridder Animal Repellent!,"I purchased the Critter Ridder Animal Repellent Granular Shaker on Sunday. I used all two pounds in my front flower bed to keep the neighbor's cat from using my yard as a toilet. Today is Tuesday, and the neighborhood nuisance is back peeing and defecating in my yard. I definitely would not recommend this product! Maybe this company should ""have a heart"" and stop taking peoples money for a product that does not do what it claims to do! It appears that haveaheart.com is padded with positive reviews of their products. Hopefully that is not the case here... NO STARS!"
2,Great product,it's really great if you are a fan of cooking@@!@!Would recommend to my friends!!Would recommend to my mum!!!
1,Cuisinart Can Opener Defective - Don't Buy,"The handle lever is made of plastic and only lasts a month or two. Once it breaks, the can opener is useless. There is no replacement part on the Cuisinart web site. Don't buy this product. I then purchased the West Bend 77203 Electric Can Opener. Awesome. One hundred times better and also cheaper. It is a much better design."
1,Yuck,"I really, really can't stand this toilet seat. All it does is collect urine in between the 2 parts. And then when you take it off the toilet, more urine drips onto my floor. No thanks."
2,Tao Te Ching,"For those who are not interested in the historical aspect of Taoism, I feel they will still enjoy this book very much because this translation preserves the spiritual mystery of the Tao Te Ching (another aspect most translations lack), and lets the reader interpret the meaning as he/she sees fit.Anyhow, in closing, a fantastic translation, that stands above the rest. I strongly recommend this for both scholars and enthusiasts alike.With warmest regards, I amRoger L. Dougherty"
2,Love the silicone rubber.,"I've tried some many other wiper blades and refills. They all squeaked, smeared, stuttered and deteriorated. I cut it to fit a Toyota Camry(87) since I could not find replacement refills for my OEM blade holder and Toyota wanted too much for just one. It worked great: runs smoothly, very clean, quiet and water drops flow off the windshield. I bought the 24"" because other reviewers mentioned the width of the blade below 24"" was bigger than what I thought would fit. Thanks to those who commented on this.I wonder if the other silicone rubber blades out there would work as well. But I am quite happy with the PIAA refills. Question is why can't the U.S. make this: the PIAA's are made in Japan."
2,Delightful music!,"The movie adaptation of this classic story was done so well by Disney (as if that would be a surprise to those of us that love Disney)...it stands to reason that the music would be fantastic as well. The original scores are so easy to learn and sing...I play this in the car almost daily for my children and we love to sing along. The music is moving to adults, and fun for children. I am sure that some of the concepts are lost on my little ones, but I know that they will come to learn the meaningful message this movie portrays soon enough. Right now they just love Quasi and Esmerelda. Quasi is a lovable character, but certainly not much to look at, which is why I love him so much. It shows that beauty is certainly the most vivid when we view it from within. What a wonderful message to send to our children in this world today, when looks and money seem to matter so much and the virtues mean so little."
2,"Ranma, a boy, a girl, a myth","Always loved Ranma. This was the first movie I saw about this wonderful character and what I can say is that the laughter of the whole TV series is included in this anime. Buy it, and the let me know if I was not right!"
2,Walnet is MUCH darker than image -- but a great deal for the $$.,"My son is 28 months and was refusing his original high chair.He's been pretty good when we go out to eat, so we wanted to try an inexpensive restaurant style chair. This one was only about $35 and I got free 2 day shipping w/Amazon Prime. It came in 1-day...set up was very fast and easy, and it is well-made and quite sturdy.I don't like the color, but in fairness, I read the reviews and knew it would probably be pretty dark. For $35, how can you complain? And best of all, our son is sitting with us at the table again (most of the time)."
1,Dangerous and misleading,"If the author had any critical thinking skills, nay, common sense, the book would never have been written. He offers countless worthless advice that is dangerous to the gambler's bankroll. Regardless of what he says, many short term sessions DO equal a long term session. People CAN play at perfect or near-perfect skill levels, with proper strategy (not to be found in this book). There are many other, more worthy books on video poker by reputable authors. My advice? Skip this book and buy the others."
2,Great fun!,"""Dice Angel"" is a great fun read. I laughed out loud several times while reading it, and the ending brought a real smile to my face. You also get to see Las Vegas from a locals point of view, which is dead on. The only reason it's not 5 stars is that it's really not meant to be. Its meant to be 4 star fun!"
2,"Good, but...","I like this face wash and is good for removing dead skin cells gently. I recommend you to use this, it's pretty good. However; the problem for me is that I have acne so I only use this about once every other week, because it doesn't nothing to help with that problem. So, if u are doomed to acne, don't use this daily."
2,Great book for traveling!,"Quammen writes fabulous prose. The articles are humorous and fascinating, with exactly the right amount of scientific background provided for the average (non-biologist) reader. It's also a great book for taking on a trip because of its format. I highly recommend this book."
2,Wonderful!,"I bought this microSD 2 GB card for my Sansa e260 mp3 player, and it has worked well. You just have to make sure that you transfer your files in the MSC format when using the card, not the MTP format. And you cannot put playlists on the card (save the playlists for the internal memory of the mp3 player) because the card does not support the MTP (media transfer protocol) format that is needed for creating and transfering playlists. This will happen with any microSD card. So, in short, use MTP format for the internal memory of the player, and MSC for the card and you will be good to go.Also, I have not noticed a longer delay in the start up (which was someone else's complaint). The start up time seems about the same. Overall, I am very satisfied with this microSD card, and the price was excellent as well."
2,Evil John Ferguson,"I saw this movie when I was 13 and it holds a special spot in my mind. It is silly and not to be taken seriously. There are tons of stars including John Astin, Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle, Pat Morita, and my fav Dick Shawn as Bing Bell. If you get this, make sure that you watch it with some friends, a few beers and make it a light hearted evening."
1,"If you're not a Dr. Laura fan, don't buy this tape.","I thought I could overlook Dr. Laura's irritating voice and condescending manner in order to get through this tape, but alas, I was wrong. She makes a few good points, but they get lost in her sarcastic and demeaning delivery. The title should be a clue that she thinks men are ""pets"" and if you go to the right obedience class (hers), you'll be fine. Her one-size-fits-all advice works only if you're married to a dog or cat. She brags in the beginning about solicitating ""donations"" from listeners to produce this tape, and how they begged her to make it. Let's hope they're the only ones who wasted money on it."
2,Amazing!,Ruben is incredible on this single. I have actually had this CD on repeat and have listened to it at least 100 times! Ruben has such a pleasing voice to listen to that I think I will listen to it everyday. He really warms my heart. Way to go Ruben!
1,Not Worth It!!!,"The zipper broke the first time we put this together. We managed to fix it, but we'll have to be careful everytime we take out the littler box for cleaning. The old littermaid cover we had was made much better."
2,"Uncertainty, loss and vital energy","Pinetop, New Mexico, slopes toward the future, and Birdy Stone, high school English teacher, slips on its desperate incline. At the novel's beginning, Birdy engages to tutor the mother of a student, Mark. The mother is inventing an account of how Mark's father and sister died. Birdy sets about to uncover the truth about those deaths. Meanwhile, she seduces Mark, who eagerly falls into lust, and tries sometimes to get a footing in her life. A existential current flows under the twine of stories. Humor gusts through the prose. Luziana, a pregnant student who knows what she wants, and Mr. John, a retarded janitor who appears to have the keys to every puzzle, and Jesus Morales, fellow teacher who travels to Albuquerque for his gay freedom, crowd into Birdy's mobile home or she into their lives. At the end, a reader is not sure where he or she has gone but, like a passenger on a amusement park ride, has enjoyed the sensation of arriving there."
1,Not a very good book.,"I am an historian and a professor of history and I just finished reading this book, and I must say that as usual, Mr. Lewis presents a very simplistic and pro-islamic view of the world. Bernard Lewis is a hack for Turkey, has he ever written one critical thing about Turkey or Islam? How can anyone take him seriously as a historian when he has repeatedly attepmted to excuse the horrendous war crimes of the Young Turks and the early Kemalists regarding the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1922. Imagine a historian claiming that American slavery never existed or that the Jewish Holocoaust never occurred, he/she would be ridiculed not given a seat at Princeton. For a much more balanced view of what Islam is capable of may I reccomend The Burning Tigris by Peter Balakian."
1,Not very useful...,"The ShapeXpress cutting tool is easy to use, and very easy to change the blade, but don't cut well... I don't know if this is 'cause I'm left handed, but the blade turns everytime, can't complete any shape without spoil at the end... If you want good shapes, I better recomend a paper trimmer/guillotine, and a corner paper punch, or shape paper punches.The cutting mat that came in the set is very good."
1,Humor is out of place for a Christian book,"Book was recommended by a friend but I didn't get past the chapter called ""Church"" because I just don't think that we should have to be joking about things like like this. Why would the writer describe for instance a doctor who told people that they had a week to live so that he could witness to them about eternal life? This is not funny. This is tragic! We are to be sober and vigilant, not funny and entertaining. There is nothing humorous about church or the gospel message. We need to cut out this sort of thing."
1,I expected a better product,"I liked these paddles right out of the package. Looked and felt like a pretty good deal. Got them at Christmas time and they have been used a handful of times. We're not thru February yet and the rubbers are peeling off the paddles. I wasn't expecting great quality, but peeling after a few weeks is not acceptable. In the set of four paddles we have only used two of them and they are both peeling. It's not a good value if it is trash this quickly. I guess paying more for better quality might end up being cheaper in this case."
2,The best way to learn!,This DVD is very helpful in learning how to hold and play the violin. It was more thorough than the instructor on the first of my only two lessons in a shop. It has three songs from book 1 and other songs from the other four books. It's very very helpful in showing you the different techniques and understanding what the terms mean in playing. I am almost done with book one and looking forward to book 2. The DVD as well as the CD are an important part of learning for the self taught. I have very little natural music ability if any and this book and DVD are the key for me learning violin.
1,Does not conform to any actual practice. Harmful.,"If your goal is to prepare effectively and efficiently for legal practice, do not use this book. Not a soul actually uses the CREAC formula advocated here, and all you end up doing is unlearning terrible habits you were made to acquire during your first year. Use Aldisert or Neumann instead. The techniques taught in those books conform to real practice, and you will look much more competent and professional if you use them than if you do anything this book advises you to do. If you are not a captive audience, avoid this book at all costs. If you are made to use it in your first year skills course, take CREAC with a grain of salt and be prepared to fix the damage during your first summer job. The technique advocated by this book is simplistic, plodding, and simply does not begin to meet even minimal standards of professional legal writing."
1,Too Small,I is just to small to make good use of the machine. You can barely get a shot glass under the basket for the espresso.. get something else.
1,No memory,"Product title is misleading. This should not be called a memory foam topper. It is just foam. If you push down on it with your hand, it doesn't leave any imprint. Not even for a split second. I wish I had spent more for real memory foam."
2,Excellent food for all dogs,"I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie-Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem--her ears weren't infected--but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of bread (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong."
1,Uncomfortable to wear,The major problem that I had with the headset is that it is so lightweight that when I walk it moves loosely on my ear.
1,You Gotta Be Kidding Me,"People who gave this clunker five stars really need to get out more. The acting, even for the ""stellar"" cast was cardboardy, and the script was...well, there wasn't a script. It was another brainless rehash of Hal Lindsay eschatology. It is embarassing, to tell the truth. Don't waste your time with this movie. Go play with your kids, or take the dog for a walk, or something. Anything."
2,BOOKS,"I read the one published in '71, I think it was a very interesting book to read. Its a story about exploring drugs and sexuality (straight/gay). I would recomend this book to an open mind"
1,Movie good. Ultraviolet bad.,"I was going to buy the blu ray/rental combo for $22, but then I saw that it came with the ultraviolet ""digital copy"" and decided to rent the movie for $3.99 instead.When this movie is (if?) sold without ultraviolet, then I'll buy it. Ultraviolet is so grossly inept as a digital copy that it shouldn't even be called that. Having to create two accounts with two separate entities just to watch a movie (on approved devices only) I already have the disc for is asinine. What was wrong with the original digital copy that didn't require additional registering and I could transfer straight to Itunes/WMP? Bring the old digital copy back please.BTW, the movie was great. Get rid of ultraviolet."
2,Orwell himself was a Democratic Socialist,"From Wikipedia(in regards to Stalin's Russia) and Animal Farm. The novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also how wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed and myopia destroy any possibility of a Utopia. While this novel portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution (and NOT the act of revolution itself), it also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if smooth transition to a people's government isn't satisfied."
2,Turrentine bring us Irene Cara in her best moment,"As a Irene Cara fan since a couple of years ago I decided to order it. Ok, I'm not disappointed. Let's talk about an AWESOME album... There you'll find a precious stuff from early 80's and songs whose rhythm will remember you very much of songs from the original FAME movie soundtrack. It's jazz and listening it you'll be sure that Stanley Turrentine was a genius. ""You Can't Take My Love"" (performed by Irene Cara) and ""I Knew It Couldn't Happen"" (performed by Derald Conway) are the best songs and sound us like a classics taken from synthesizer era. The others are instrumental songs arranjed by sax but so much enjoyable as ""I'll Be There"", for example, which bring us an unforgettable team of backing vocals. If you like synth, 80's songs and related things I'm quite sure you'll love it!!!"
1,Absolutely no baon flavor in it,"I bought this bone for my two beagles. But they don't chew this bone often. If this bone has bacon flavor, I bet they will not only chew it everyday, they will finish the bone in several weeks. This bone has only bacon color. This is just an ordinary plastic bone."
1,What a Stinker !,"This movie sucks , Star studded cast but crappy rediculous story ! I could have went too sleep and wrote a better script myself !!!!!!!! Save your money !!!!!!!!!!"
2,All you need for MCAT,"The book offers a comprehensive review of the subjects, everything is concise and to the point. Offers excellent exercises which are very close to the actual test. Good luck on MCAT."
1,Get a different phone,"I've decided to get a different phone. My biggest complaint is that this phone spontaneously turns off (even when it's locked). When it is on, the ring tones are hard to hear. The default ""Select"" button is in the middle of the arrow buttons, and it takes me 3 or 4 tries to push it sucessfully."
2,My favorite move of all time,"I love John Hughes and I love the brat pack, and I have to say this movie is WAY better than all of the others. And it's not just those who graduated in the 80s who haven't seen this movie who're locked in a cave, but ANYONE who has not seen Club is culturally deprived and should seek help imediately."
1,so-so,"I found this book rather irritating to read. The plot is good, but my problem is that every hundred pages or so a new section begins and introduces an entirely new cast of characters which makes me feel like I'm reading a completely different book and also makes it difficult to stay interested. I am really annoyed by this, so that's why I give it 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,JP in Calif,"Less than 2 years old now, very light use. (office only) Blows water out around porta filter. Found the only authorized shop to repair these machines are on the east coast. With shipping and repairs cost over $200.00. They said the gaskets were worn out and the boiler support needed replacing. I have a Gaggia at home and have never had any problems."
1,Ugh,"If you want to see this movie RENT IT FIRST! It was stupid, predictable, and all around a waste of time. Don't get me wrong I like Inuyasha, but this...this was too much! I don't want to give too much away. For one thing the animation was different. Everyones eyes like doubled in size, and their hair looked like wet/crimped. I mean seriously! I wish I could tell you more without giving the whole movie away. But I won't say anything else except-please take my word for it! This movie is a wet blanket! I was disappointed, shocked, and appauled. RENT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
1,Big waste of dinero!,"So you're looking for a dummy to use? Well let me tell you, don't get this one. It's a total rip off, you can't even move the arms.. you can only move the mouth which hardly moves at all. This is not worth the money, you're better off getting plush puppets."
2,The new hot book,"I was in Chapter 11, the bookstore chain not the legal state, when a salesperson said that this would soon be the new hot book. Her book club was reading it and she said she was only 120 pages into it, but that I should buy it. I had been well steered by her in the past. What a find. This is a thriller more than a historical novel. I read it in one weekend. That is rare for me.Damn fun reading."
1,An inferior Fonda Western.,"This sequel to 1939's far superior ""Jesse James"" misses much of the humor and stark imagery that made the first film such a (underrated)masterpiece. Fonda is good as Frank but the script gives him little to do and Lang's direction is likewise handsome but undistinguished. A minor addition in both the Lang canon and the Fonda Western canon."
1,Ouch that hurts,I don't even own any of nightwish's CD's but i am glad i could review it and thankfully never have to say i actually own any of thier cd's. They may be good and all that i will never know just not my style.I recommended kidney thieves to a forum and Nightwish was a recommendation in return
1,"No plot, just grunts","I like action movies, but this was totally stupid, the girl who was tortured by Eric Roberts then tells her dad to stop before he kills Eric is just one small act of stupidity. Enough said. Don't waste your money, I'm glad I only paid 12.99 for it and that was 12.00 too much."
2,Everyday Creative: 30 Ways to Wake Up Your Inner Artist,I really liked the cards. I teach a class in creativity and I was able to give them to individual students to encourage their creative growth.
1,Not the best,I got this bag as a shower gift and wish I would have returned it. If you have too much in the bag you can't get the changing pad in and out very well and the top never stays closed.For the money....look for something else.
1,Disappointed...,"I've been ordering Huggies Step 4 (Economy Pack) from Amazon since arriving in US. During a recent offer, I ordered 3 boxes. The quality of diapers is the worst I've ever used. So far, 2 diapers had been defective - the snap on came off when I put on the diaper on my child. Also, the material is different from what you would get if you buy those smaller size pack from grocery stores."
2,Yummy,"Wonderfully sensual and intimate. It brought out the kitty in me :-). This alblum has a nice and funky flavor; to start it's R&B + soul with a Joi twist. If sex, or intimacy scares you, stay away. She's a woman really in touch. Great for a night with your partner or for a night in which you are trying to meet a ""partner"""
1,Sounds terrible,"These were available for $8 shipped, so I figured, what do I have to lose? Answer: $8. They make the volume much louder, as advertised. Problem is, they completely degrade the tone - it sounds like you are listening to the earphones through a tube (which I guess you essentially are).I gave them 2 stars because judging from the reviews, I figured there are many people who will not be able to tell the difference in the sound. I tossed them - recommend to pass on this one."
1,Deathtrap is horrible!,"From the company that brought you classic games as Tomb Raider and Fear Effect, Eidos Interactive brings to you: Deathtrap Dungeon. A game that they shouldn't have even put their name on. This game sucks from start to.... well I never even got past the first level because this game is that horrable. Graphics - I've seen better looking dungeons for the 8 BIT Nintendo then in this game. The graphics are so grainy, my eyes started to hurt after only 10 mins of playing. The camera angles are very slow and choppy. I don't see how anyone would think this game looks good.Sound - There is no background music (at least not in the first level) and the sound effects in general or just plain bad. The control is by far the worst part of Deathtrap Dungeon, but I won't get into it, because I'm only aloud a maximum of 1000 words... LOL. Bottom line is - this game isn't even worth the $2.50 to rent."
1,WHY NOT THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK!!??,"Yes, It's just remakes to the great songs from the original Teen Witch film. Only problem is... the singers are terrible!!! The way they sang on the original film soundtrack(never released)blows this release out of the water. This sorry excuse for a soundtrack sounds like local high school kids singing over the original tracks on a karoeke machine. It's like Paris Hilton remaking the Bodyguard soundtrack, why would you? Do the fans a favor and release the original!!! Or find better vocalists!!"
2,"Better than nothing, but here's hoping for more.","This is my wife's and my favorite series. So funny. So real.Of course, we wish Sony would get beck to releasing full seasons...with commentaries and extras.This collection has some gems, but excludes some of the funniest and most touching episodes, particularly from season 3 (""Purseona"", ""Cake Fear"", ""My Boyfriend's Back"", ""Up In Smoke"", etc.). Also missing is Mel Brooks' first and funniest appearance as Uncle Phil, in the ep. ""The Grant"".Regardless, I'm looking forward to the release date, when I will hold my wife's hand, laugh, cry, and be grateful that a television show could reveal life with such compassion, honesty, and true wit.Again, here's hoping Sony, Riser, Hunt and Jacobson collaborate to release the rest of the series, with lots of extras."
2,Provides good examples of successful mail order campaigns.,"A good historical review of successful mail order campaigns. Contains a lot of print advertising examples with some background information about the sales it generated and the company behind it. Does not really spend a lot of time showing you ""How to""."
1,All bull****,All those claims of improved reception are a joke. I plunked down over 20 dollars for a splitter that worked exactly like my 2.99 splitter. I guess I should have just taken it off and returned it but you all know what a pain that is. I'll have to chalk it up to experience.Bottom line: Don't believe everything you read. It's probably all just one scheme and sale pitch.
2,The Best!,"L. M. Montgomery is the BEST author! I've read all of her books. The imagery in her stories is beautiful- no one can describe places and events the same way. The series is full of humor, sweetness, sorrow, and originality."
1,Poor print quality,"I was disappointed and distracted by the print quality of this edition of The Message, which I purchased as a gift. There is significant bleed-through, making the text difficult to read. I checked hard copies of other editions at a bookstore, then returned this edition to Amazon and ordered another edition with better readability."
1,Fake Price,2 days ago this item was listed for $50. I ordered it and the order was confirmed. This morning I got an email saying the order was cancelled. I returned to this web site to see the item had been marked up to $129. Beware - not sure this site is legitimate.
1,If you like reggae with drum machines,"If you like reggae with drum machines, you probably still won't like this. I don't know what drum machine they are using but it sounds like an 80's casio keyboard through some whacky (not in a good way) effects. The sad thing is this album could have been pretty good if the OG skinhead laurel aitken had only hired a few extra musicians, our at least pulled together a decent sampler."
1,"Works, but quality isn't great","The headset works as advertised. I've paired it with my MacBook Pro as both a headset and headphones. When listening to iTunes music, however, there's a persistent hiss in the background. Additionally, the controls are in an awkward location and require you to push too hard to activate the buttons. I shouldn't have to crush my ear to play/pause the music.It's also annoying that the power adapter isn't a more standard plug type. A mini-USB plug would be great since that would allow the headphones to be charged by plugging them into a USB port. That's handy when you're overseas and have a limited set of international power adaptors."
1,BS,"I have used the product for a year. I thought it great. Company policies now make me a more than dissatisfied customer.I tried to update my PS Gold 5.0.2xx to 5.0.3xx. The update site was confusing and suggested that I download to determine if I was elegible (you have to be kidding). I nonetheless did so. It updated my copy with a trial version. The company now asks for a $44 fee for the ""upgrade"" as I am out of date for updates. This is the same version (5.x)!!! I will not be upgrading to v. 6 either. I refuse to do business with any company that chooses to charge me for fixing bugs and providing insignificant improvements."
1,Doesn't Work Straight from the Box.,"Right out of the box, this item would not work and it is an item that is not allowed for return. Thankfully, customer service was able to help with this by giving me a refund. I will NOT be buying this item again. I will find something else to replace it with."
2,Casio Battery EX-75,This battery is better than the OEM battery I had and price was right. I purchased 2.
2,Great movie,I love this movie. When I got it it was in great shape! And worked just fine.I only give it four stars because it took forever to get in the mail.
2,Christmas Classic,"A friend of mine told me about the book so I quickly ordered one for myself. It is just as the back cover says, destined to become a new Christmas classic. As I read, I found myself consumed with not only the story, but the characters. The ending was a bit of a surprise which is not usual for me. The giving spirit of Christmas finds new hope in this book, just as Hope (the main character) finds the kind of treasure that can't be put in a jar."
2,Alice-in-Wonderland,"Every time I enter my kitchen and look at my stovetop, I feel like I'm about to have tea with the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter! This kettle was an impulse buy at Target and I don't regret it a bit. My old, rather undersized kettle was a piece of junk; it didn't even whistle anymore (which was kind of dangerous, actually.) This product is a keeper--it's cheerful whimsical, it holds a great deal of water, and it works! Boiling water greets you with a whistle and a madly spinning corkscrew. The only drawback is that it is rather heavy to lift when filled to capacity, so it's not for anyone who's really tiny, or has a weak grasp. The price was also extremely reasonable for such an artsy, functional, and substantial piece. It would make a GREAT wedding gift, or a just-because gift. I'm buying another one to send to my cousin, whose kettle is also due for the junk heap. Thanks for this fun and useful item."
2,AS1300,"The best small air compressor that I have ever seen or used,you can just set the pressure and forget it. amazing,I really like it,can't go wrongThanks Ernie"
1,Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable,"I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth. There is no connection between the middle-English and its translation.That was a wasted 5.99 USD for kindle version and a HUGE disappointment :( ..."
2,Action packed,This movie doesn't disappoint. My kids and I both liked it. My kids had never seen any of the previous ones and didn't need to in order to follow along.
2,Great griddle,Perfect for those mornings when the entire family is here. Can put out eggs & pancakes so quickly. love it!
2,Adore grows in time,"When I first bought this album I didn't much care for it,I just went back listening to Siamese Dream or Mellon Collie..., But without warning the album kind of crept up on me,I found myself listening to every song and loving every minute of it. Certain people will hate this CD, but if your a fan of their b-side stuff and compilation songs you'll have no problem with it.Overall Adore is a masterpiece, and if you give it the time it deserves you'll love it as much as I do."
2,A must for beginners in Isian Magick,"The Mysteries of Isis is one of the best books published on Isian Magick. detraci Regula explains it all in an easy to understand manner which is beneficial to beginners and advanced students alike. She tells you how to make various instruments detremental to the workings of Isian Magick, important dates, and some basic spells. She also includes information on where to find items you may need. Regula will bring you to temples of ancient times and make you feel as though you were really there.As a practioner of Isian Magick, I reccommend this book to everyone interested in Isis and her magick... wether you want to become a practioner or just learn about it."
2,Everybody deserves to be loved.,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Christines discovery of her love for the phantom along with his discovery that he could be loved. The way they both worked through their innocence to move to a deeper level of love and commitment was fun to experience. My only real criticism would be Christines complete obsession of their child from birth to the exclusion of the phantom. I do not believe that she would not be able to balance them better than she did. It would have been great for the phantom to have left a legacy in the form of his son who was so promising. But even so he was able to enjoy being loved as a man and to be a part of the world that had always shunnned him even if he did have to do so still somewhat from the shadows. It was a fun read if you are a phantom lover!
2,WORKS BUT FIT IS A LITTLE OFF,"For a ""drop-able"" camera, this helps keep it from getting scratched in the dropping process! It works, but the fit is a little off, and you have to get used to which button does what before you start using it, since it obscures the buttons and makes them slightly more difficult to use. The manufacturer should have made cut-outs where the buttons are, and made the fit closer."
2,waogawognarogn,its nice melodic metal...the lyrics are a little whiny...old killswitch engage was definitely harder but this is a nice cd to listen to when you need a break from all that thrash metal and hardcore...
1,Stay away from these! Poor design!,"Hanes has definitely changed their 'fit' profile. These boxer briefs are made in a way that they fit so awkward that I refuse to wear them anymore. I'm going to look for a new brand.As others have stated, the crotch hangs way down, offering no support, unless you pull them up to your belly button. In addition, the legs are too tight around the thighs.Steer clear of these! You will be disappointed."
1,Glitz & Flash w/o substance,"I've been a fan of Santana since the first album but Lotus bears little resemblance to what I expected. I read the reviews and bought it based on that about 4/5 years ago. I found most of this album to be annoying--some excellent playing but it goes nowhere. The screeching guitar is just too much to take--almost like fingernails on a chalkboard. I can not imagine sitting down to listen to this again--When I bought it I felt that way but attributed it to maybe I just wasn't in the mood to listen. So I put it away for a month and came back to it twice and feel the same way and my receptivity does not appear to be changing. The last listen was today and it's been a year since I've listened to it last. I'm sorry--it's not happening for me. He's still a great guitarist, but to me---this is noise!"
1,Do not buy this game!,Do not buy this game! The game will shutdown your PSP at random times during game play. The kicking will not showup 50% of the time during kickoffs and fieldgoals. The game also will freeze right as you cross the goalline on touchdowns and turnovers. This game should have never been released with all these bugs.
1,Shortchanged,The one song I wanted to hear was in the movie. It was a song by Teddy Pendergrass and it was cut out for some reason. The rest of the music was somehow connected to a rap group who did not perform many songs in the movie.It was a waste of cash.
2,Such a fun read!,Both my daughter and I enjoyed the round-the-world trip this book took us on. The artwork is beautiful as well.
2,Great Pirate Read!,I love Pirate and sea going historicals. But even I know they all pretty much run along the same theme. So I was pleasantly surprise to read Cheryl Howe's The Pirate and The Puritan! The title jumps out of you and it doesn't stop there. The book itself is one of those you do not wish to put down till it is done. Felicity and Drew take us on one great voyage. Both characters are strong and endearing at the same time. This author is some one to watch!
1,can we say...Pink Floyd?,"I got this CD with a collection for x-mas when it came out from waveform.I tried to like it, but tried to get rid of it several times and held on to it. Well I took it out again just now and listened to it one more time. These guys are trying to be pink floyd. Since we already have a pink floyd why should we have an imitator?could do without the vocals. This one will be in the next stack to go to the resale shop. Save your money and buy Thievery corp or something else."
2,A great puzzle game,"This game is great! Each level is basically a puzzle -- you have to figure out how to modify the track to sort out marbles that you drop into the top. The levels start pretty simple but gradually work up to higher and higher levels of complexity. It sounds simple, but the higher levels are just mind-boggling!Kids and adults can all enjoy this, although kids may not get all the way through the levels. I'm not a child psychologist, but I'm sure this game will help your kids develop their problem-solving skills.I had this game years ago, but have lost my source disk, so was looking to replace it. Unfortunately, I don't know whether this will run on newer operating systems."
2,Wonderful! Reveiw by a 12 year old,"This is a wonderful book! It tells the story of a young girl who is a preachers daughter and faces always moving from place to place, therefore never having any friends. When Jo moves to Jericho, she finds a new friendship in an unexpected person. She must face the racism in her town and help her friend overcome it and other challenges. This is a wonderful book, for all ages!"
1,Obnoxious,"William Gass is so obviously an obnoxious creep that I suggest avoiding him at all cost. This ridiculous, boring, tedious thing he calls a novel should never have been published. It's no wonder the publishing industry is having problems when the produce terrible books like this. Someone please take this man's typewriter away from him."
2,Artfully crafted lessons and brief but challenging exercises,"Guitar Shop: A Beginner's Guide To Learning Lead And Rhythm Guitar is designed specifically for the novice who wants to quickly become adept at playing the lead and rhythm guitar. Bill Watson draws upon his many years of experience and expertise as a successful guitar teacher and player to present a truly effective and ""user friendly"" do-it-yourself instruction manual. With its system of checks to track progress, artfully crafted lessons, and brief but challenging exercises, Guitar Shop covers all the basic scales and chords, can be used alone or with free online tools, and makes a splendid addition to school music class reference collections. If you want to learn to play the guitar, begin with Bill Watson's Guitar Shop."
2,England's best kept secret!,The latest Bluetones album is amazing....more so than their freshman Expecting to Fly. Last Chance Saloon's songs are better crafted and superbly performed. The Morris brothers have again shown up Brit's babes by producing a well-rounded and well-written extravaganza for the ears and mind.
1,Cornwell should stick to Kay Scarpeta!,Patricia Cornwell should stick to forensic science! This book is slow and seems disjointed. the characters have all the appeal of watching grass grow. i won't buy another unless it's about Scarpeta. why mess with a good thing. anyone i talk to can't stand it. her books are usually a treat to read; they shouldn't be a chore!
2,Outstanding Guide to Word-of-Mouth,"I've read numerous marketing books over the past five years. The Sercrets of Word-of-Mouth reallys stands out. It addresses perhaps the most powerful yet most overlooked (and least tapped) area of marketing. Few books or marketing courses outline or discuss word-of-mouth marketing as clearly as George Silverman does in his book. His easy to read book offers numerous recommendations on using word-of-mouth. While I already do some of the things recommended by Silverman, I gained valuable ideas on how to improve what I am currently doing and learned other strategies. I highly recommend this book."
1,Boring,"I thought the whole movie was boring and annoying. Other 9/11 movies like United 93 and Twin Towers are much more inspirational. Now you enjoy watching an aggravated depressed child for 90 minutes this is just the movie for you, not for me."
1,Lousy product,"You almost never get a clean signal and unless you have a full time assistant constantly changing radio stations for you and reading the almost unreadable digital display, it's dangerous to use this product and drive. Don't buy it."
1,Disappointed,"This is the second time I have tried a re-manufactured product. This is a different brand that I have tried and am still disapointed. This product is not packaged in the green-boxed ""Focus"" brand packaging as shown. The print is poor quality, very light, and not crisp. I need to set my printer properties on ""best quality"" to get fair results. I relied on the previous reviews, however in my experience it seems you still have to pay top dollar for an OEM product to GUARANTEE good results."
2,Excellent CD - one of my favorite Nakai CDs,A little while back I had the fortune of listening to the Carlos Nakai Quartet when they played outside under some trees at a native american art sale being held at the U of A. I was already a fan of Nakai's solo pieces... After they played a selection from this album (Crow Canyon) I knew I'd have to jump up and buy a copy of Big Medicine. I was not disappointed. Lots of great music on this Album - several favorites. I'm not sure if the short clips available for online play really show how good the music is on this album.
1,less funny than obnoxious,"This author reminds me of the kid we all knew in high school who got a big laugh at one of her jokes and from that point on, it was ""all stand up, all the time"". I think the punch of her wit is watered down substantially by the fact that we see it in virtually every single line. We get it! You're funny! Now, will you please get on with the story?? I'm only halfway through but I honestly, i have no desire to continue. Enough already."
2,BACK FOR REVIEW NUMBER TWO.....,Well fellow surfers I have follow this group on both albums and the U.S. version has three new songs which are very good. Let me tell you when I marry in the future I will plan on using steps to tell her how I really feel about her. Just like Abba told us in the 80's..
1,"Trouble, Trouble","Immediately after purchasing the player I had to return it because it hesitated badly on almost all DVDs. The player was gone for two weeks, but worked fine when it was returned. Player worked for the next 12 months of (infrequent) use, then just quit working. It is not worth paying for repairs, so it is being junked and I am buying another brand to replace it."
1,"Protects the blade well, but leaves marks on the knife.",The BladeSafe keeps theVictorinox 47520 Fibrox 8-Inch Chef's Knifein place perfectly. The problem is that the same black plastic bits that hold the knife in place leave permanent oval marks on the sides of the knife.
1,If you like Tori Amos..,"... but you see I can't stand Tori Amos. Spektor has the same shortcomings. Where there is a clear gift for catchy melodies and interesting piano lines, the words amount to bad poetry, and the vocal is unbearably quirky and affected. You won't find a real person trying to communicate a genuine feeling here, whether the feeling you seek is horniness, violent rage, just-gotta-get-up-and-dance, or abject depression. Sung here are songs of an amateur discovering that words can sound cool unscrutinized, and if you act like an elf, you can enchant the foolish."
1,"Only ONE connector ships, and does not include the cable crimps","I haven't yet had the opportunity to use this product, but the order only includes ONE connector, and does not include the 2 crimps that it says it comes with. I've returned one order to Amazon (great customer service for an essentially robotic process with no human contact) and the second was the same: single connector, no crimps. Beware!"
1,I'd give it a zero if I could.,"This book (and entire series) is a trashy redux of Tolkien that deserves the worst punishment available.All of the characters are flat and dull, the good guys are ENTIRELY good (like angelic,) and all of the bad guys are ENTIRELY bad (like hugely demonic.)There is no real experimentation in any sense throughout this book our the series, believe me, I read it twice. There's the beat up, wheezing idea of the swordsmaster. How original.I suggest something better, like the Dark Tower series by Steven King or China Mieville's Bas-Lag books.Don't read this trash, for the love of god."
1,to be read with caution,"As it happens sometimes the author hates its subject. This is the case. Green doesn't miss any chance to discredit the period he's writing about.Almost half of the chapters are devoted to philosophy, literature, art. And this is would be too much for me already. Yet, every poet or philosopher is scientifically demolished (this is the only scientific thing in this book), ofter with very personal and badly argued opinions and views.Maybe hellenistic times represented a decline as far as literature and philosophy are conserned. But what about Euclid, Archimedes, Herophilos, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes namely the founders of modern geometry, mathematics, statics, idrodynamics, anatomy, astronomy? The hellenistic age gave birth to modern science. Yet, only thirty pages (of almost eight hundreds!) are devoted to those striking accomplishments, and only to diminish them."
2,A Very Underated Western.,"William Holden and McDonald Carey are two gunslingers who save lady in distress Mona Freeman.Soon Bill and McDonald go their different ways,William is the good guy while MR Carey remains an outlaw.Mona,of course,is the object of the boys affection.Soon,Williams pal William Bendix is killed by McDonald setting William against McDonald.Needless to say,it comes to a showdown.After seeing this you will say,They dont make westerns like this anymore.Good Cast,Stanley Ridges,Alfonso Bedoya(Again,as in Treasure OF Sierra Madre,an evil villian)etcDir by Leslie Fenton"
2,Great show.... in person and on DVD :),"I went to this show back in February with a friend, but was not initially going to go. I enjoyed it immensely, and the fact it was being filmed was great also! I had never been to a filmed concert before. One thing that you may not know, is that at the actual show, things were kinda messed up. The whole opening sequence went wrong when the dancers came down on the elevated platforms. When they got to the bottom, Janet et al. just walked off stage! We then had to wait a bit, and a guy came out and explained they were going to do it again! It was rather funny, but I'm sure Janet was mad! So what you see on the dvd, was actually a spliced version of two different opening sequences since the pyrotechnics did not occur the second time around. Anyway, the concert was ace, and I would recommend this DVD to anyone into Janet or the current state of Pop/R&B music today."
1,"""Arseje"" is CRAP","This song is the worst piece of crap I've heard on the radio... EVER!!!. It's nothing but a group of ugly talentless spanish chicks who don't know english trying to sing ""Rapper's Delight"" over surf music. I'm not surprised that most of the people who bought this coaster also bought TATU's last album. atleast that's a good sign that this crappy song won't be poluting the airwaves for very long and will die out soon just like that damn TATU song. Everyone who bought this album is SICK, SICK I SAY, SIIIICK!!!!!!, I hope you all die soon. And if I could rate this CD as 0 stars i would, but the damn rating system only goes as low as 1, so that will have to do."
2,waiting for blue ray,"So far this was the best gundam out, the story tackles the same issue about war and peace but in a less childish way and very advanced motionJust need it on BLUE RAY so i could buy the whole series"
2,Quick read- which is good because you'll have to repeat it often.,"My 16 month old fell hard for this simple counting book. Though my husband and I are so sick of reading this one, we have to oblige several times a day. Baby has had it over a month and still chooses it over & over again. This book doesn't look like much but it clearly resonates with toddlers. The pictures are simple and graphic and emphasize spotting the dots. I know it will grow with him as Baby becomes ready to count. I wish we had purchased a board book version because the page with the snowman's face is getting mushy from all the kisses it receives."
2,Super Sticky Once or Twice,"Super Sticky PostItNotes are super sticky, but they do not seem to be super sticky more than once.I use PostItNotes for outlining and project management, and I need to place, remove, place, and remove my PostItNotes over and over. I just don't feel that these will work as well as my regular PostItNotes.-----BUT-----They will stick and do stick to the un-ordinary better than the regulars!!!"
1,I Need My Ass Kicked For Watching This Gah-bage,And NO Im not a super postive person who thinks somethings wrong with people for liking this movie because all of the violence and swearing. This movie started out pretty good & felt like the 1st Spider-Man movie but in reverse. It felt like one of those movies were you know its going to be a good movie BUT that ain't the case with this. After awhile this movie just got real boring and pointless. And I almost ALMOST!!! checked my watch as many times as I did when watching Avatar
2,Reusable Thermometers,"This is an awesome item. So far I have only used it while barbequeing. I have not used all of the probes tho. The only down fall with these probes is the one for the steaks. It would be very helpful to have a color chart for doneness and packaged with that probe. Fortunatley for me I had bought 2 packages, so after tearing up and tossing the packageing I was able to refer to the 2nd one which was a gift. Other than that, they are great."
2,It was ok,"It was ok, though was kind of confusing keeping track of the timeline, and it was made before the end of the second season since they didn't really mention, even though it was done in the second part with the dna digivolving. It was a good story though, and does beat out that other show."
2,Need more movies like this,"Good writing, acting and music. This was a funny and powerful movie that they seem to have trouble making in the US anymore?"
1,Unintentionally hilarious,"There's much that is amusing -- all unintentionally -- about this movie. The acting is particularly wooden, but given the dialogue that Ayn Rand wrote, it's difficult to see what options the performers had.I have to say that the strangest scene revolves around Howard Roark's trial. After all, his destruction of the buildings can only be described as an act of terrorism, and his defense of his actions reminds me how the Weather Underground described their use of violence in the 1970's. And yet many in the Republican party have come to deify Ayn Rand and her ideas. I never would have believed I would have lived long enough to see such a strange transformation. All hail the revolution!"
2,Works OK!,If your a heavy drinker you might have to take four pills for one night. Other than that they work ok. Its not perfect for me depending on how much i drink but it eases the nausea and lessens my headache.
1,King's speech,Hated this. There's nothing about the story here. This is only for someone who has read the book and seen the movie and just love both so much they plan to immerse themselves in the idiots responsible for both. i can't enjoy watching a bunch of Hollywood types patting themselves on the back for what they perceive to be a great success; especially when I don't think it was a success..
1,Tetra pack should be the only way you sell coconut water,I bought this item loving the way it tasted in the 11.2 ounce packages but opting for more drink for your buck I went ahead and order a case of the 14 ounce plastic bottle zico. Bad Idea after my first taste I was unhappy the coconut water tasted like the plastic bottle. If you buy this product definately opt for the tetra packed 11.2 ounce product.
1,So/so,"My teenage son thought this was awful, so I took them into work. The reaction at work was lukewarm. I don't eat junk food, so I didn't try them - just going on the reactions of my son and co-workers."
2,Can't stop this feeling I got,"Do yourself a massive favour. Buy this CD, put it in your CD player and don't remove it until you are singing along.I own a few Prince CDs, (Hits B Sides, Purple Rain, 1999, SignO'Times, Batman) Graffiti Bridge is the best one.This CD just grooves - it has a funky sound, quirky, sexy lyrics and with the huge depth of talent Mavis Staples and the ,I haven't seen the movie and I don't plan to - I think it may ruin the music.The best song on the album is 'Joy in Repetition', but I could put this on repeat and listen non-stop for several days."
2,No apologies,"Quite simply. It is important for men to retain their manliness. This movie influenced me 13 years ago and now, 13 years later I can appreciate why."
2,Good for energy and vitamins,"I decided to give this a try after questioning it for 2+ years. My girlfriend and I split the count and noticed a significant difference after the first 2-days.She noticed an increase of energy and awareness at work, and I agree. It is quite a few pills, which makes it slightly less attractive that other vitamin supplements. But at the same time, just do it. If you want results from something that is truly authentic, just swallow them. My girlfriend complained at first, but she got used to the bigger ones... remember, I'm talking about the pills... perv.All-in-all, give it a shot. You'll have some nice neon, radioactive-looking urine and an increase in energy."
1,not the stuff dreams are made of,"most of the tracks on this cd are available elsewhere, but what prompts me to give this a low review is the quality of the recording. some of them sound like they were taped off of a tv set showing a warbly print. you can do better elsewhere."
2,For the lovers of music this is THE SET,"A loevly collection, with very good selections, being recorded specially for the collection at sites. Gnawa Music, Pakistan, Iran and Yemen CDs are my favourites, but I love the entire colection. This is a one that every lover of the music have to hear."
1,Boring feet,"I found this to be very boring. Most of the characters looked alike. No diverse characters like a polar bear, seal other animal than a penguin ect.The plot was extremely weak, basically a penguin tries to stop humans from eating fish in the antarctic.With the exception of ONE funny scene, the rest of the movie got boring fast.The movie was cute for 3 minutes and just dragged on until the revelation of the ridiculous plot. Preachy anti religious and just plain boring.It tried so bad to be a Disney movie but sunk beneath the ice on this one.It was propaganda disguised as a kid's movie.Go get Ice Age instead."
1,meh,mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhI used it maybe once.... with Uno.... it's kinda silly.. and pointless unless you're facemapping your face into Rainbow six vegas 1 or 2
1,Appalling,"To say that I am appalled at Mr. Mitrione's writing of this book, more specifically the book's subject matter, is an understatement. Having lived in South Florida during the time of Mitrione's employment as an FBI agent there, I am very familiar with his career and the circumstances which ended that career. It is chilling to contemplate how Mitrione researched this book by gaining information from the honest, hardworking investigators who were able to bring Grissom to justice. Even more disturbing is how Mitrione intruded into the lives and the pain of the victim's families. I agree that this story should have been told to honor the victims-especially the young women whose bodies were not recovered-their families, and the incredible dedication of the law enforcement officers. I am sorry that Mr. Mitrione was the one to tell it, and I am left wondering why he did."
1,looks like Adorama might be doing the bait and switch,"If you are reading this review for the ""Deluxe Enhancing Filter Kit"" and the price is $29.95 this is not correct. If it is $60+ then ignore this review. Adorama tells me it was a technical error, but they have yet to correct it. This leads me to believe it is the old Bait and Switch technique. They sent me a different filter kit(cheaper). I now have to refuse or ship back this totally different filter kit to get my money back. We will see how that works out."
2,Mr Mingo's review is way off,"I think this is an excellent movie. I love to see movies were racism is addressed. I think this movie is well worth the buy. And for Mr Mingo that says ""Crash"" was unworthy of an Oscar. I'm sorry to say that he must live in a fantasy world or you must not be a man of color because racism is not subtle. I am a black woman who has also traveled to other countries and I must say that I experienced racism overseas but not like I experience it here just about everyday. I would say overall they did a good job w/ this movie"
2,It's all in the technique,"I think this is the best style of cork remover as it saves the integrity of the cork so one doesn't get pieces of cork in the wine. I own several of this style of varying brands. The trick is to gently rock the prongs on either side of the cork until it is completely touching the top of the cork. Then as you are removing the cork, do so in a pulling clockwise twist motion. I've never had any problem, but a friend thinks this style is a pain and I think the same of her conventional cork damaging corkscrew. Once you get the knack of it, you'll quit using the conventional style."
2,The CD may be short but...,"you have to realize that with each single off of this album she released two b sides. That's 4 additional songs which are absolutely beautiful. Also, on the Tiwanese release there is an additional song called ""Isobella"" which is truly amazing. I love this album. It is much more upbeat than ""Watermark"" and ""Shepherds Moon"" I can't listen to it enough. My only hope is that we don't have to wait another 5 or 6 years for a new album."
1,Fell apart after 3 weeks of use,"I've been using this mat for a few weeks (everyday) for common floor workouts. Somehow, the foam material developed a huge knot in the middle of the mat right where your tailbone would hit. I gently used and properly stored it, and this kind of quality is unacceptable for this price. The comfort itself would deserve 5 stars; the durability deserves a negative 10."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Waste of money!!After one winter it died. When you turn it on, the digital display fades out after 3 seconds and the heater won't turn on.To their credit--after speaking to a Holmes representative, they are sending me a new unit free of charge and without proof of purchase. I just need to send the old unit back after I receive the new one.I hope this one works!"
1,Fairly boring,I knew it was going to be short however it was just corny. These actors had/have big names but they are not up to par with todays actors and singers.
2,This one's a keeper!,"I needed an alarm clock that doesn't shut down when the electricity goes off, one that's not too big, but can be easily seen and read. This one fits the bill perfectly!! I definitely recommend this alarm clock!"
2,My 18 month old's favorite video!,"My son has been watching this video for several months & it is still his favorite video! Everyday, he gives me the dvd to put on & watches it over & over & over. It's great for infants & toddlers because it's all music & the characters are cute little babies. My son loves music & loves to dance so it keeps him glued to the tv. He can't get enough of it! It tells several short musical ""stories"" about Baby Elmo, Cookie Monster, Big Bird & Prairie Dawn. In each story, it shows real babies & their mommies dancing too. This is a great video & a nice change from the traditional Sesame Street videos."
2,New to microwave IC measurements? This book is for you.,"This text provides an excellent introduction to many of the important aspects of measuring high speed ICs. Topics include understanding microwave measurements, calibration, practical issues pertaining to microwave and millimeter wave probing, test fixtures and on-wafer characterization. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to enter the field of microwave and millimeter wave IC measurement and characterization.Additionally, for the many engineers working in high speed optical communications (i.e. OC-192, OC-768 ...) that do not have a microwave background, this book will provide you with insight into how high speed interfaces work and what the important issues are. Many excellent references are given that will help you to probe further into any of the topics presented."
1,Beware - Not all the same book.,"Amazon has confused several different items. They have attached the ""Editorial reviews"" for a hardcover book of the Brothers Grimm's Snow White and Rose Red illustrated by Gennady Spirin and published by Philomel to a School & Library book illustrated by James Weren with cartoon-style illustrations and an adudio cassette, both published by Troll Associates. Other versions of this classic fairy tale with different illustrators have their own separate reviews as these completely different items should. When dealing with children's picture books, different illustrators create entirely different books. All the Spirin and Werren versions share is a title."
2,the start of something new here,"I don't even know where to begin to talk about this collection. First, I love Batman, he's one of my favorite character, and if handled properly, Superman can be complex and interesting too. Luckily, Jeph Loeb (who redefined Batman's early years) wrote it. He's got to be one of the great writers in the comic book world. For someone like myself who has been out of the DC universe for a while, there are some questions, like how did Luthor become president, and so on. But, even without the background information, this is a great tale."
1,Quel domage.,"I was fervently hoping that this was going to be a CD with the jazzy stylings of Charlie Biddle and his daughter Stephanie, who I saw (and loved) in The Whole Nine Yards--but, no! This is a very retro (to the '80s) and simplistic effort from Charlie Biddle JUNIOR--who sounds like a bad Ricky Martin in my estimation (and I adore Ricky's ""Vuelve,"" so don't get me wrong). Only one track, Marie Se Marie, held my interest, and that is because of the intriguing and jazzy trumpet riffs by Roger Walls in the background. Charlie, laisse votre pere vous aidez, dude!"
1,Gave it a 1 because there was no zero,I purchased this Keypix for my wife to be able to carry pictures of the grandkids with her. The quality is terrible. You can see the pixel lines troughout the pictures. I also received a cheaper keychain made by Innovage and the picture quality was 100% better. Save your money and don't buy this junk.
1,Another One Bites the Dust,"Like many others here, my camera also suddenly stopped working one day. I've had the camera exactly 2 years and have taped about 16 hours total. I also have taken very good care of it - never been dropped or damaged in any way. The Sharp-recommended repair facility wanted $40 just to look at it. I opted to send it to a facility that does free estimates... just learned it will cost $225 to fix the power source. Even though the repair shop will guarantee everything for 6 mos, we will likely spend a little extra just to buy a newer, better camera."
2,Wagan 4-way 12v socket extender,"I ordered this adapter after first ordering a different brand that wouldn't hold the 12v plugs tightly. While the inside of (3) of the accessory ports are smooth-walled, the hole diameter isn't so large that the plugs fall out or work themselves loose."
2,Return of the Eagles,"One of four books written by Follett about German POWS in WWII. It was great reading and I highly reccomend it along with the other three sequels. I have since read most of Folletts other books such as Ice, Sabre and have enjoyed them all. Hard to put down. He is a great writer. r"
2,"Great for him, sometimes tiresome for me","My 8 month old loves this toy, and I love that he loves it, but some days I just have to hide it because the little song that it sings can get really annoying. However, he does have fun banging on it with his hand and with other toys, and it will have great educational value as he gets older, so I can tolerate a tiresome tune for that!"
2,Fascinating,"I have actually met another Moroccan who claimed a similar experience. This is an interesting cultural story. The experience is one that people in Morocco that I met will say they have heard of, but it is extremely difficult to get anyone to talk about it any further. If the subject is even moderately interesting to you, buy this book."
2,Great Book,Warren Weirsbe always writes easy to read commentaries! This was an excellent book to use along with a Bible study. You can't go wrong with his study volumes.
1,whole new level of suck,"i like dillon fence and all, used to listen to em back in high school, enjoyed a good amount of their songs. but man oh man....this recording should never have been released. the sound quality is horrid. greg was singing flat over 1/2 the time...the drummer sounded like he hadn't played a drumset in years! the guitars were way too distorted, u couldn't make out the melodies/harmonies. total trainwreck. yeah i know its a live show but man i really would have had to leave after a few songs, it really is just that bad. i personally cannot recommend this to anyone! ugh!"
2,Just what I needed,"I got these for my Alex DeLarge Halloween costume and was very happy with them, I had looked around for other fake eyelashes like the ones from the movie and wasn't able to find a whole lot. I got these and they were just what I wanted. Thick long lashes, worked out great."
2,The Best Packaged Spanish Rice,"I have tried many different brands of Spanish rice, including Goya, and this is the best. I can't find in the grocery stores where I live (MD) even though the stores carry every other packaged Mahatma product. That is why I try to remember to get some whenever I order something through Amazon."
2,Good quality & functional for the price,"I purchased this based on the recommendations from Cook's Illustrated. Since I can't afford the price of All-Clad, this cookware appeared to be a good value at less than half the price. I was replacing a mish-mash of worn-out non-stick and wanted something which would last longer. I have been please with its performance.First, I had to adjust downward the burner temperatures I used on my glass-top electric stove since these pans are much more efficient. The highest level I use is slightly above half-power, and I've had no difficulties with burning or sticking. Also, do not shock hot cookware by spraying or immersing it in cold water so as to keep it from warping."
2,Anna's Eve,"Watched this movie last night, and its a great flick. Scared the pants off me, i'm still creeped out."
1,does not clean,"This looks like the exact griddle we purchased at Crate and BarrelMaybe mine is defective or my idea of clean is differentI consider clean meaning no char, grease, or residue remaining. Being it's ""non-stick"", you'd think nothing would stickDespite carefully following instructions for coating prior to use, this has gotten impossible to clean after just a couple of uses.We mostly used it for pancakes and breakfast, but the grill side is even worse.It's properly oiled and I use nylon scrubbers, which now follows overnight lengthy soaking.You even smell grease, despite washing several times after useWe've maybe used it 15-20 times in the past year and I'm ready to toss it."
2,Delightful,I love this stuff! Scent is a delight - not too much or too little; and the feel is luxurious. Will definately re-order when this runs out.
2,A glorious ride,"A brief history of UK canals, a briefer instruction on navigating our boat and then off we glide through the countryside at four MPH. Lots of scenery and a gentle patter both informative and humorous from our narrator. Spotlight visits to Chester, Edinburgh, Inverness, the Falkirk Wheel (a late 20th Century mechanical marvel) and the Wedgewood factory. A few interviews (just a word or two) along the way provide the human touch.I don't think that anyone could be disappointed with this purchase."
1,Professional Genealogy,Obviously this book was designed for the professional and is written for the professional. The amateur genealogist could be easilly snowed with all the technical jargon but once you get past these aspects there are a few things that are of value.Any amateur seeking help could do better by purchasing another source.
2,The Magus Draws His Own Way,"True. Joseph Beuys could not draw like Leonardo (who can ?). He was no Augustus John either. Neither even Pisanello who so lovingly inspired the Magus who had communicated with dead Hares and living Coyotes. But he had a certain delicacy, a touch of mystique that is unimistakable Beuys. His raw, always vulnerable, sexuality is a wonder to behold.I hardly travel any place without this neat paperback edition. Beuys is, definitely one of my top ten drafstmen (Leonardo topping the list)."
2,\m/,If you like the classic Sabbath with Dio then this is a no brainer to purchase. You get the remastered classics plus 3 new songs. I would have paid the 10.99 just for the new songs. They are very good. I wish Sign of the Southern Cross and Country Girl had been included on the CD.
1,Did not like,Hard to mix and very bland taste. I wouldn't recommend or purchase this item again. Definitely try flavors out buying a small portion.
2,Great reference!,This book is a great reference fpr those planning their home landscape. Great illustrations and helpful information - gives helpful tree/shrub size information.
2,A must for parents,"I purchased this book many years ago when I became aware of an issue with one of my children. It was a life saver and eye opener.This small book is far more powerful than you would imagine.I made a commitment to study and put it into practice. Some things did not apply to my situation but some did. It took time but it worked so well, it was like magic.Not only did our communication improve dramatically but my children became very much in touch with their feelings.They are all grown up now. All have achieved great success in their chosen careers which as you would have guessed involves a lot of communication with people.One of my children became a nurse and during nursing school her professor complimented her on her excellent communication skills. She shared this with me and thanked me for teaching her. I in turn thank Dr. Ginott for teaching me.I have subsequently passed copies on to them for their families."
2,Great from end to end,"Nice combination of the 1st 2 Allman albums from 1969 and 1970. Classics come fast with Don't Want You No More/Not My Cross to Bear, Whippin Post, Midnight Rider, Dreams, Elizabeth Reed, Revival et al."
1,Abismal,"Honestly the worst thing I have ever seen. Laughable. A horrid waste of time. I couldn't stop laughing. The acting is terrible. The plot is atrocious. Everything about this is terrible, terrible, terrible. I tried to rate it 0 stars but can't do that. I guess I'll give it 1 star since I at least had a good time laughing at this train wreck."
2,AMAZING,"This is the best book ever, as it explains many things and story's in the Lord of the rings book."
2,Dirty Diamonds revies,It got here in time for me to listen to and try to understand before I went to the Alice Cooper Concert......it helped me enjoy the concert even more.
1,Not so pleasant to use,"The description sounded great but the product was a disappointment. Instead of helping to straighten a hammer toe and relieve my discomfort, it irritated the toe and was quite uncomfortable to wear. It is possible that others with this condition may find that this product has helped them. However, I stopped using it after only one day."
1,"This book is out of print, get the 6th edition instead","This book is out of print. Get the new editionOpenGL(R) Programming Guide: The Official Guide to Learning OpenGL(R), Version 2.1 (6th Edition) (OpenGL)instead. I was on the wait queue for restocking for a month before I realized my mistake."
1,RIO Carbon Volume Knob Keep Breaking,"I bought a 5 GB RIO Carbon about 2 years ago. After one year the volume knob broke, so I returned it, paid $100 and got a replacement. About 2 months later the replacement died, so I paid another $100 and got another replacement. Now the third replacement volume knob broke (without any dropping etc.) I wish I never bought a RIO. It has a serious design flaw. Buy an MP3 player with no moving parts. I should have bought an Ipod, as I have now spent far too much money continuously repairing/replacing my RIO. Also not there is no shuffle mode on it either which would have been a nice feature."
2,Bluetooth,"I thought this bluetooth headset was a little below par as far as quality. It had static in the background whenever I used it. I gave it to my son though, and he loves it."
2,"Math? Okay, now we get it.","After going over this well written book, it is much easier to assist my two children with their homework. I give it an A+, and look for future ideas from this gifted writer."
1,What trailer park do these people live in?,"A classic story of a blossoming relationship playing out against an old lover's triangle. I found the relationship between the sheriff and Liesel to be much more interesting than the two brothers fighting over an underachieving woman like two little children fight over a toy. Unfortunately, the book focuses more on the trailer-park antics of drunken, drug using convict brothers rather than the sheriff and his new found romance.I believe Mr. Smolens could really write a good descriptive story if he didn't have to pepper it with four letter words and sleazy situations. I'm not clear as to whether this is his own idea or something his publishers believe will sell books. In either case, this tactic sold one book, but will not sell any more to me."
2,Real men wear Carhartt work shorts. At least that's what my husband thinks.,"My husband was thrilled when his Carhartt shorts arrived. He loves the heavier weight of these shorts, and all the different pockets. When the shorts were dirty and my husband threw them in the wash, he kept asking me if they were done yet. They have become his favorite shorts. The quality and fit are perfect. The shipping was very fast. It was a perfect purchase all the way through the process."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I bought this because I love both of the main actors, but it was much more depressing of a movie than I like to watch during the holiday times."
1,Terrible!,This movie was terrible!! So predictable. It could have been such a good concept too. Very disappointing. Save your money and skip this one.
1,Rip off,This DVD and the two companion DVD's were a complete rip off. $14.95 each and they were only ten minutes each!! No where did I see that in the description of them. The ten minutes each was a very superficial description of the Hermitage. I am returning these expecting a full refund.For anyone considering these DVD's my suggestion is to find some other source for your information about St. Petersburg and the Hermitage. Nick Gotten
1,What a disappointment !,"Having been fascinated by Mr. Dunnes television comentaries on the Simpson case, I looked forward to this book. What a disappointment! Mr.Dunne, with his acess to the trial participants,plus his personal experiance as a crime victim could have written THE book on the Simpson Murders.Instead,we got a book which was as shallow as Gus Bailey's Hollywood cronies. I suspect that Dominic Dunne was so disgusted , rightly so, in the outcome of the trial that his heart wasn't in this book.Perhaps because he had publicly said during the trial that he was going to write this book he felt obligated to do so.I for one,wish he hadn't. Kevin J. Morgan"
1,too small for large dogs,"I did not like these, they said they lasted long an for big dogs.My dogs swollowed them whole and did not even chew them"
2,Good trainer at a good price,"This trainer is a good cost effective investment for the semi-serious rider. It is compact, durable, and low-priced. It is very easy to set up, but I did have to change the skewer on my back wheel to use it. For off-season training you can't beat the quality for the price."
1,How did this movie win an award?,"In a word, Bad. I was told this was a good movie.Someone lied to me. How did this make it to the academy?"
1,Great Christmas Movie for the family,This was excellent and I will make arrangements to purchase the sequal to it. I sure used lots of kleenex during this DVD. I know that I will watch it with family and friends during the Christmas season this year.
2,Pleasant read,"I love Robert Parker, but think he is a bit less successful writing the female ""voice"", even though he insists Joan helps him with this! Sunny still sounds a bit like Spenser to me. But I love reading these books anyway....."
1,"Good video game, Bad anime",The anime is just plain crap! It doesn't follow the video game and it twelve episodes were so lame. It's bad just like Arc the Lad anime.
1,Disapointed!,"PSYCH-K is a big disapointment. This book does nothing to help. All it does is tell the reader that they need to find the ""live"" classes with paid instructors. This is the worst book I have ever gotten from Amazon."
2,Excelen CD for Pearl Jam lovers,"If you are a Pearl Jam fan, this CD will give you 100% satisfaction. If you do not know much about this group, let me tell you that, in my opinion is the best one in the decade."
1,short,to short thought there would be more and will read before i order another movie at a 1.99. I wish I knew how to delete it off my page
1,"Junk. Didn't work with my multi-function, then died a little over a year later.","This was my first, and only, purchase of a Linksys product. I unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer, then hooked it up to another printer, only to have it die just out of warranty. A completely worthless piece of Chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer doesn't even stand behind it."
2,A Classical Introduction to the Field,"Wilkie Collins is best remembered for two books: ""The Moonstone"" and ""The Woman in White"". Both of them are great achievements in the mystery field. The narration style is unique and the plot is well developed around the tale of the diamond. Keeps you right on the edge until the very end. It is strongly recommended."
2,Great Game.... Top 5 ever,"So much fun, I'm playing it again.One of the best games played, since Dark Age of Camelot, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and a few others.First, this is the first game since Far Cry to actually STRESS a system I built. With an AMD X2 3800+ (OC'ed to 4800), 1024MB RAM, BFG 6800OC AGP, I was unable to turn on all the Graphics, but after trying out the ""System Test"" was able to play it with:2x AA8x AFComputer Settings: HighGraphics Settings: Custom (Mostly Med/High)Shadows cause huge reduction in frames/sec but is worth the performance loss. Makes the game so much more creepy.Perfect game from anyone 17 or older per the MA rating."
1,Isaac's Mom,"The box says that this game is for 4-7 year olds. When my 4 yr old son got this last year we discovered that the box couldn't even read 30 years and up. Both my hubby and my brother tried to play this game unsuccessfully. The problem is that the pizza surface is too slick and the pieces will not stay balanced up there. The toppings though are really well made and Isaac had fun making pretend pizza with them but we were never able to play the game. it was a disappointment b/c it looked so cute. We bought Topple instead this year, which is the same concept."
2,Mostly satisfied,This product was delivered in a timely manner. My whole family enjoy this product - both taste and texture are very good. The only reason I have not given the hot dog buns 5 stars is that one pack has gone mouldy - several months prior to the exparation date and within a sealed pack! A review of packaging perhaps?
1,Don't bother,Did not ship well. Returned and had 3 more reshipped. Two out of three were once again opened and contents spilled all over. My cats don't like it nearly as much as what I can pick up for less at WalMart. Was seriously disappointed.
1,Interesting plot...falls short of potential....NOT FOR KIDS!,"I purchased this novel, intending to give it as a gift. The description was enticing, the plot promising - a hero travels back in time to Scotland to fight dragons, meet the Loch Ness monster, and share his adventures with the reader. Unfortunately, the character development is lacking and I found myself not caring about the hero or any other character. More importantly, this book was recommended for kids, but it is NOT appropriate for children. The main ""romance"" scene is far too graphic for teens, and there are other inappropriate passages as well. Fans of the fantasy/romance genre may appreciate this novel, but it is not for everyone."
1,Leo should have Sank with the shark like in Titanic,I saw this movie in the tropical Cancun and even with Spanish subtitles I was dissapointed. Now the Dvd did it little more justice. The truth is the movie had an amazing backdrop and a sound score to match but like many of Leo's movies the script and plot were lacking in every major area. If the script had been as well constructed as that island was beautiful this movie could have taking more awards than I can count. I personally think Leo is has bit of inate talent but if he continues to take scripts and movies directed like this he wont be able to act himself out of a wet paper bag.
2,Once Upon a Potty -- Girl,Great potty training book for potty training.... There is one for boys and one for girls.... I have been giving for gifts for years... Cute idea for new baby shower.... IF you know the sex of the baby ahead of time.!!
2,"Mum, 8 year old daughter & 5 year old son LOVE it.","This is a hit! My daughter didn't like the look of it when she got it for Xmas as she had preconceived ideas about what sort of kids play chess. When we finally played it late January she decided she loves it, as do I and as does her 5 year old brother. They ask me ""Can we play No Stress Chess please"". A fantastic way to introduce chess. I always regretted never having learnt to play and now I can learn as well. I highly recommend this game........"
1,"Extremely basic, but hard to follow","This text was a real disappointment to me. Having taught microbiology for a number of years and looking for something to expand my understanding and knowledge of the field of virology, I was sorry that I added this book to my reference library. All in all, I found it to be poorly written and only slightly informative; at least from my perspective."
1,Believe the reviews! This thing is a leaker straight out of the box!,"We really thought this would work out to the a good mattress right up till our company slept on it. The very first night it had to be refilled. Thinking it just might be typical stretching of an air bed, the second night went about the same. After the third night of about 1/2 of the air was gone. This was the very first time it had been used. We sent it back for a refund. It's to bad since it seemed to be of decent quality and certainly was reported comfortable while it lasted."
2,"Quick, Easy and Delicious","I bought this book because I don't have alot of time to cook dinner. I also happen to like Thai food. I had no idea I would use it as much as I do. Almost everything can be cooked in one wok or pan. Most of the recipes can be made within a half hour. Best of all, it has really opened my mind to using ingredients I have not been accustomed to using, such as fish sauce and chile paste. Although I had to order some of the ingredients, they keep for a long time and the recipes in this book use them so often that there is no wasting money by buying an ingredient I will only use in one or two dishes. I use this cookbook at least twice per week for dinner. Very highly recommended."
2,bomberman is the bomb!,"THIS IS A GREAT GAME BUT THE GRAPHICS ARE POOR. THE BEST PART IS WHEN YOU PLAY THE BATTLE GAME.THE NORMAL GAME YOULL PROBABLY NEED A GUIDE BOOK FOR IT , IF THERE IS. I REQUEST THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE."
2,worked as said,"got the fobs within the time specified, had trouble with one, called and they sent me another one with no problems"
2,An Awesome BSB Book!,I am a huge Backstreet Boys fan and I have to say that this book is amazing. I own many Backstreet Books and this is the best one I've seen yet. The pictures are awesome! It is the coolest book out in the market and for any BSB fan it is a must have!
1,A Shaver from Houston,"A great Shaver! Unfortunately the power module failed within the first 90 days of service. It's been two months since I took to the service center, and they can't get parts from Norelco. A great shaver, but you have to offer better service than this."
2,I wish the show never ended....,"This was really really good, it wasn't what I expected at all. I wish the show didn't end the way that it did but I truly enjoyed how they made this one (should of been a little longer though....lol)...."
2,Leave your hypocrisy at the door,"If you are going to be offended and not enjoy a little humor, please don't buy this. On the other hand, if you enjoy good humor and some laughs, get this DVD. Enjoyed the show and hope that this is not all from this talented comedian."
2,Awesome Graphic Novel - best read without knowing the story! (beware plot spoilers in most of the other reviews),"Bechdel rocks as a comic artist for over 20 years.This book is a huge, surprising, candid, funny, serious, revealing slice of her real (you-can't-make-this-stuff-up) life. (and the art is so pleasant)If you like this kind of work, spend the ten bucks, you won't be sorry.PStry to read it without reading about the story/plot in a review, the story really twists and turns and all that will be lost if you hear about it in some blunt summary!"
1,Don't get too excited about number 4,"Firstly, I loved Diana's other books, hero-worshipped Jamie (like everyone else) but...I am sooo bored with this book. I take it to bed at night, and after about 2 pages am asleep, it has now taken me about 3 months and I'm only a quarter of the way through, and I am only reading the rest in the hope that it may improve. I feel Claire & Jamie's relationship has been dragged out to the bitter end, and to be quite honest, I don't think I'd be very upset if a wild Grizzly bear broke in and killed them both (it would be a bit more exciting). Who is interested in the sex life of two people around 50 years old, settled & happily married! Boring."
2,bueno,"es bonito pero me parece que no esta bien diseñado el interior y los bolsillos, ya q no hay espacio para los cables ni el cargador de la bateria, siendo el bolso mas grande que las camaras cybershot"
1,Not pleased...,"The reason I decided to purchase this product was because the trimmer in the picture is slim and compact. I needed a slim, compact trimmer that would fit well in my travel case. The trimmer I received is nothing like the trimmer in the picture. It's not the same trimmer at at. Same brand, but totally different. It is bulky and that defeats the purpose for me. I already have a bulky trimmer, I wanted a slim one.As for functionality, it's not the worst...but still rather unimpressive. It makes a great deal of noise, but doesn't remove much hair. It doesn't cut as close as I would like it to either...it leaves stubble and I end up having to finish the job with a normal razor, which is hard when your just trying to touch up. When shaving with the little light on the device becomes how very quickly.All and all, I am not pleased. To the seller, you need to update your pictures and send the item you show, not something different."
2,Following Her Heart,This is one of my favorite movies. Ann-Margret did such great job of showing how a woman can move beyond an abuse situation and become the person that she knew she always wanted to be. In the process finding someone to really love and care about her.
1,"Nice watch, as long as it worked","I liked this watch when I first received it. But it stopped working after a few weeks. It might just have been the battery. But a new watch costing several hundred dollars should not have problems in only a few weeks, so I returned it. Bummer."
1,"the word is ""lousy""","I had a good feather duster a few years back, but I no longer have it, and now that I own some fragile items, I wanted a new duster to keep them clean. From the moment I lifted this feather duster out of its packaging, it dropped small bits of feathers. It keeps dropping them everywhere it's carried. You can't use this to clean; it leaves more behind than it picks up. At this cheap price, it's not worth my time re-packing and sending back, but it's useless. I'll be throwing it out. Save your time and money and buy a better duster. If they had a ""zero star"" option I'd use it."
2,My secret weapon!!!,"Great product great smelling, and a blessing they discontinued it so I don't have to worry about any of my friends picking it up at the local mall..."
2,Cute,"This is a cute pendant and a steal at $63 shipped. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the gold chain is very thin but what could one expect at that price? For what I paid it's a good price for the pendant alone. I am going to use one of my own chains because I am afraid that one little tug and the chain will break and bye bye pendant -- that's how thin it is. Like the other reviewers, the pendant was larger than I expected. Don't get me wrong, it's not large by any means but from the measurments I was expecting something the diameter of a pencil eraser and it is a bit larger. I will take a picture within the next couple of days next to a dime for perspective and post it under user images."
2,It does what it's supposed to,"I've read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment. I only get spots when I try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head. It will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles. This really is not a tabletop item, it has to be used on the floor. I've used it on just about all my cloths: khakis, polos, button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job. If I have one complaint about it, it is that the cord is too short. and with the steamer on the floor, it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook. I also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir (which is only 8 oz.) with out removing the hose. Overall, I think for the price that I paid, I got my moneys worth, after all it's just a tea kettle with a hose."
1,"You've probably heard this already, but...","The DRM. Seriously. Unlike many other people, I found this game quite enjoyable; admittedly there are many points where it gets monotonous, bland, a waste of your creativity...... but I still enjoyed it when I played it. Uh, when it didn't crash for no apparent reason and lose all my progress because it doesn't autosave and I hadn't the forethought to save manually, that is.However I did not enjoy it when I ran out of installs. At that point, EA told me I couldn't play the game I'd purchased anymore.I'm still blown away by that response."
2,Adorable,"They are small as another reviewer noted, but they are quite beautiful and well made. I got them to give as a present and have no qualms about how well they might be received. I'm happy."
2,If you only read one book this year read this one.,"This book is so good ! A danger is that it might persuade other authors that the cyber-punk genre now has been perfected as an art form and they can give up. Even in the context of a ""mystery and pursuit"" novel it is truly great, John Buchan may never have bothered with The 39 Steps if he had to beat this one. He does the capitalism red in tooth and claw scene as well as William Gibson and evokes the wonder of the far future on a par with Cordwainer Smith, who he generously credits. (Probably wondering how many kids today have read ""The Game of Rat and Dragon"".) Wonderful escapism, tension, plot...how do you get hold of a Hugo award nomination form ?"
2,Didn't Want It To End...,"Helen makes this story so enticing you want just don't want it to end! This is a book that I could not put down and enjoyed very much! Great fun for all ""adult"" pirate fans. Super historical information and the characters lept off the page! The story plot is interesting and fun as well as the characters, Tiola and Jesamiah and others are well developed and very real! Huzzah to Helen Hollick!"
1,DOA !,"Followed instructions and charged battery (did so for 12 hrs) before use. Put together, oiled chain, pulled trigger and NOTHING. Checked connections and even put battery in charger again, but never would run. Sending back but now Amazon is out of stock so cannot get a replacement now when I need to use it."
2,Inspirational & different.,"Guidance to not only healthier lifestyle, but the whole body/spirit/mind connection. Easy and powerful read, saturated with poignant quotes. Proved to be very helpful while dealing with illness in the family. Highly recommended."
2,One of the Best on the Enemy,"Dr. Mayhue unmasks Satan and allows us to biblically see our Adversary. The book does not deal with demons or the demonic realm as much as he deals with the person of Satan. The book covers nearly every Scripture on Satan and exposes his lies, his tactics, and how to defeat him through Christ.One of the best things about this book is that Dr. Mayhue does not spend time chasing dreams and men's ideas about Satan. Too much confusion exists about the Enemy and most comes from strange (even unbiblical) ideas about Satan. Dr. Mayhue avoids this and simply gives us a biblical view of Lucifer."
2,Not as romantic or sexy as some of Ms. Henke's books,"This novel lacks the erotic love scenes and some of the sexual tension of Shirl Henke's other novels, but it's still a good read. Also recommend ""Yankee Lord."""
1,Buyer Beware,"In the photo of these earrings, the setting appears to be substantial. In reality, it much too delicate and flimsy for stones of this size."
1,Nice and convenient but crashed after two days,"The ipod crashed, and then it also infected my computer with some type of virus or conflictual software. Then my computer crashed so I had to restore it entirely (with hp unable to ship me a restoration cd for my media center for over a month) and reload all the software additions and updates that I had installed on it for over a year. Overall, looks like a great device, but for me was just a terrible experience. I ended up returning it and getting a refund. Amazon customer service is the one perfect thing in online buying..."
1,A poor piece of work,"As a computer professional, I found this movie both pointless and technically flawed. As a previous reviewer has stated, this movie is indeed not ABOUT Hackers, but rather, it is a sterotyped look at at ego maniac cyberpunks who haven't a clue how to use a computer or what to do with one. The use of psychadelic colors throughout the movie is sickening, the plot is weak and disjointed, and the movie's title should have been named ""teenage cyber-dropouts from wonderland"". Do yourself a BIG favor and rent either Wargames (Old, but has a good storyline) or Sneakers instead."

1,A Rose by any other name ...,"Despite what Moore may have had in mind while writing this novel, her combination of florid, poetic prose and graphic sex and violence just don't mix. This book is the literary equivalent of a snuff film. Never mind what Moore was trying to achieve (and her radiant, angelic author photo on the hardcover edition makes it seem as if she sees herself as literature's savior)with her story, underneath the prose, there is a by the numbers thriller full of red herrings, the obligatory surprise revelation, and a violent, sick ending that tries to go one better than ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar."" Whatever Moore was trying to say gets lost amidst the gore and sex. This is a novel best forgotten."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I was expecting it to help me identify and process feelings, and it seemed like it just kept blaming all my feelings on in-utero and birth experiences. While I believe there is some truth to that, the book spent way too much time going over problems in-utero and during delivery. It took way to long to get to any pertinent information to help healing. I do not recomend this book."
1,This book has no substance and is mostly a chronology .,There seems to be no INSIDE STORY told here. Little more than what you would read in a newspaper. Evidently the arthur is bound by some Government legal oath which prevents him from writing anything of consequence. A piece of milk toast.
2,Relaxing,"I did the PM workout first one evening and felt immediately relaxed, centered, and grounded. It is very easy to follow. The viewer can simply 'mirror' the forms, i.e., Cole faces the camera and the viewer moves as though Cole were a mirror image. I tried other videos and DVDs in the past where the instructor would turn all different ways and it was impossible to follow for me. Not here. Very good for a beginner like me. LOVED the PM workout. I was instantly relaxed and that day's stress felt lifted away. Very enjoyable. Anyone who can stand for 30 minutes at a stretch can do this."
1,Wasn't Very Funny,This performance just wasn't up to the standard that Williams has done in the past. I was disappointed because I think he is a great comedian.
2,An excellent telling of the history of man's first flight.,"Fred Kelly did a wonderful job in bringing the story of the Wright Brothers to the public in this birgraphy. He starts us off by showing us the environment that the brothers grew up in and how the two had a curious and experimential nature about them. We are then shown the methods they had used in their experimentations for developing their flying machine. We can even feel the edge of competition as Samual Langly makes his attempt at manned powered flight only a day before the brothers and is met with failure.It has been 100 years since that magical day on the North Carolina Outter Banks, and Kelly manages to bring the experience back to us to relive. This is also an excellent book for children to read. I highly recommend it."
1,Buyer be ware!,I hate this equipment. It is the worst (fill in the blank)! Poring liquid out of the mixer without making a huge mess is impossible! Only buy it if you are willing to clean up a huge mess every time you use it! Good Luck!
1,Too lightweight,"Handles are cheesy plastic, much too lightweight. Not as sharp as some I've had in the past.Not recommended"
1,Vernon Let-It-Be-Over Little,"One of the worst novels I have read...ever. Not as bad as Ellis' Crooked Little Vein, but pretty bad. I felt there was no real character development; if anyone says that they can relate to Vernon, they are lying. Everything about the book's dialog and narration is choppy. It all appeared to be useless rambling that I just knew was going to point somewhere in the end...but it didn't. We all get that it is a satire and not necessarily a ""laugh-out-loud""-er like Catcher, but I remember laughing harder at J.Swift than this piecer. Really, this novel does nothing for the reader. I heard a lot of positive things about Vernon God Little, but it did little to capture.And now I am rambling just as bad as Pierre did starting page one."
2,Great Product,We bought this wagon because my six month old daughter was having hip surgery and would be in a half-body cast for six weeks. The doctor suggested finding a wagon to take her places because she wouldn't fit in the stroller with the cast. The Discovery Wagon has been perfect. The fact that it doesn't have seats inside was a big bonus. The ice chest is hidden under the wagon so the base is flat and made it much easier to prop her inside the wagon. We are very happy with it.
1,Trouble,Things started out alright but the LED screen burnt out and then the camera stoped transferring pictures to the docking station. So far the camera has had more down time then up time.
2,15 year son doesn't want to wear anything else.,Before I bought these sandals for my son I made him promise that he would wear other shoes when I asked him to. He would still rather wear these sandals.
2,Best chicken soup base ever,"This is my secret ingredient. Recently I went to Sam's Club to get my supply, and they had McCormick's... NOT THE SAME !!!I am waiting to find a supply somewhere. I make my own stock, but add some of this for exta depth of flavor to my homemade noodles, chicken vegetable soup, and a quick gravy with the pan drippings. I hope this product is still being made."
1,For this movie read the one and two star reviews first ..........,"If you don't know how lame it is possible for a movie to be, watch this. Then you will know.This is the kind of movie that people leave off resumes and hope no-one will remember. There are occasional laughs, but most of the scene set-ups are so dopey that they pull you straight out of the movie and make you wonder what the director was thinking. The script is so bad that I guess he didn't have many options. Or maybe he got something better and then destroyed it. You won't know, and you won't care. You will just wish you had watched something else."
1,poor quality,Faceplate on display popped off on 8th use. It loses connection in the cigarette lighter if its bumped and the station needs to be reset over and over. P.o.s product in my opinion. I like the old ones that have the manual dial setting.
2,Good Advice,"It was an interesting book. I agree with many of the ideas in the book. Still, I feel it is based for executives working in a cooperate office. I think it would be nice to have something similar geared toward people working in smaller businesses or just for getting things done at home."
1,Very little information,"This is a great style of Martial Art with many, many techniques and options but this DVD is really a SHORT introduction with really only two key techniques shared here and one exercise of value.There is simply not enough here to recommend this purchase. I'll keep because it's more of a hassle to return and easier to share or give away to a friend."
2,Thanks Ellen!,"Please be careful reading the not so nice reviews. Remember, the title is Bridgehampton Weekends, and the words easy and casual are in there too. We all know the Hamptons are not known for their, shall we say, ""regular"" people. However, Mrs. Wright has given us a wonderful cookbook with many good ideas, etc. For our Easter dinner yesterday, I made her Beef Rib Roast with Yorkshire pudding and it was fabulous. She also has lots of little shortcuts and tips to help along the way. And her foolproof piecrust is perfect! Her writing is warm and inviting and I hear she has another book coming out soon. I urge you to ignore the ""consipracy"" review and try this book. You just may come away with a few new delicious recipes. Good luck!"
2,"some riveting pages, some story","after reading reviews here by others, I will stick to the book even though I abhor the enormity of the number of pages contained in this book. I cannot believe that it could not be condensed somewhat. Almost 1200 pages! Surely some of it is superflous and should have been excised. But the reviews on this book will insure that I finish it, even though I avoid books of this size. It is initially overwhelming but these reviews do encourage me to persevere and finish it. Onward! But the first few pages made me think I would not be able to continue, did not capture my attention. It may seem silly to complain about the size of the book but I doubt I am alone in this issue. It does ramble in places but I'm only on page 101."
1,Not made in Spain,"I just received my order of six (6) packages or Artesano True Rustic Style Chorizo - advertised as made in Spain. What I received is clearly marked made in the USA. I have not opened or tasted the chorizo, but clearly disappointed about the misrepresentation."
1,Drivers CD given with this sucks,"i bought this player last week , today i received it , but when i tried to install the drivers on my laptop they doesn't install and there is no way of loading songs in this mp3playercan anybody help me with thisi liked the piece but wht the use when i am not able to load songs into it thought my laptop . my laptop has wondows XPso plz help me"
1,Very Anticlimactic,"I had to FORCE my way through two-thirds of the book because it was drawn out and aimless. I was hoping that after all of Inman's suffering and persistance to get back home to be with Ada that they would typically live happily ever after. BUT NNOOOO...This ""romantic story"" left me with the impression that they weren't even happy to see each other when they finally reunited. However, I did get a good sense of what the War was like and if the book would have been about just Inman's experience rather than giving it a romanic twist, then I wouldn't have expected a happier outcome because war is hell."
1,Do NOT order if season is not right,This did not work for me. I ordered it too late and they did not hatch. You must get this at right time of year for their life cycle or they will be DOA. Company should NOT sell these if they are not viable at that time of year...
2,Not bad- actually better than i thought,great production- for their intent of making a ganster cd- the lyrics match the topics. what else? people review this comparing it to other styles. this is a ganster cd. review accordingly.
2,Very compelling but [...],This book was very compelling on the subject about our values as humans to society. Our worth to society defined by our age or what physical condition we're in. We're at the mercy of Dr's and Judges who have decided our value to society is up [...]
2,Great for new Directors,This product I got for my daughter who is in a Directing class in college. This book explains many features of directing especially if you're new which she is. This book is helping her out a lot!
1,Weird!,It is a hard movie to follow because it moves back and forth in time so often. It is to say the least...a very very weird movie. It was confusing at times and it was too slow of a pace for me. I would not recommend this movie at all.
1,Too Bad Big Foot Didn't Steal this Book Before I Read it!,"This collection of short stories fell very short of my expectations. Granted I had never heard of Joan Hess but the praise for Joan Hess reviews on the back all claimed she was an extremely funny writer so hence that is what I expected. Humour however is not contained within this novel, it is not that her jokes or comedy scenes weren't funny, it is just that they do not exist at all. This book is a B grade thriller but certainly not a humorous collection of stories. The quality of those stories as thrillers is also rather average. The stories are predictable and many an effort to stick with as well. Give this book a miss!"
2,traditional Christmas songs in an upbeat tempo/format,this album gives an upbeat flair to the traditional songs of Christmas - a delight to listen to when you want more of a Caribbean flavor to your holiday music. All the words are clear and Estafon gives her great voice to some of the classic sounds of the season
2,any question about pregnancy? here is the answer,"I am reviewing this book for my website - www.soloyoga.com - as it is a book I recommend for the yoga teacher training I conduct in Milano Italy. As yoga teachers we have also pregnant women in normal classes and have to take care of their condition with the do and do nots.The anatomical illustrations are very clear and what is especially helpful is how the author stresses the role of the partner, who is also active in the whole process. excellent the suggestions for labour and what happens after, I have given this book to more than one pregnant student and of course my own daughter mother of 3!"
1,Tuna is critically endangered species now :(,"DO NOT BUY THIS! SAVE THE TUNA.We are scooping fish out of the oceans at such a diminishing rate, there will be oceans with no fish in 30 yrs timeAct now, it's now or never."
2,Great Instrumental Rock CD,"I really like this CD and listen to it often. I'm a huge instrumental rock guitar fan and have been playing guitar for 17 years. If you like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai, I definetely recommend this CD because it is up there with the best. Paul Gilbert is an incredible guitar player and has been releasing music since 1986 (Racer X, Mr. Big, solo albums). I plan on buying some Racer X and Paul Gilbert solo CD's because I've liked all the songs I've heard over the years. Paul does a song for Eddie Van Halen (his guitar hero and mine) on this CD and I thought that it was a really cool thing to do. Maybe we could see them play on an album together someday! Rock on..."
2,"Punk, Rave, and adorable!","I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. The boots, if you slit the back the rest of the way down, fit my girl for photographing purposes, but the backs of her feet don't fit completely. I love the fact that the boots have hidden velcro on the back to keep them from opening or falling off...really great quality! The skirt is a bit too poufy, but easily flattened. Great little leggings, adorable skirt, and beautiful corset style top in black velvet! Really sweet, and looks great on MSDs!"
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD!,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. BAD BAD BAD BAD
1,Easy way to flip the egg,The pan is the perfect size for cooking one egg. Like many of the other reviews on here have mentioned the handle is hot and will burn your hand. Also it is nearly impossible to flip the egg in this with any type of spatula. My solution is to pick up the pan w/ a mitt and flip the egg into another pan.This pan creates more work than it solves
2,Family fun!,"My daughter watched this DVD set at age two and up(she is six now). The set was damaged over the years with the little one handling disks. This is one of her favorites especially Casper the friendly ghost. This is just a replacement for her collection. For age 2 to 4 she also liked the ""Underdog"" DVD set and age 4 to 6 the""H.R. Puffin stuff"" DVD set."
1,No Hint of Talent in a Baseless Depiction of Reality by Paranoid Men,"This film was poorly executed based on a mediocre screenplay. This 1992 low budget B movie portrayed a shallow concept with a heartless plan to unfairly depict single females as psycho who have affection for one another while making men out to be deeply caring and misunderstood angelics. This film is a paranoid man's fantasy and take on reality. Someone recommended this to me based on my believing the film Pacific Heights to be a good roommate horror flick. It wasn't anywhere near the quality production of PH, not by a long shot. I regret purchasing this DVD. It was a total waste of money that I would have preferred to donate to the ASPCA. People who think this is a good movie like nudity, S&M, bondage, blood, gore, sex and ugly women with strange haircuts."
1,Stay away!,"Movie quality was horrible, it was fuzzy, it skipped and the sound was all over the place. I wish I would have watched it sooner so I could have returned it"
2,All around great game!,Bought this for my kids when it first came out. I played it more than they did! It is a game for all ages and with quite a few challenging scetions to beat.
2,Deprogramming from cults,"This book helps expose the evils of many so-called ""religious"" groups that use brain-washing tactics to deceive their followers into becoming fanatics. The book is an excellent exposé of the tactics used, as well as basic insight into the true, and dangerous nature of many cults. In an era of religious tolerance for everything, it seems, except Christianity, books like this are invaluable in pointing out that not all religions are so ""holy""."
2,FURminator review,"I purchased the FURminator deShedding Tool to use on my two cats. One has short hair, the other long hair. I mainly bought this for the long haired cat because her fur gets tangled and matted. The FURminator works so well, it pulls up a lot of the loose fur. The cats don't like it, but they tolerate it (but they also do not like regular cat brushes either). Yes, you do get fur ALL over you and the floor, but honestly it's worth it. Just change your clothes and vacuum up the cat fur off the floor.This is more expensive than a tradition cat brush but it works so much better. Definitely worth the investment!"
1,Waste of time and money,Don't waste your money ... trust me! This book tries to cover all areas of Oracle without providing much information on any single topic. It's basically one thick catalog of Oracle products.
2,Tie Dye Hoodie,Great product and fast shipping. Have purchased from in the past and would buy from again!
1,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I liked some of Britney's older songs but was never moved enough to buy an of her albums or CD singles. However, when I heard the duet with Madonna off this album I thought it was very catchy, even though the song certainly sounds like it's against REAL music. Then, when I heard that Britney had actually written some songs on here and that she was going for a more adult audience, I decided to buy it today since in it's first week it is available extremely cheap.Let's just say I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this CD. The single with Madonna is the only decent song on this CD, and let's just say Britney can't write any songs. At least she tried, right?All in all, I do not recommend this album. The songs aren't catchy and all sound alike-like one big swirling mess.I'm taking my copy to the used CD store shortly!"
2,Pretty Nice,"I haven't had to use speakers in a while, and I found these while over at our target. It was on clearance so I figured why not.It was worth the $35 I spent on it. The sound comes out nice, not like the tingy noise the old speakers my fiancé tried to pass off on me.I hook up my ipod to this and the sound comes out very nice. I like that feature so I don't have to put back all of my music on from my laptop to my new computer.It was a bit of a pain for me to get them to work, had to figure out the right way to hook them up to the computer. So that took off a star, I did figure it out after an hour or so. Then again I'm not much for getting around hardware."
2,The Knitters Book of Finishing Techniques,This book is filled with very clear instructions for many techniques I have yet to try. I would recommend it to all knitters-new and experienced.
2,Lots of fun!!!,"My 2 year old daughter is having a great time. She is very tall for her age, I wouldn't recommend for a small 2 year old. Bounce is great. Super easy to inflate, takes only about 45 seconds and clean up is easy as well. If you have a child who likes to jump this a great toy."
2,Phillip Kao and Hwang Jang Lee Fist and Foot fest!,"Some of the best onscreen fights ive seen, almost think they were actually trying to kill each other. Once again Hwang Jang Lee is the villian, But it only adds to his amazing martial arts skills. Phillip Kao is also mesmorizing in a class act performance. One of the more confrontational final duels ive witnessed, and massive replay value. May not be a popular movie to many, but a definate must see!"
2,Alive With Alzheimer's,"This book was fantastic! It really captured life (real life) with this disease. In fact, it made me feel as though I knew the residents and was appreciating their quality of life along with them. I suppose working in the same setting encourages those thoughts. And, for those who have or are taking care of a loved one now, I imagine they also will be able to relate.I, as a program director of Hearthstone Alzheimer Care, was encouraged to do better at my work, your book was refreshing. I got some ideas and was reminded the importance music has with this disease.My sister, who has very little knowledge or interaction with people having this disease, read through the book and was touched.The pictures really did say it all. I liked that you had a number of sequence pictures. I think the book shows the genuine reality of Silverado. The residents are happy, they are excited about life and engaged."
2,Jackass comes home for Christmas,"Elf-Man is a very cute Christmas comedy that is, I assume, directed at kids and families, but is something that I enjoyed, as well. Full of lighthearted comedy, slapstick antics, and heart tugging moments, it is sure to be a Christmas staple for years to come. A heartwarming Christmas comedy with a superhero...sign me up."
1,Poor quality control,The DVD arrived on time as per shipping. When we played disc 1 there was a lot of problems getting the DVD to play without stopping. On examination there were several large scratches across the disc. This was a new DVD and therefore this was down to sheer bad quality control. The scratch could not possibly have been missed at the packaging stage. So someone thought they would try to slip this through. Very disapppointed.
2,EXCELLENT,"OUTSTANDING BLACK GAY MOVIE, LOGO NEEDS TO BRING THIS TO THE NETWORK AS A SERIES AND ALSO NOAH'S ARC.. STORYLINE IS HONEST AND TRUE TO YOUNG GAY BLACK MEN."
1,Most DVD's skip.,"My DVD skips about 29 into the movie. Tried numerous Bluray and DVD player, my Mac DVD player, it skipped on all of them. Amazon knows there's problems because the customer service rep said there was a note on the item if it gets returned to ask where the movie skips and more info. She said that usually means Amazon is about to take them off their site so people don't order defective products. I got the refund and paid a bit extra for the new Bluray version of this movie made by a different company."
1,Terrible!,"This is one of the most user UN-friendly devices I have ever purchased. I have several bluetooth devices which are easy to setup and work great. These headphones take a great deal of trial and error and guest work to set up. When I finally did get them up and running, the sound quality was very disappointing.I am amazed how (apparently) difficult it is to build good sounding stereo headphones (I could care less about stereo phonecalls). I would give this product ""0"" stars-but that is not an option."
1,this book is awful,"unless you are already comfortable with xlib programming, save your money. look elsewhere. this book will NOT make you a better xlib programmer. it simply takes the place of the man pages and has some examples to supplement them.it makes no effort to teach anything."
1,Not so good,This lantern does throw bright light. BUT it does not have a long battery life. It is also prone to go out when walking with it. I think the batteries shift around.
2,A blast from the past.,A trip down memory lane with this movie. A real blast from the past and Sly is at his 80's very best in this Comic Book based movie.
2,Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix,"Harry Potter and the Order of PhoenixByDakota LawrenceThe main setting in the story takes place in Hogwarts. Harry goes on wild adventures.He fights off he-who-should-not-be-named. Then his godfather dies. Then he got told his life story.The main characters are Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Wesley. Also inThe book is Sirius Black. He gets killed. It's sad really.My opinion is that this is a good book. You would really like it."
2,Excellent Dictionary,"I found this dictionary outstanding quality. As a person who's english is not a first language, I love the unlimited variety words and the detailed descriptions of each words. I hoped if the book isn't so big and heavy but I guess it's impossible for this dictonary. I like to recommend to evrybody and I have so. For new buyers, you won't regret. People might think this dictionary is not much different from the oxford but THIS is quiet an extraordinary..."
1,For the Perfectionist,My fault here I am not a musican and I had no idea what to do with this once I got it? You need to have a be a teacher in music to use this.
1,Garbage,No need to review it properly because it is what it is...Trash. The singles of this album are the worst ever aside from her sisters own awful music. This is rock? This is music? For the tone deaf or just plain clueless.
1,Terrible!!! Did not even work!,"This was a gift for my son. He opened it and was excited, but that excited quickly turned to disappointment when the darn thing would not work. We tried everything, batteries, plugging it in the wall, and it still did not work. Dont waste your money.. Avoid this cheaply made product."
2,nifty little contraption,"This has more than enough room for all my earrings. I only put the ones I actually wear on this rack. The ones I don't wear I keep in a jewelry box. That way when I'm choosing outfits, I can easily view all of my earring options rather than searching through the jewelry box for something that matches."
2,Excellent Resource,This book is an excellent resource for therapists who wants to know more about psychotropics or for beginning prescribers. I am a final year nurse practitioner student and I find this book a wonderful book to have for review and reference.
2,Visually stunning!,This has been a family tradition for ages! The story is so sweet and the artwork so beautiful - but the music is ethereal. It stays with you throughout the holidays. This is no 'Frosty the Snowman' type movie - this Snowman is unforgettable!
1,Bloopers,"This tape is only for hardcore DS fans. No narrations involved to set up the bloopers. They didn't appear to have much of a budget, so when an actor blooped, they just kept on going. Some of the bloopers are really funny though. Like the tombstones in the graveyard. Every time someone brushed past them, they would wobble around. lol"
2,It was a gift to another person,"Based on the comments of the person to who the watch was given, she thinks very highly of it. It actually was given to her as replacement of a very nice dress watch that was stolen during the burglary of her home. She very much enjoys its features, i.e., illuminated dial, the larger more legible numbers on its dial, and it's smart yet practical style. I should mention that she has similar featured but more basic Timex that has served her well for many years with no problems. She had been wearing it daily for those many years.. The watch that was stolen was worn for those dressy occasions this Timex model she feels comfortable wearing whether daily and/or on those addition to those special occasions... Incidentally, she prefers leather bands."
2,Very important career advice,"Lester Korn, of the recruiting firm that bares his name, lays out career advice for people looking to get into senior positions.The book contains a very high level of intellectual honesty - how many headhunters would suggest NOT jobhunting is the best long term advice? Indeed - his suggestion that ""one big move"" is the best way to long term advancement is both counter-intuitive and against his own self interest.Definitely a great read that has survived the test of time. It would be interesting to read an updated version with modern data, but perhaps that is asking too much."
1,K-cup reusable coffee filter,"Terrible. Don't purchase! I purchased this as a gift for my husband. First, I received SIX reusable filters in one box. I must not have read the description. So, read the description. Second, we used one filter and there was coffee everywhere but in the cup. I am going to try to return them all."
2,"Fun stuff, easy to find what you need","I've been looking for information on Vice Presidents ever since we came *this* close to electing a former VP, but instead installed arguably one of the most powerful Vice Presidents in history with Dick Cheney. The facts in this book include many tidbits I have found on my own in reading Presidential biographies, but its nice to have them all in one place.It was also fun to read through the book as it is still unclear who Kerry will pick as a running mate, and to think about all of the different ways VPs have been selected in the history of our country.If you are at all interested in the personal politics of the U.S. government, this is a nice niche addition to your reading list!"
1,Do Not Buy,This coffee maker broke on the third use. The top that pushes down is very flimsy and a spoke broke making it unusable. Lucky for us we had another top from a different company that we had saved from an old pot that had broken.
1,The quality is poor,"I'm not a game-expert. What I want is just agile-response buttons. I got this item in late Sep. I played with it around 15 hours per week for two weeks. During Oct, I was busy with study and I almost didn't use it at all. Today, I found Key2 was non-responsive! I was very angry. I did no damage to it and the problem must lay in the quality! We should be compensated for this poor gamepad!"
2,It may have rasied $10m for the war effort but ..,"When I think Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No 1, I think Horowitz and Toscanini. Its simply unsurpassed. There are several recordings of Horowitz and Toscanini with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and for me the finest is the May 6th 1941 recording - a couple of years earlier than the performance on this CD.The quality of the CD is frankly terrible. If I can clean up the CD with little loss on my PC - albeit that I consider myself a professional - then surely RCA could have done better. Therefore the CD is disappointing on the one hand but still worthy of being added to your collection."
1,syfy failed with this movie,IF you think this is the one in theaters ITS NOT! you think it seems it had lots of action don't watch it. And it stared like in the middle of the movie WHAT KIND OF IDIOT WOULD DO THAT! So don't waste your money.
2,Most amazing game!,"If you like a game that requires thought and imagination, you need to try the Planescape campaign. The world is an interesting blend of steampunk & magic. The handbook covers all you need more, but I still wish it could be longer despite being complete in and of itself. It's just so fun to leaf through and drool over the amazing cool work. I'm not really into most gaming because of the emphasis on combat a lot of games have, but this particular setting allows for a wide variety of roleplaying. Just be sure to find a GM with a good imagination!"
1,not hardcover material,"This just isn't that good, and not worth shelling out the money for a hardcover. I liked the premise, and thought I was settling in for a Terry McMillan type of tale, since that is the hype they are going for with this. But, unfortunately, Terry has nothing to worry about! While her books pull you in and carry you along, this one just dragged. I just couldn't care about these characters, and she just goes on and on without getting to the point.Overall, a disappointment."
2,"Finally, a great hole punch","I have been using a terrible hole puncher at school for the past ten years. (hole guide shifting after every punch, a deluge of holes raining upon the classroom floor, fractured palms, etc.) After rejecting the new gold punch, I went on-line to find one that would work. Carl works. If you need some holes punched, I'm the guy to see. This punch smoothly and efficaciously handles 40 sheets - maybe more - with an ease that makes me teary-eyed. Buy it and eat the bill."
1,poor quality,"This rack is barely usable to hang mugs on. The pegs are wobbly and loose and the whole frame is flimsy. As I tried to hang it, the hanging loop bent and fell off. I would not trust any mugs to this rack! I also tried to hammer small brads into the end of the pegs to prevent the mugs from falling off (as I have done with other mug racks) and the pegs splintered and broke. Unless you want broken mugs, do not buy this rack!"
1,"Confusing, slow-moving and boring.","I get the impression that the makers couldn't decide between a role-playing game or a more traditional board game. Rather than be a simple, roll the dice, move your piece, do what the space you land on says, there can be any number of actions taken.While the characters are competing, they sometimes work together and at times you can move other players pieces to their disadvantage. You get to pick five cards but only play two per round, sometimes you roll one die -- sometimes all three, sometimes a round is over immediately if all three PP Girls get knocked out -- sometimes it drags on indefinitely. My four year old didn't get it, my 12 year old thought it was boring and we all gave up halfway through. Never again."
1,No mention as to the specific channel,So there's no mention of the specific channel this unit uses so I just happen to get two with the same channel which makes it kinda useless. Disappointing.
1,Tie Ropes too small,The ones available in local stores have longer tie ropes that extend to your belly. Its easy for tying. The ones that I ordered from Amazon have short ropes and its hard to put your hands behind your body and fumble with the knot. Its particularly hard for elderly persons who have Arthiritis ot Tentenitis.
1,Horrible Re-Dub of the original classic,"This product claims to be the original Appleseed, however, it contains a horrible re-dub of the original dubbed English track. The original was not filled with the ""F"" bomb in every other sentence. I got it because I enjoyed it on VHS when it came out, and wanted it on DVD, and I am very disappointed."
1,Not good if you need to widen your range,"If you are trying to use this lens for objects that you need to zoom in and zoom out on, don't buy it unless you are fast enough to take off the lens when the object is near you.. Why? Because your pictures will look like you have taken them in a tunnel...The zoom isn't that great anyway!"
1,A bummer...,"So I have attempted to switch as much as possible to environmentally friendly stuff. I like several Seventh Generation products, but the auto dishwasher gel is pretty bad. It leaves a strange film on my dishes, particularly those that are closest to the reservoir. I've found that if I mix a small dab of Cascade with this stuff, it's ok, but the goal was to get away from using Cascade and the like... and I bought an entire case of it. Darn! I will try the other environmentally friendly dishwasher detergents as soon as I finish this stuff (which will be in 2 years, at this rate). There's got to be a better product out there (or coming)."
2,Very helpful book!,"This book was extremely helpful during our trip to Bali! It was easy to understand, and had a lot of helpful extras that I haven't seen in other travel guides. Bali is SO unbelievably beautiful and wonderful...just wish I had had more time to visit all of the points of interest in the guide!"
2,"Good, but, not as good as I thought","As a member of ""Americas Test kitchen"", I bought this on their recommendation. It's a fine press, but does not hold the number of cloves, I was led to believe, it did. I actually like the ""Zyliss"" better. ""Test KItchen"" said the finish on the ""Zyliss"" would peel, but mine hasn't. Live and learn."
1,Would be great if I could watch it,"Never mentioned in the description that this was a PAL video from another region than the USA. An omission that means a lot. I was at this show, have seen clips, and was looking forward to seeing the entire thing now, 11 years later. Be forwarned - if you get this and live in America and do not own a multi-region player you will be out of luck."
2,Natural Horsemanship combined with romance,"With these two elements thrown together you have the foundation of a real pageturner! And this is what I found in this book - you simply can't put it down. The main character Tamara is a person with a great sense of humor and a down-to-earth attitude about life - just the kind of person you would love to be. Her male opponent Blake has suffered a lot of hard times and thus appears to be a very closed and agressive person at first. But things are not always what they seem to be.....I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because, especially to a horse person, there are lots of passages that make you laugh and think ""yes, this is exactly how it is!"". But there are also passages that leave you with a lump in your throat, and with a mixture like this you simply can't go wrong. If you love horses as well as romance novels this book belongs on your bookshelf and in your heart!"
2,Surprisingly Wonderful,"Chaka is giving us something different and this type of album is long overdue from her.I too wondered about the 2 Bond songs (any number of standards would have been a better fit for this album). In all, Chaka sounds great.To compare Chaka to Beyonce and Ashanti is a joke. They are vocalists in their own right but their careers have not even begun to touch Chaka's. Maybe in 20 years if they're still around..."
2,Max and Ruby,Love the show..cannot go wrong no matter what the age. Max is a riot!Where is their parents though?Peace out Max and Ruby!
1,Kind of Lame,Completely forgettable. Already forgotten. The only thing I can remember about it is the feeling of disappointment and disbelief that they would even call it Law and Order...
1,Dull,"You won't get an engrossing story. You won't get much action, either. There are some interesting points here and there, but overall I'd say it was a good cure for insomnia. The first half of this book, the first book of the new sun, is okay, and although the second half has some good moments, overall it is very dull. It reminded me of the second part of Don Quixote, which is to say I was extremely bored while reading it.Here is to hoping the second volume in this collection is better."
2,What a fun toy,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She was 2 and 3 months. She just loves it. It's a little messy since she has to have H20 but I just put a towel underneath, give her 1/2 a pot of water and let her go. It has taught her to pour without making a huge mess. Of course, she likes to try to drink out of the straw where the water comes out but that's no big deal. Education value is subjective and hard to rate. We have enjoyed it and purchased 2 others for gifts as well. Enjoy!"
1,disppointing,"The previous reviewer is, alas, right. A depressingly judgememntal book, far more interested in righteous pronouncement on predictable topics than in the exploration of art works far more complex than this author is willing to allow. The Pre-Raphaelites need new literature. Much of the writing now extant is stale and repetitive, but this is not the way forward. Look at the paintings, Dr Barringer - don't simply 'read' them for coded messages."
1,Save your Money and just download the Halabi design guide !!,"After reading this book i was very disapointed in the lack of technical information on the protocol. I was hoping for an indepth discussion on the packet formats and information on some of the less documented design issues with OSPF networks. If you are serious about learning this protocol then the RFC, Halabis guide, and Jeff Doyles Routing TCP/IP V1, are the only sources of information that hit the spot. To sum up : This book might have a place for mangement that would like a high level view of the protocol, but CCIE's or students studying towards CCIE will find this book very disapointing."
1,Don't let the picture decieve you,"From the picture and the fact that this set is more expensive than the average Corelle set, I was expecting a really nice set of dishes that I could have for years, since Corelle is so durable. Unfortunately, I hated the set so much that I returned them all. The print on the border is made with a dot-matrix printer, and if you don't know what that is, it's the old style of printers that prints everything in a series of dots. Even from a couple feet away, you can clearly tell that the set is made this way and is very pixelated. Not only that, but when you rub your hand over the print, it's like rubbing your hand over a piece of paper. The plate itself is smooth and feels like glass, then when you touch the border it's really rough and not what I expected. Unfortunately, you won't find anything that's better unless you spend more, but this set still isn't worth the price."
1,Don't be fooled,"Do not buy this product. The description implies that the clipper attachment is metal and is somehow ""professional"" in quality, but in fact, it is mostly made of cheap plastic with a cheap aluminum clip. The teeth are sharp and not rounded and the overall quality is lower than the standard plastic attachments. I would send it back if the shipping didn't cost more than the product."
2,A GOOD BOOK CONCERNING THE ISSUES OF BIOTERRORISM,"Robin Cook's thrilling novel about skinhead bioterrorists is a must read! A vengeful Russian cabbie has teamed up with racist bioterrorists to unleash anthrax in New York City. It's up to medical examiner Jack Stapleton to save the day! Get ready for one of the most suprising book endings ever! Also, this book also demonstrates the real issue of bioterrorism.{Don't worry. Nothing in the book will probably not happen.} Well, anyways, read Vector, it's Robin Cook's best!"
1,I was expecting better from Mark Wahlberg,Should have talked to my friend before viewing - it wasn't that great. There were funny parts but overall a flop.
1,Don't ever purchase from this place.,"I bought this early December of 2006, hoping it will arrive in time for my daughter's birthday on the Dec. 28th. Weeks and months later... it never delivered. It's 02/08/07 and I decided to have them refund my money. I don't understand why they ask if I want a refund or a reship when they turn around and tell me that it's out of stock. I think it was NEVER in stock to begin with. DON'T buy from them EVER."
1,be careful who you buy from,I had this same baby swing a few years ago. I wanted a new one for my new grandchild. I was excited to find it on line. It was shipped to me without parts. I'm still waiting!!!!! Not Happy
2,A compass for wireless business and investment,"A thouroughly researched, detailed book on what direction wireless and ubiquitous computing are going in. There may be those who shake their heads at how much these new sensors/appliances/gadgets will influence our lives, but the book lays out the data and trends methodically. This is must reading for any manager of a high-tech company or anyone investing in same. The book is highly unusual in its level of illustration, examples and background data -- many other books on future technology, in contrast, offer only oceans of opinionated verbiage with little to back it up. Any reader alert to opportunity should get a very high ROI out of buying this book."
1,Hawking is useless,"Can access the Hawking HWREG1 Wireless G Range Extender very well from 3 laptops and a PS3. On the otherhand, it does not allow internet access. Therefore, it is a brick that serves no purpose (Might could use it for a doorstop). It extended the range of what could not be done already. Called support, they had no clue of what to do. Therefore, I cannot recommend this product. It does not work and tech support is non-existent. Rather, I would suggest staying away from it. It is the first product that I have bought that was completely useless."
1,I feel stupid for buying this book,I have not yet read the whole book and I already cant stand it. As I read it all I can think is Wow this author is very conceited. The way she talks about herself is soooooo narcissistic. I have seen pictures of her and I think its weird that she looks like she has had so much plastic surgery done. How is this someone that is at peace with themselves? I dont get it. I wish I could get my money back.
2,Ellen is a power fusion goddess!,"I am a clumsy person and never liked workout videos until I found Ellen's ""Bikini Ready Fast"", but this video may even be better! Great energizing and lengthening moves that are challenging while still being very elegant, with seamless transitions to the next move. Great job Ellen!"
1,A vastly better series than pokemon.,Great a pokemon clone. Which sadly spawned another wave of mon titles.
2,Convenient,"It keeps my windshield clear during the rain, sometimes even not need using the blades. The only thing I don't like is it seems wiper contents too much fluid, and quite difficult to get them applied evenly on the wondshield. Leaves messy traces, sometimes even not able to see through the windshield clearly. (esp. at night)"
1,Subpar at best...,"This album was most certianly less than spectacular, boring, repetative, melancholy, there were only two tracks that I cared to hear more than once(#3&7), and those were nothing too special. Even girls I let listen to it didn't like it, and with this genre of music if that's true then there's no reason to waste your time or money on it. Thank god I didn't buy it cause it really would have turned me off of DCFC's music which I have really grown fond of. This album just doesn't deserve much praise and I don't entend on giving it..."
2,Simply works,"This item is a little more expensive then Walmart, but i will pay and extra $2 any day to avoid waiting in a line at a Walmart."
2,Finally! Fantasy for grownups.,"Lynn Abbey is a well-established fantasy novelist best known for some pretty gritty fair -- Thieves World, Forgotten Realms, Magic, and the like. This is a book much closer to her -- a middle-aged, unassuming, well-educated woman from Ann Arbor, Michigan who just happens to travel through time fixing things. Her figure isn't perfect, her breasts aren't perky, she doesn't look fabulous in a leather bikini. Instead, she has a job, a house, civic commitments, dysfunctional family issues -- oh, and this whole time traveling thing. This is fantasy that I can relate to."
2,"into medialis they do go, yes",there were corollary tendency. without sshining light the new generation do you? uh?
1,I ordered this twice and both times disc would not play,I still have not seen this movie and was excited to see it. There must have been a batch of faulty/blank discs. I finally gave up.
1,This is the keep case version,I specifically ordered the version that did not say it was the keep case package (there were separate listings) because I hate that type of case. It is flimsy and easily damaged in general. But I got the keep case anyway. I am very disappointed. Amazon often pulls this bait and switch type of description.
2,Thanks to her! I'm loving football,I love it. It's funny but yet serious. I was able to enjoy myself reading the book. NOthing boring. Everything is in detail.
1,Disappointed,"This was my first Barbara Delinsky book. I thought the premise was interesting, however, I thought Barbara had a problem writing from a ""male perspective."" The first 50 pages were good but the story became more unbelievable and predictable as it went on. I must admit I was even more diappointed because of the glowing reviews."
2,Herbert Campbell,"I found this recording very interesting. I initially bought it for the Herbert Campbell track to complete my collection of his catalogue of 4 songs. Of course, as these thing do, I was introduced to many of the artists of that era.The original reason for wanting the Herbert Campbell recordings was that he was a great friend of my Great grandfather Whimsical Walker, also known as Jamie Darling, see DVD David Copperfield (1913). As I'm in the throws of rewriting his autobiography 'From Sawdust to Windsor Castle' I thought this recording would inspire me, Which of course it did.As an introduction to popular (pop) music of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era, I'd recommend this album highly. I'd also recommend 'A Night at the Music Hall' this contains 2 of Herbert Campbell's other songs. This four disc album can also be purchased at Amazon"
1,Stay with XP,"I'm not a tech guy. But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance. About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement. But there is nothing there. Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell. Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.Save your money. Don't buy it."
1,don't buy this product !,"turbo tax double bills...is almost impossible to call...if you crash or want to use 2 computers,you are out of luckcustomer service is arrogant and unhelpfuland virtually impossible to talk toafter over 10 years of using this product,I am ready to look for something else next year"
2,"Political, personal, and beautiful","Richard blends a wonderful selection of material, from the anti-war songs ""Fenario"" and ""Waist Deep"" to the beautiful 9/11 inspired ""Last Fare"". ""Hazel's House"" seems a bit overly sentimental at first, until you admit that every family has a traditional holiday gathering place that is a bit of heaven on earth (For my family it was Madeline's Apartment, but that would be tougher to phrase in a song :-)) ""Che Guevara T-Shirt"" is part love song, part political drama, following the poorly planned attempt by a stowaway to make it to Miami (a prequel to ""Fishing""?).The production is more subdued than prior studio albums...without Larry Campbell there are fewer instrumental flourishes giving the album a more personal ""acoustic"" feel than ""Somewhere Near Patterson"" and ""Reunion Hill"". Hopefully Richard won't make us wait another four years for his next album."
2,Great tool for keeping organised.,After years of having keys thrown every which way in a box and taking long times to find we finally bought this key cabinet. Now we can find the keys immediately without searching. Love it!
2,Great deal,This thing works well. I have WIN-7 pro and no problems... it is a big heavy ball. I got it on sale so I could not pass. Just need a mic for podcast type stuff and a local radio program. all voice data. I would buy again. sure you could buy better but it would cost more. This was about 40% of the cost of the next mic I was considering. all in all I am happy and saved about $60 buck. great deal in usb mic's.
1,Patronizing,It's a testimonial to how effective leftist indoctrination is in popular culture that this political hack S.T. Joshi who has authored such history books as From Thomas Jefferson to David Duke should apparently be the dominate current editor of H.P. Lovecraft's writings.Many of the books which Joshi has edited actually carries warnings of the quaint antique datedness of the contents to be read with the condescending superiority that an assumed left/liberal urban professorate can bestow on reactionary trifles.This dichotomy between an academic's doctrinaire loyalties and marketing results in Joshi's schizophrenic editing. A finicky apologetic mess.Joshi is symptomatic of the congealing imagination as the ivy league disgorges it's post-modern generation into publishing. Lovecraft and company deserve better.
1,The Shelters of Stone,My teenage daughter and I both enjoyed reading this series. This book in particular was full of interesting insight as to how people may have lived and communicated pre-ice age. Very well written and enjoyable to read. Caution -- not for younger readers due to sexual content.
2,A lot for little.,"Nicely padded, room for a couple filters and extra film. Compact and great for carrying. Caution! Leave it zipped, because if you pick up this bag opened your camera will fall out."
1,Did not use,"This product was next to useless for me. Even with proper cutting and fitting, it never fit right. also, there was a excess material point on the top of the head and overall was translucent so hair showed through. I threw it out and made a different costume. Definitely spend more money for a better one."
1,WHY IS THERE NO 0 STARS??!!,"THIS BOOK WAS SO OFFENSIVE AND HORRIBEL IT MADE ME SICK. I AM A YOUNG WICCAN AND ALTHOUGH MY PARENTS ARE NOT, THEY UNDERSTAND AND ARE SUPPORTIVE OF MY OWN RELIGION. YES, LETS LIE TO PEOPLE SOME MORE ABOUT WITCHES......"
2,Great deal!,"These bars go for $1.50 or more in stores, and I used to buy out the stock whenever they went on sale for a dollar each. Now I find I can buy them for about that much anytime I want on Amazon! They arrive very quickly, nice and fresh. The cookies 'n' cream flavor is my favorite and I never seem to tire of it. Also recommend the nutty butter crisp. Both of them are tasty and not at all icky as some nutrition bars can be. The bars are also good and filling; if I eat one on a totally empty stomach it'll be about three hours before I'm hungry again. I've reordered them many times. Long live Amazon."
2,"Good, but twitchy","This is probably one of the better dance mix CD's out there, but I always find reason to question the choice of songs on these CDs. The remixes of ""Love Fool"" and ""How Bizarre"" are great but I question putting ""Da Dip"" in the middle of those. Many of these other tracks great but I don't like the ""Don't Speak"" remake."
1,"Terrible -- Buy ""The Complete Calligraphy Set"" instead","This set is just terrible. The box has the lie that this set includes everything you need. In fact, it contains no calligraphy ink, and the ink that is in the box is packaged in fountain pen cartridges. That there is no fountain pen in the bos makes this fact is bizare. Moreover, the text book is useless.BUY READER'S DIGEST'S ""THE COMPLETE CALLIGRAPHY SET"" INSTEAD. It is an excellent work, does have everything you need, and has much more information in the text book."
1,Worst CD To Nap To. Ever.,"I mean, come on, how on earth are we supposed to get a good classical music nap with all this ruckus? And what's with the cover? How deaf is that old man that he can't hear all that noise going on? Crash, Boom Boom, Whap, Sproing, Wonk. For pity's sake. Give us a few bars we can snooze through, please? That opening bassoon in the super high register is a nice start, almost a tease, but after that, you're on your own. No rest here.Robert Lewis"
2,Great music!,"This music is the best! The very best part of movie, in fact, is the music. I love all the songs!"
2,works good,"It was easy to setup. But it needs some time to familiarize with router menus. Once you get a handle, it works like a charm for you.I really saw the difference in my internet browsing after installing this router. And never went out of wireless range.Good buy."
2,Good Ol' Simpson....They Just Keep Coming,"After eight seasons, I'm thinking maybe the Simpsons should perhaps come up with a new character, or a new storyline to add a bit of spark....honestly, I slept through most of the first DVD in this set. That's unusual for me, because I am a true lover of this animated series. Condition of item when received was perfect and quickly shipped. If you love the simpsons, don't pass this up.."
1,Yuck.,"I got this disc ...the cover art looked cool so I opened it and pressed play.Yuck.Head Shrinkin Fun is a very mediocre recording by a very mediocre surf-punk band. Now don't get me wrong, the musicians sound accomplished in this style of music..and they do it somewhat well. But after hearing things like Dick Dale, or even The Ventures, this is weak in comparison. It seems as though all the songs sound the same to me. I just don't find much worth to this CD.2 stars for being rather dull, repetitive, and not as good as others in the genre."
1,very confusing,"Carol Vorderman calls herself a master, but i dont think so. She only started sudoku in 2005, not even a year. The way she explains her methods in the book are confusing. There are much easier ways to find out the answers. Any logical person would know that there are easier ways to find answers than how she says how to find the answers. Her methods take a long time. The methods are correct, but it just makes the player (person doing sudoku) take longer to do the puzzles. I did one of the puzzles that are ""super-difficult"" in her book without using any of her advice and I was able to do it in 10 minutes comfortably. You don't need her hints to do sudoku puzzles. You should buy a book that has pure sudoku puzzles in it."
1,Oh my word,"Wow...That's all I can say. I haven't laughed this hard in a very long time. As a ""card carrying grobanite"" At first I was appalled by the idea, and then when I listened to the samples I honestly just LAUGHED!!! and laughed VERY HARD! Maybe these guys would be good if it wasn't Josh Groban's music, but probably not. The voice QUALITY isn't as good as the orriginal.... My advice, buy the real thing. Josh is currently alive, well, getting grounded, on tour and only 23. My question to you is why waste your money if you can get the real thing? (Especially if the tribute would make Josh flip in the grave, if he was dead)"
1,Much cheaper elsewhere,"Color is not as shown, price is double of where you can find elsewhere for RIO chair based in Philly. Vendor makes returns difficult."
2,excellent printer!,This is a great little printer. I travel frequently and have to take my office with me. It has excellent print quality for photos and documents. I was also impressed with how much printing you get out of the small print cartriges. Overall great product.
2,Wish I had two,I ordered this combo and only received the Back Buddy. The Mini was nowhere to be found. I contacted Amazon and they return half the cost. I was happy with that because the Back Buddy alone would have cost about $10 more. I save money.\I use it for trigger points in my back and shoulder. It works well.It is also a nice conversation starter when people come in my office wondering what this gadget is.I generally keep it in the trunk of my car so I have access to it at home too. Wish I had another.
2,Even more scary after 9-11,How could we allow air rage to continue as it did before 9-11? Someone on the Independent Commission investigating 9-11 should read this book. That is the real outrage!!!
1,Skip it,This CD is not by far as good as I thought it would be. Nearly every song sounds the same. Do yourself a favor and save some money and just buy individual songs.
1,eh,"Puddle of Mudd really does sound like everyone else out there, which really is disappointing!! I thought She Hates Me was fun...and Psycho too...but then the rest of the clips could all just be the same song, ya know?? It's getting old, boys..."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"The product, CATCH STICK-UMS, that they sent was not even made by Spaulding as advertised but rather Halex, a cheaper brand. Second, one of the rims for the mitts completely came off even before usage, and lastly, the ball's lining is deattaching from the ball itself. I am very disappointed in this company and product. Never will I buy from them again."
2,An Enjoyable Read,"Patterson does a pretty good job with his latest installment in the Women's Murder Club series. The story was intriguing, page turning and sad at times. Especially when the girls loose one of their own. This book is definitely my type of police procedural. Looking forward to what comes next in this series."
2,Loved it.,"I was home sick in bed and watched the entire thing. It was excellent. The acting was wonderful, costumes, set design everything was excellent. If you like Dickens you will love this. I highly recommend it."
2,Great book,"Great book, highly recommended. Can be even used as a text book. You should have this one, if you are a undergraduate EE student."
2,Jimpster - Domestic Science,"A radical departure for Jamie Odell (a.k.a. Jimpster), DOMESTIC SCIENCE takes more from his more dance-oriented Audiomontage moniker. That's not to say that this album is no good; on the contrary, it shares much with other dance-jazz masters such as Atjazz. ""Deep Down,"" for instance, is as deep as it can and should get, while ""State of Mind"" is a nice downtempo funker. ""Fish Island"" is deep house that suddenly ends with a jazzy outro, while ""Knuckle Shuffle"" goes for a more tech feel. ""Groove Jumping"" is wickedly fun funk, with a vocal sample that you just can't give up; ""37,000 ft"" continues that vibe. ""B:Mine,"" however, takes things down a notch with a slowburning lullaby. ""Pixel Grain"" has a tinkling urgency, while the final track, ""Fluorescent Blue"" has a questionable vocal. Overall, though, it's a step in a new direction, one that Odell handles with grace and, as always, superior musicianship."
1,Young rehashing Young,"Politics aside, most of the songs on here are not very original. As I listened to it, it seemed to me that Young was rehashing or recycling some of his earlier songs and licks. I think the only reason this CD got the press it did was because of the politics of the lyrics and Young flip-flopping on his earlier support of the war on terror (just like most of the Democrats). This is only for hardcore Young fans."
2,Romancing God,"I have a habit of being able to generally read books of the same genre/subject back to back but I never tire of well written books about chasing God. It's the ultimate romance. Here, a Reform Jewish girl turns Orthodox Jew turns Episcopalian. It is a complex book about love and devotion for God, chasing God in a Judeo Christian courtship setting written by an ordinary desperate, unashamed seeker, a broken sinner and an intelligent, intellectual young woman.I have also always had a mild fascination with Judaism and this flowered my fascination into love. I loved how every single word in her book is chosen wisely and beautifully and was sad when this love story book ended and I can almost say with certainty she will end up Catholic someday. I look forward to that day.In addition, there is also a helpful study guide at the back of this book for those inclined to book clubs or for similar group study."
2,Hat Tricks Count - Hockey,Just love the book - it was a gift from a Hockey Fan to a child - goes great with the hockey alphabet book.Pictures are wonderful along with all the hockey information.
1,In remembrence of Billy,"I bought this book for my special friend Billy a couples of months ago, and although he was is the terminal stage of his battle against aids (aids won) hie enjoyed it thouroughly. Recomended to all gays like Billy."
1,A Big Let Down,"6 February 2003I just finished reading ""The Christmas Train"" and I must say that this novel was a huge disappointment - it lacked everything that we readers have been expecting from a Baldacci Novel. Raw energy, fizz, suspense, intricate plotting and deft characterisation. I am one of his ardent admirers and therefore the disappointment is more acute. This novel must rank as a dud amongst his novels so far.Hope his coming novel shall prove that ""The Christmas Train"" was an aberration. Intelligent writers like Mr.Baldacci are far and few in between.Please don't disappoint the readers again.Regards:R.S.Bivalkar"
2,Great for the mind and the spirit,"I am fascinated by this CD, plus I really enjoy it. The mathematical puzzles it poses are fascinating. I've found myself trying to design guitar and piano keyboards with some of the more interesting tone sets (15, 19) and wondering about different ways of writing music. I'd love to see Mr. Blackwood's notebooks on musical notations.In addition, this is a lot of fun to listen to. Mr. Blackwoods compositions are sometimes a little basic, but I think he intended them that way in order to let the beauty and strangeness of these new modes just wash over us in their glory. He does a great job of tying the style of the composition to the tones that a given mode best expresses. Bravo!"
1,most terrible garbage ive ever heard,wow this is a terrible album and a terrible bandSLIPKNOT RULES!
1,Too much money for too little performance,"Lasted about 5 months. Way too heavy a lens that's wrapped in plastic that breaks easy. Too fragile. Just a slight bump is enough to fracture the internal plastic holdings rendering it non-useable and a couple hundred dollar repair bill. Strongly, strongly recommend that if there's any opportunity that you may be a bit rough, you go to a cheaper lens. I am a 30 yr semi-pro Nikon user. Cost not worth the life of the lens."
1,not motorola oem,This was bought from BTO. It's not Motorola as described. There is a lot of static noise which pretty much renders it unusable. It's a waste of money.
1,An expensive disappointment,"Lack of grammar forms, laconic definitions, and flat-out errors mar this much-touted ""first Russian dictionary for Americans."" The Defense Language Institute does a disservice in handing this out to military linguists... and leaving their supervisors and senior linguists to pick up the pieces down the line. Don't waste your money - hie thee to an Oxford!"
2,Literary Spirituality,"This is a story of love and hate, hope and despair, faith and non-belief. As one man attempts to uncover the sanctity of another man, he discovers his own humanity. Rev. Blaise Meredith is sent by the Vatican to begin a process of investigation. Was Giacomo Nerone a saint and martyr or merely a military deserter who had only the appearance of sanctity? As Morris West delves into the story of Nerone and those who loved and hated him, he brings to light the universal questions about who we are, what is our purpose in life, and what is our ultimate destination. This is a beautifully written story which evokes personal reflection and spiritual contemplation. Ultimately, this is a story of love, hope, and faith."
1,Soooooo disappointed,"I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line."
2,Perfect for Parents and Grandparents,"We love curling up with our newly reading grandsons (no grand daughters yet) and sharing the reading with them.A terrific concept and implementation, and lots of fun for all of us."
1,Dull Writing,"I never thought a such a beloved subject could be framed in an intellectually boring way. Well, thats what Telotte's done here with his book, ""Science Fiction Film."" The book reads more like an essay on Faulkner, rather than an essay on exploding planets and alien abductions. I simply can't recommend anyone read this book, but if you were unfortunate enough to have and enrolled in a class where it is required reading, all I can say is good luck."
2,A Healthier choice,"If you are concerned with the re-usability of plastic water bottles and are unsure what to buy, then this product is for you. If, like me, you are concerned with the durability of just about any item; this product is for you. The only reason it doesn't have a five-star rating is because it is not dishwasher safe and it is suggested that putting the Klean Kanteen in a refrigerator is a bad idea. Fill it up twice and you have your daily dose of H20."
1,Disappointed,"I have been using Cross product for lat 15 years. This product which is Made in China, has highly disappointed me. The finish of the pen is very poor. Gold plating is of a poor quality. It has some patches of a different color. The body has sharp edges.Overall it has spoilt my impression about Cross products.RegardsR.P. Kale"
2,Peoples of the south wind,"An awsome album from the people of the south wind. Buy this and all their music, you will not be disapointed at all. believe me these guys are of the highest caliber. I live in northeast Kansas their own stomping ground and have seen these guys live several times and they are always great. Always."
2,"Good Product, Easy to use",Product was easy to use to assemble.Product supported my weight (180 lb) and was easy to take down. I usually do not have time to work out and this product is great for quick pull up workout.Did notice some scuff marks around the door frame but no damage otherwise.
1,works great for 2 months,you think this product is great cuz of the 4 stars. dont fall into the trap like i did. i bought it thinking well its cheap and lotsa ppl like it. its been 2 months since i got it and the right ear bud just stopped working. if i move the wire around theres static. dont waste ur dough. get something >$30
2,A Kingly Text,"I really enjoy this text. I would never normally buy a textbook like this, but I had to for a class. The text is easy to read, interesting, and very informative. It is a great addition to any medieval nerd's library."
1,You get what you pay for...,"After reading the numerous reviews of this shower head, I decided to give it a try.. It arrived in a plain white box and after opening it, I discovered that the head itself is nothing more than a tin can with holes poked in it.. The extension that it came with was of decent quality but that didn't stop it from leaking.. I installed the item, against my better judgement, and after turning on the water, I almost died laughing.. I always believed that you get what you pay for but after seeing all the positive reviews, I had to give it a try.. That mistake will not happen again.. Happy shopping.."
2,"God's love, it's an awesome thing","Wow, what a wonderful book. Kendra has put into words, what love is and how love works. Not only does she allow us to learn about wordly love, but she has given us the advantage of knowing about the greatest love of all, God's love. If you have no idea has to how God's love works, this is the book for you."
2,Best Blues Vocalist,"This is the best blues vocalist ever, and the 2nd disc with its more laid back atttiude is better. Excellent sound, excllent band."
1,Pricey Plastic,overpriced and very cheap looking. It's plastic and its not oil rubbed bronze.Dont waste your money!
1,a waste of money,horrible book... i got a 5 exam because i threw this book away and got the 5 Steps To A 5 one. that one was MUCH better than anything in this one. most of the material in this book was not on the test
1,Terrible - Known problems,"This has a known problem if your system is Windows XP. It may work for one day and then stop working. Will get an error that says 'Device cannot start. Code 10'. Belkin will replace it without asking very many questions. If I could give this zero stars, that's what I would give it. Don't buy this."
2,Expose on the New Age-UN-New World Order Connection,"Having been into New Age before becoming a Christian, I could identify with their utopian belief systems. It was eerie reading the quotes from New Age literature in Mr. Kah's book; what I once accepted as 'spiritual truth' now made me sick to my stomach. In addition, the experience of reading the book exposed the remnants of New Age thought still lurking in my psyche.I've been following the New Age-United Nations-New World Order connection in conjunction with 'End Time' Biblical Prophecy for a couple years. Mr. Kah's book is an excellent study on the interconnections among these movements. I would recommend it highly to anyone with similar interests.In addition, this book is a 'must-read' for Christians because New Age and Interfaith ideologies are beginning to influence Christian thought. Understanding the root belief systems behind these ideologies is critical to spiritual discernment."
2,"Honey, I have to go the west coast with an old man.","Some of the reviewers have missed the point. This is a book about THE BRAIN, but also about age, life, dreams, and continuity. It's a neat little book that says more than it says. and means more than it says. A great gift, and a thought provoking ride across a country and time."
1,This book is hard to keep you interested in.,I would not recommend this book to anyone especially to an experienced reader.
2,My husband loves it!,"I bought this as a follow up gift to the handheld Garmin GPS I got my husband for Christmas several years ago. Before I got the City Navigator he only had the topographical maps (the original intent of this gift was for him to use while hiking and hunting). But he started to use it in the car more and more and mentioned several times that he wanted City Streets as well. We do not have the traditional dash mounted GPS, but in a pinch this is great!"
2,How can this be out of stock!,How can you buy this movie when its out of stock? You can. Buy a used video or dvd (if it's on dvd). It is the banannas inm Pajams birthday comming up and thier next friends the Teddys plan a suprised birthday party for the banananas in pajams. But soon the bannans decide to have a birthday party without knowing the Teddyies has decide it first.
2,I can't believe how amazing this book is.,I am/was your classic doormat kind of girl and I realized that I just might be doing something wrong. One day I was discussing this with my friends and she recommended this book. In the first 10 pages I learned what exactly I was doing wrong. I recommend this book for every woman who feels like she needs to change herself for the better and no longer wants to be a doormat.
2,This isn't a tool album. Not even close.,"While the singer remains the same, this isn't a Tool album at all. Tool is a heavy, heavy angst driven band. The songs on this album are melodic but, not flowery. Maynard gets to show off his intensity, but, in a different light. Tools tends to play songs that are reactions to situations, while Perfect Circle is more about the situation itself. Desires and feeling that drive the situation. Being a big fan of Tool, it's great to see Maynard explore his music with a different voice."
1,This sucks!,"This video totally sucks. The host is one of the most obnoxious people I have ever had to tolerate. You learn a couple of things, but its not worth it having to sit thru his blaringly obnoxious personality.As a side note, he must be gay or something, because not only does he go to the transvestite carnival, but he also goes to some sort of transvestite after party. Still, even if you are gay, this is not the film to learn about brazil. All movies by this globe trekker company suck big time."
2,Special Book,"Everyone should have two copies of this book. One for when you have a loss and one to give to a friend when they have a need. I have personally given away at least 10 copies over the years.When I suffer a loss, even small ones, I take a bubble bath and read, ""How to survive the Loss of a Love""."
2,Kevin Smith does it again,Kevin Smith has a wonderful and twisted brain. He uses his amazing ability to turn things on their head making you think about them as view them from the skewed angle. Dogma pushes the buttons of organized religion while giving the agnostics something to contemplate. This is a trip worth repeating.
1,HORRIBLE,"I wouldn't even give this book a star if I had the option. The fact is, not only is this book harldy helpful, but it is also obvious upon reading this book that the author must be an uptight, jewish princess who obviously only enjoys Santa Fe and Taos merely because it is the ""in"" thing for snobs to do. She tries to be informative, but is really just dumb. And her picture is god-awful, I feel so terribly sorry for anyone who has ever had to see her in person, let alone date or sleep with her. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THIS NO TALENT CREATIVE WRITING WANNABE YOUR MONEY"
2,Surprisingly addictive,"I thought Chocobo's Dungeon 2 was going to be a medicore effort from the makers of SquareSoft. Of course, things took a change, and I started to love this game. This game is basically set upon dungeons, which are incredibly tedious at first, but once you know how to use magic, feathers, and other such things, you'll grow on it. The only bad part is that it can be annoying when you keep dying. Oh well, 'cause this is a GREAT effort, and worth any money."
1,Poor effort,This book was horrible. It became work just to finish it. A very disappointing effort from an author that is capable of better work.
1,Hokey Pokey Elmo Hokey!,"Elmo does NOT sing the whole song. In fact all he does is put his left arm in and his right leg. When he ""shakes it all about"" it's all noise...... no shaking. He is not soft and cuddly either. I am very disappointed. Then again, my grandson loves ANYTHING loud!"
2,works grate,"works grate, truck starts every time now. if you have something you don't start very often this is the way to go."
2,Works Well But Could Be Better,"We bought this to bring with us on vacation. Our five year old was the one using it. It folds up and fits well in our car. Has a bag to pack it in, but there's no way to tie it closed. It came with a matching blue sheet which helps keep the actual cot clean. No putting together necessary, no buttons to make it close/open. Quick set up. My only complaint was the middle has an uncomfortable support. When we went on vacation, our 5 year old complained that it bothered her. The next night she used it, I put some more padding down in between her and the cot. Other than the support and no way to keep the bag closed, it was great."
1,Disappointing,"One needs to bring some critical thinking to work as to what one buys and reads. I fully agree with reader Guido. Images are blurred, of extremely poor quality and not truly informative. There is only a small number of examples offered in the book (as if this were an attempt to bring about a touch of reality to a text that would otherwise be even dryer and engineering-oriented). The limited range of materials and processes is not representative of the industrial design practice. Besides, conceptual categories which were employed to organize the book seemed to me quite confusing and not logically classified. The author does show knowledge of the subject. However, his approach is not particularly didactical and complete--and therefore not as useful as it could be. I don't feel this is the right text and the right form for industrial designers. The book, in my opinion, does not live up to the promise of its title and price."
2,Nice,"Ester, Helen, Lula-Mae, Rockelle, and Rosalie have one problem: Clyde Brooks. All of these working class woman no matter how smart, sophisticated, and witty have issues with men, and they just can't stop making crazy decisions. I won't delve into all of them but I will confess that Ms. Monroe covers woman in four different shades and all woman may find themselves in all or one of these ladies. The novel had some very vivid visuals that Monroe really painted to perfection. Just something as simple as Lula-Mae's pregnant belly hanging off the bed was spelled out in a unique way. I loved the writing. I definitely recommend this novel to woman looking to learn something about themselves and men looking to learn about the psyche of a woman.Read in iBooks. Review by Rahiem Brooks, author of MURDER IN GERMANTOWN."
1,interesting plot but bad details,This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again.
1,"Poor writing, confusing story","This book looked like it may have been interesting. The description on the dust jacket sounded promising. In reality, neither was true. the story starts out slow and mixed with emotion, and ends up slower, confusing, and flat out boring. If ever I had to force myself to read a book, this was it. The more detail the author tried to put into the novel, the more I wanted to scream, because how can you add detail to a story that is barely readable in the first place? Definitely on my DO NOT READ list."
2,A winner for all levels of birders,"This beautifully written book will appeal to all levels of birders, from novices to experts. It is a great introduction to the lives of songbirds (and would make a wonderful gift for someone you hope to interest in birds), and it also includes some historical background and news of the latest research that dedicated birders will find interesting. That's a difficult balance to achieve, but Chu has done it magnificently. Especially useful (for all levels of birders) is the copious concrete information about things we can do to improve the lives of songbirds and projects in which we can help. My Christmas shopping got a lot easier when I read this book."
1,Heavy Sledding and a Misleading Title,"I started this book with high hopes found this to be a rambling and self-absorbed polemic. I'm not sure that the title accurately represents the gist of the book, which seems to be a one-sided debate with the scientific world view. Smith constantly tells us where he is going, what he is doing next -- like the reader is interested in the mechanics of how he constructs his argument. At the end, I felt a victim of ""bait and switch,"" expecting further thought on the importance of religion in our life as opposed to an intellectual artillery barange on the modern scientific approach. This was a disappointment and I felt somewhat mis-led."
1,Mission to Mars crashes.,"I rated this movie two stars only for the impressive special effects. On a whole, it was quite lame. For example, one could certainly ""feel"" Connie Nielsen's grief as Tim Robbins drifted away, and eventually hastening his own death, but did she shed even one tear, not that I saw. Not very convincing. And the premise that aliens seeded humankind was downright laughable. Glad I spent only $3.00 for a rental. Gee, I wonder what good ol' Star Trek rerun I should have watched instead."
2,my favorite,"i've purchased all of her albums and i enjoy all of them, but this one is my favorite. this is one you can listen to when you just want to zone everything else out and listen to great music."
2,One of the Best Dracula Movies,"Bram Stoker's DraculaI tried for years to get a copy of this fine movie on DVD and, finally, Amazon has it! The younger Frank Langella does a fine job of making the monster both suave, sophisticated, and seductive while also being very creepy and scary. This particular movie leaves out the portion of the original novel which takes place in Transylvania and starts with the shipwreck in Britain. It is well-paced. I also like how they don't get carried away with the special effects. Dracula does not morph into monstrous creatures nor are there buckets of blood. The creepy effects are created by fine acting, direction, and cinematography.I didn't give this a 5 as I don't believe the definitive Dracula movie has been produced yet. Cross this with the Gary Oldman version minus the graphic sexuality and overwhelming special effects (which extensively portrays the Transylvania portion of the novel and also has a fine actor in the title role) and you'd have the perfect movie."
1,tick TOCK,Length:: 0:25 MinsRealy LOUD ticking for a quiet office. I've taken 30 secs of video and will try uploading it when I am near a cable.
1,"Cute idea, terrible quality","Amazon did a great job with shipping and packaging, so this review is in no way meant to be critical of them, just the product. The characters are adorable, and the story of the Nutcracker is told in a unique way (though there are some scary parts, even for my 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 year olds, which probably could have been portrayed in a bit different way). Sadly, the quality of the visual experience is absolutely terrible. Grainy, sometimes disjointed; pretty bad animation to begin with, but even that may be forgiven were it clear and sharp. Neither is true, unfortunately. Would not recommend."
1,Spend a little more on something else,"Blanket is not comfy, very thin and stiff. Ordered a King for a Queen sized bed and it just barely fits."
2,BestAir LASKO Replacement Humidifier Filter,"These replacement filters work very well with our LASKO 1128 humidifier. With our water (which isn't especially hard) we can easily get a couple of months of use out of a single filter, and that's with the humidifier running pretty much 24 hours a day."
2,Cheers for 165,"Didn't see much of original series but this one is a great view of British aristocracy in the 30's. Beautiful to look at, beautifully acted. I wish it would go on and on."
1,DVD quality sucks,"I bought this for my dad for Fathers Day, and he was really excited to start watching them. He said the quality was so bad, he couldn't even finish the movie he was watching. He said it was like a bad copy from VHS to DVD. I will be returning this."
2,"Large, upscale watch.","Very nice watch, large face and case. My wrist is on the thin side but was able to size the band and it looks good. Have several Seiko watches and very pleased with the quality and this watch is no different; bullet-proof! I would consider this an upscale watch as it has high visual appeal, cool features, and several elements of interest. IMO not a daily watch as it is rather bulky. Highly recommend as a second or third watch for certain occasions."
1,Worst Rodney film EVER!!!!,"I think the title says it all here, I could be the biggest fan of Rodney there is and I couldnt stomach this film. Gouge your eyes out before you watch it!!!"
1,Cant handle the everyday use,"This product cannot handle everyday use, I have had it less then a year and the motor burnt up. I can only exchange it at Kohls for the same thing. Not going to do that this time. i will spend the money for a grinder that will last for 10 years. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!"
2,John has done it again!,"John has done it again. I thought Wither's Rain was quite the tumultous ride of terror but he proves with Legacy that Wendy has a lot of horror in store for her (bad for her, great for us, the faithful readers). I was spellbound (pun intended) and gripped. The Wiccan aspects are fascinating and ring true. Wendy is a young Wiccan you can relate to and root for."
2,Pretty Cool,"This is exactly what my daughter asker for for christmas - weird kid. But it's built pretty sturdy and It's small enough for small hands. She wanted a lockable chest, and this one has a cool little skill that locks it closed.It could use a few more things inside, but all in all, my 5-year old loved it."
1,I am bored......,"ILL beats. DECENT rhymes. DMX doesn't really have much to say. how many times can a person say where my dogs at?IN all this album is ILL if you like partying, but it showed not a bit of insight.For those of you who like to listen to versitile rap, DMX is NOT your man. ON this album he talks about the same thing every other rapper does, weed, sex, killing(of course he has a couple of tracks where he tries to come off like a decent man).BEWARE! When you first hear the album you will be enticed by the ILL beats-this is what happened to me. I copped the album from a friend, took it home, played it and then realized that the brother had no REAL lyrical skills-it was strickly beats. I give DMX props in that area because without the beats, he's pretty much outdone by REAL rhymers such as CANIBUS, RAKIM, NAS, etc.peacemic-12"
1,can't finish it,"Unfortunately, I bought this book and was extremely excited. The problem I have with it is that I do not find neglecting a child entertaining or the least bit funny. AT ALL."
1,Very Poorly Written.,"While the Tawni Gomes story is very inspiring, the book is very poorly written. It appears that this book was never proof-read before being published. There is a difference between writing in a conversational style and just being careless. For example this sentence appears on page 105, ""After you race or have a long run, it's a good idea to either take a day off, but if you want to do something, water fitness or a stationary bike are good ways of giving your legs a breather."" Probably the word ""either"" should have been deleted. The book is full of other equally sloppy examples. This kind of error might be acceptable on an internet page or in some other free media. It is not tolerable in a twenty dollar book. I will certainly avoid any other books published by Paper Chase Press."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I bought this game about a year ago for a good price...but guess what it's done for a year. It's sat on my shelf and collected dust. If you haven't gotton my point already...THIS IS A TERRIBLE GAME! First of all, if you think Regis is annoying on T.V.... Also, the questions are almost IMPOSSIBLE to answer. (However, I am only a kid, so adults might argue with that last comment.) Also, if you don't answer the fastest finger question right after a few tries, the game exits! All in all, even though this game is priced good, it's REALLY bad. I'd give it -5 stars if I could."
2,I had bought this product to use to wrap gingerbread on and to bake. I was making a gingerbread castle and needed towers.,They worked great. I will have many baking and deep frying needs for this product. I like to create edible art so the Norpro 3660 stainless steel cannoli rollers will be used alot.
1,All stars equals one star,"Burt Reynolds was the biggest movie star in the world when (1980) he made CANNONBALL RUN. Did he appear in this bomb to test his fans' patience? Did he really think the script was humorous or exciting? Maybe the filmmakers spent so much time recruiting CANNONBALL RUN's all-star cast that they forgot to write jokes or develop any story. Except for Dom Deluise's very funny performance, the only laughs are at the paying audience's expense. Burt Reynolds redeemed himself with the appropriately titled STARTING OVER once the stench of CANNONBALL RUN died down."
1,"Heard it all before, and a long time ago.","The first thoughts that came to mind when listening to this CD was the worst of Malmsteen with a bad Bruce Dickinson soundalike!I also think the somgs and the melodies are a little outdated. But if you haven't heard many shred guitarists (especially from the eighties) and are not interested in commercial songs, then this CD will probably appeal to you."
1,This book helps Hellmuth (not you) make money,"Hellmuth is certainly an accomplished tournament player. However, his tallent must truely be otherworldly to overcome his ego. The book deals almost exclusively with examples of how successful Hellmuth is, and is extremely light on the ""mechanics"" of improving play for the beginning or intermediate player. Likewise, advanced and expert players will find little of value here.Considering Hellmuth's well-documented ego and contempt for ""lesser"" players (watch/read about any major tournament in which he makes an early exit), the one redeeming quality about the book is that it reads like a talk straight from the horse's mouth--if there was a ghostwriter, he did an admirable job of capturing Hellmuth's hubris."
2,Mug,"I am SOOOOOO happy that i bought this tea mug! It's got such a different, yet very comfortable shape. I love drinking from it and it has quickly become my favorite cup. I'd recommend anyone to buy one!"
2,Excellent book on UNIX programming,"It is only book I have seen that illustrate unix programming so clear and so detail. Mr.stevens makes many difficult fetures of unix to easy grasp.In the book ,author describes more than 200 system calls and functions;a brief example accompanies each description. Building upon information presented in the first 15 chapters, the author offers chapter-long examples teaching you howto create a database library, a PostScript printer driver, a modem dialer, and a program that runs other programs under apseudo terminal. To make your analysis and understanding of this code even easier, and to allow you to modify it, all ofthe code in the book is available via UUNET."
1,Hard to swallow,"I have not yet actually taken them.It was my first time taking some about.. an hour ago.The one thing I REALLY don't like is that they're hard to swallow.They're small but,When I opened it, powder came outThe pills look and feel smooth, but once you put water in your mouthIt gets kinda grainy and sticks to your tongue making it hard to swallow.I'll try to keep taking them.I hate pills like these."
2,Great sound,"Amazing sound. I found some new music elements in music I've been here years ago.The only thing is that it really warm my ears, no pain no gain."
2,always on my mind,I read this because my son was reading it in school.Little did i know that I would think about it so often.the tragedy of it all is unbearable.
1,SUCKS!,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Cheaply made junk movie with lousey actors. Don t waste your money. don t take it for free!
2,The Northern Expansion....,"This expansion is the best I have ever seen, baecause it actually improves the game, adding a QUEST- maker, and giving you tons of new creatures, the powerful wendigo, the villanous Greater Gorgon, as well as 4 new unique monsters! The expansion also lets you in on many new buildings, and the quests are challenging and enjoyable. To sweeten things...! ....And, this expansion also ""eqalizes"" heroes, beefing up the ""underdogs"".Bottom Line: Coool in both aspects of price and challenge, a MUST for Majesty Fans!"
2,No Surprises,The best part of this experience was there were no surprises. The popper works well with a few shortcomings that I expected. Typically ejects a few popped and unpopped kernels during the popping process even thought I angle it at certain times to reduce the quantity. Don't mind having to unplug it since I have to to put it away.The very best part of it is there is essentially no cleanup. That I really like and why I use it more than my stovetop popper which makes better popcorn.
2,Great dance songs for a fun movie,This CD is awesome! Makes you want to get up and dance. It fits great with the movie (which was funny) and has a lot of energy. Great for the dancers in all of us.
2,Rolling Stone Magazine,Rolling Stone magazine has been THE magazine for music and pop culture since it began in 1967. It also has excellent political pieces which I enjoy as well. It is a magazine that many should subscribe to.
1,Hateful Antisemitic Sewage,"One of the most bizarre antisemitic rants since 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' I've seen Jews blamed for a lot of things, but blaming Jews for antisemitism gets into a whole new level of psychopathic delusion -- either that, or plain, stone-hearted malice. Much of the material in this festering boil of a book, especially the conclusion, would have left Joseph Goebbels nodding in admiration. Cambridge University Press has utterly disgraced itself by publishing this vicious tripe."
2,Amazing peeler,"I bought this peeler when my old one died in my arms and I have to bury it in my backyard with tears in my eyes and a feeling that I will never be able to find the right peeler again that would be so easy on hands. Then I found Oxo peeler at amazon and read all the reviews. I was thrown with one of the most interesting problem since Einstein solved the relativity problem, pay little bit more for Oxo or get a $5-$6 peeler.I am glad that I made this decision to buy Oxo, it was super nice on hands (grip is awesome). Peeling strokes are smooth, balance is just right. No more tears as this peeler is robust!Highly recommended!"
1,Junk,"Does not work. Used these Memorex ultra speed CD-RW's on an LG burner and a NEC burner on windows XP. All 5 CD's in the pack appeared to record on the first try. But no data was there when trying to read the CD's. All 5 of the discs cannot be burned a second time, even after doing a full erase, always getting an ""Illegal Disc Error"" on the LG burner or a ""Write Error"" on the NEC Burner.I purchased a 5-pack of Verbatim 24 times CD-RW. Tested all 5 CD's in the pack. All 5 recorded perfectly twice. One of the CD's has been rewritten more then 50 times so far, without one fail with the same computer set-up and the same LG and NEC burners."
1,Jane Austin would be outraged,"I found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable, however that was not the worst of it. There were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading Pride and Prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous. Conversations and situations so mimicked Austin's books that it bordered on plagiarism Vert disappointing"
2,Great Book,This was an excellent book to read. Very detailed regarding what really happened according to the Bible. Loved the style of writing by this author. Easy reading and easy to understand. Made me realize where I am at this point in my life. What happened in this story could and does happen today. Loved the book and was eager to read more by this author.
2,Ham Radio for Dummies Useful To Already Licensed Amateur Operators,"I earned my Extra class license within one year of beginning the process. I own or have studied the classic ARRL library of amateur radio handbooks. But this Dummies edition says it all in ways that are easier to understand and that point the reader to additional, more detailed sources. I also purchased a second copy for my 15 year old grand son who is working on Eagle Scout and who will take a scouting class in amateur radio with his scout troop. Ham Radio for Dummies provides a medium for technical conversation between my grand son and me. If he remains interested, he will have my equipment and call sign for his own."
2,Best Game for a Family,This is the best game that we have played in a while. It allows us as a family of four to play all together and it's just so much fun!
1,"Just Misery...Know Sula, No Peace...","SULA, I don't know why folks have been saying this book was hard to read, I read it in 2 days, while watching basketball play-offs! It was not difficult at all. This is the 2nd book by Morrison I've read, the other was THE BLUEST EYE. I don't like Morrison and she is not so great a writer to me. I don't understand how people reviewing this book could say it was a ""masterpiece"" or ""so meaningful to me""! It was about a dysfunctional family, hell a dysfunctional town. I don't get how this could be ""the best I've read"". Hell, it was depressing and Sula Peace had no peace at all. I really felt sorry for Nel because she befriended such a s.o.b. as Sula. I'd hate to have her as my only friend. Generation after generation was off from Eva, to Hannah, to Sula! Pick up a book that has some happiness about it instead of this.Just my 2 cents!"
1,More Beginning OO than UML...,"My rating is based on the comparison of the book's title to its content. I was expecting an advanced book on the UML for the seasoned developer based on the title.What I got was a beginner's introduction to OO develelopment. In fact, the authors state on page 293 in the Afterword:We've tried to keep this book simple. [...] If this book helps you get a feel for OO development and makes it possible for you to generate diagrams [...], we've done what we set out to do.Don't be tricked me into purchasing the book by the misleading title. UML is discussed, but not in depth. If you're new to OO development, this book may be a good introduction. It also gives a fairly good introduction to the UML.But a better book for just an introduction to UML is:UML Distilled: applying the standard object modeling language by Martin Fowler with Kendall ScottAnd for a more in-depth book, I liked:The Unified Modeling Language User Guide by the three amigos"
1,...,"I bought this camera a few months ago expecting it to have thesame average quality as other instant cameras.When I brought it homeand started to take pictures, I realized that I had been ripped off. I never bothered to buy extra film for the camera because the pictures were so blurry and distorted. The camera just sits in a drawer never to be used again."
1,Mercy Falls - Good till the end.,"Krueger's ending sucked in my opinion. I wanted to tear it out and rewrite it. I don't want to wait months to see what the hero, Cork, does next. It really ticked me off. The book, till the ending was great, as has been all his Iron Lake stories."
1,Horrible,"I ordered the bag through Amazon and was really excited about getting a new camera bag. When I opened the box I had no idea that bag was going to be so large. It is huge, bulky, and unrealistic. If I would have known the bag was so misrepresented online I would not have gotten it.When I tried to return I noticed that there was no packing slip. I called Lowpro...no answer. I wrote emails to Lowpreo... no answer. Weeks later when I finally managed, through amazon, to find them they sent me their ""new adress"" to send the iteam back. I sent the bag over a week ago to the address that I was given. That address does not true and I have not been payed back for thrying to return the bag. All in all this is a horrible product with a horrible company."
2,My son still plays with this a year later...,"Totally cute costume set. My son and daughter love dressing up and as a mom I like the safety of the cape being attached, rather than tying around the neck. The cute box (""trunk"") it came in arrived totally thrashed with no apparent discount, but that would have probably broken over time anyway. Overall, a product with longlasting value!"
2,"Excellent Bass, a Little bulky","I just got this headset from Best Buy. I paid a little extra there because of the counterfeit scare in the online world! However, I just love the sound. Specially the bass. Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass. My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly. The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm. I would give it a 5 star but it's a little bulky for the gym. The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long. The shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out."
1,What was I thinking?,"I have heard references to the book in question for many years. I was looking forward to the chance to finally read it, but I was sorely disappointed. I found the book very dry and extremely difficult to understand. All I can say about those who have praised this book is that they surely must be more intelligent than I.Machiavelli starts out on the very first page by saying that ""I have not sought to adorn my work with long phrases or high-sounding words or any of those superficial attractions and ornaments with which many writers seek to embellish their material..."" This statement is a mockery of itself. This whole drawn-out book is filled with embellishments of all sorts and it is beyond me how Lorenzo the Magnificent, the prince who Machiavelli wrote the book for, ever managed to get through it.After reading every last page, I am still as clueless as when I began. ..."
1,Worst Ive Ever Read!!,Im sorry but this book was the WORST book I've EVER read! Mabye It's just because i dont enjoy reading about a stupid monkey that knows kung fufu and wants to live forever!!!!! It had no point!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,probablly one of the more all around enjoyable,"well rtest assured this the least action oriented chapter in the series since uh the first one, but like the older star wars films it still has a good charachters. The plot seems a little too much like a overblown series episode but The nice brisk direction from Leonard Nemoy makes the film enjoyable and probablly the most light hearted of the series. Hardcore fans will probablly grope but I got into Star Trek mainly because of the chrachters not so much the horrible special effects and sometimes the nice twists thrown in each film got me into them. It still is a nice change of pace of the melodrama serounding 2 and 3 (although those are both pretty good films,especially kahn."
1,Janky,"I purchased this item direct from the Ultimate Body Press web site, and will be returning it. I was very disappointed with the janky quality...it should have been more like $50! The entire unit wiggles and seems of very poor design for the money it cost. There is about an inch of wiggle room when just applying pressure to one side with my finger....the whole thing just slants over. It is a simple design and I'm sure it could have been made a little more sturdy....it's just very cheap looking/feeling. I could build a stronger unit myself for 1/10 of the cost........and since this thing doesn't have any real advantages; like folding for storage, you might as well just construct your own unit and save a lot of money AND about 4 weeks of time (the time it took for me to receive mine after ordering it)."
1,Super annoying!!!,"This movie doesn't deserve more than 2 or 3 sentences. So, here it goes. Rob Zombie's Halloween II has stupid characters (whom you wouldn't mind if they all died with the exception of Sheriff Brackett and Lori's poor friend Mya). The dialogue is redundant and unintelligible. You're left with wanting more plot. A waste of time. I was expecting more from Rob Zombie than something as dumb and blunt as this movie. That's it. That's the review."
2,Well done,I bought this starter for my Infinity i30. It fits perfectly and works flawlessly without any side noises or backups.
1,"Repetitive, boring","Too long, too repetitive and almost no dialogue creates an extended agony that sometimes might be confusing."
1,In a word: Useless,"Don't waste your money on this completely ineffective product. I bought this spray bottle of glass cooktop cleaner thinking that it would be an easy way to maintain the look of my stove top. After using it several times according to the manufacturer's directions, I am completely disgusted. It doesn't remove anything, even after letting it sit on the stains for over an hour. The product instructions direct you to remove any cooked-on stains with a scraping blade prior to using it. Once you've done that, there is no need to use this cleaner at all - plain water would be just as effective. I now use Cerama Bryte with a damp Magic Eraser on my cooktop, and it works beautifully. I feel like sending this product back to Reckitt Benckiser and demanding a refund!"
1,This book is for retarded,"I meant to put no stars on this book at all.The author can't even write more than two sentences before running into some concepts which he could not understand or could not explain. Same thing happened in all those ""admiring"" comments on this board. Either they are just hired pumpers, or they could only ramble on something they could not understand just like the author himself did in this book.DO NOT WAIST TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE."
1,Punk? yeah right,"Little preppy kids, this is NOT punk, this is pure pop with guitars. I can't stand this group, they sound like all the other pop bands out there like bad charlotte, sum 41, and blink 182. There is no orginality here, all the songs sound the same. these guys are as punk as NSTYNC. If you want to listen to real punk rock get a Dead kennedys, rancid, bad religon or sex pistols cd!"
2,Works great for what its supposed to do.,"This version comes with a massive list of games and codes to use out of the box, but I did have a problem. I tried to use the preset codes on a ""Greatest Hits"" version of the game and found out that it would not work. So I found out that if i used a USB drive to update the games i wanted with CB's Day 1 service it would work. Other than that it works fine."
1,Fematril failure!,"i was very disappointed with this product , not only did it not work for me, i found it gave me headaches & nausea.The product does not mention side affects,so be warned it could be a waste of money!"
1,Voice Changer? No.,"Length:: 2:43 MinsThis is not a voice changer, this is something that kind of adds on to your voice, droning in the background.I put it on, and of course, like all the ""1""s said, the head peace busted right off (that's what I get for being born with a big head) --- but it's not as bad as they say, you can put it back on if you know how to work it right...But lets get real, this thing does not make you sound like Darth unless you have your ear right up to the little speaker that will sit on your chest.It's really kind of weird that they put the speaker at the base of the control panel... if you were really short, and the person wearing it were really tall, maybe then it would make sense...Anyway, long story short, but the TRANSFORMERS voice changing helmet... the Darth Vader one is kind of lame."
1,not a good pick,"I think that The Catcher in the Rye is a sad portrayl of a young and confused teenager. The book did not interest me at all and the constant use of profanity made the book even worse. There seemed to be no plot and when I thought the book was actually going some where, I ran into another dead end. It did bring up a few desent points, but other than that I have to say that I give the book a thumbsdown. I hope some liked it, but as for me, I found nothing interesting about it."
2,Good value,"Bought these chips as a gift. They are good value. A few chips have minor flaws, but not bad enough to bother exchanging them. I recommend this set, and the seller (ChipsAndGames) for their fast delivery."
2,A Hilarious Family Film!!!!!!,"This is a funny, warm, and family-togetherness movie! If you're a fan of the Brady Bunch, you have to see this. Original and a great film!!!!!!!"
2,The Mighty Spinners...,"3 1/2 stars? O.K. - 4 stars. I am a huge Spinners fan and although I enjoyed this DVD, I felt I might have enjoyed it more. All the great songs are there, and the Bonus section has an extensive interview with the group. However, there was something slightly lackluster about the show - perhaps the subdued audience, or the aging performers themselves. Or the disparity that exists between our memories of the polished studio recordings of the songs and the (unavoidably) inferior live stage versions. Or maybe I'm just being too picky - I don't know. At any rate, Spinners fans (or fans of the genre) will still like this DVD, so by all means check it out. And for what it's worth, I saw the Spinners in a live show recently and was glad I did. It was pretty much the same act as on this DVD. They put 100% of themselves into their performance, and are truly a ""class"" act. But for the reasons stated, I'll refrain from giving it the ultimate 5 star rating."
1,I'm torn...,"I don't whether to laugh, cry or vomit. His singing is horrendous, and may give me nightmares tonight. Two words.Download this. Trust me the RIAA will not care but they may put you in a padded cell. Oh lord...my ears, my ears."
2,"Love the bag, stitching needs improvement",I bought 3 of these bags in different colors and LOVE them. The only reason I didn't get them a 5 star is that after the first wash the stitching started to come undone. It's an easy fix if you know how to sew. The bags store a days worth of prefold cloth diapers for my 18 month old. They keep the odors contained and are great for on the go. Despite the stitching problem I think they're a great value and product.
2,Wonderful Study on the Indians,A great read!! Really will hold your attention. I read it in a weekend.
2,some really great songs...,"i really like this cd, some really good lyrics and a good sound. the album has a very nice flow to it, it's a nice album to listen to. the songs ""Saints and Angels"", ""I Keep Looking"" (can't really argue ;)there is always something...),""I learned that from you"", ""Let's Dance"", ""you don't"" and ""Four-Thirty"" are the ones i think is the best on this album.... This is a good album worth a listen."
1,False advertizing,"I had a large metal lasagna pan that measured 3""X11""X16"". The Teflon coating was wearing off and it was beginning to rust. I was specifically looking for a large stainless steel pan similar to this. They claimed the product dimensions were 12.4 x 3.5 x 18.8 inches ; 4 pounds. When in fact it was 10 x 2.75 x 14. I was very disappointed."
2,JUDE IS THE BEST!,"I MUST ADMIT I AM A ROOTS ROCK 40 SOMETHING GUY...THAT SAID, I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM RECOMMENDINGJUDE TO ANYBODY. HIS SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE SOMEOF HIS BEST. ""SHEILA DON'T REMEMBER"" IS THE BESTSELF-DEPRICATING SONG IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC.HIS GUITAR PLAYING IS SOLID AS IS HIS SINGING ANDWRITING. EVERYONE I'VE EVER PLAYED THIS FOR WANTEDA COPY OR MORE OF HIS STUFF. I WISH HE WOULD PLAYCLUBS (HINT) HERE IN THE MIDWEST OR TEAM UP WITH MYFRIEND BILL LLOYD IN NASHVILLE. HEY JUDE! GET OUTOF THE HOUSE AND ROCK! MIKE"
1,lworks,Didnt leak. The handle came apart real quick. It holds water in the cap and when you unscrew it the water spills out. Wouldnt recommend.
1,Such a long winded read.,"Although promising much, the book gets bogged down in many places. She also repeats herself too often. It felt like a real chore to keep reading."
1,Their Greatest Hits-Herman's Hermits-(Abkco),"This is the first CD of Herman's Hermits music available in the U.S.A. from one of the truly great groups of the early 60's. It was the first taste of Herman's Hermits on CD for this fanatic fan of Peter ""Herman"" Noone & his chaps!! However, this CD has some real draw backs as Peter Noone & The Hermits are NOT compensated for it's sale. Allen Klein who controls all Herman's Hermits songs in America has NOT paid ANY royalities to Peter & the boys to this day. If that doesn't turn you off, the music's sound will as it's very poorly remastered....Allen, can't you even do a decent job for the fans when you are making all the profits! Fortunately, for fellow fans there are plenty of super imports out there. Check out some of Olaf Owre's reviews."
1,Just Awful....,"I saw U2 last night and was made to endure almost 45 minutes of the Kings of Leon. I liked the guitars, but the singer's voice is simply AWFUL!!!!!!! Fortunately, U2 saved the day with a terrific show, but, if you can help it, don't touch the Kings of Leon with a 10 foot pole."
1,not good,"starts hard,takes awhile to get up to speed,speed lever gets in the way,once it's going it's fine"
2,Great Ink Cartridge,"This ink cartridge is one of two needed for my HP PhotoSmart printer. The printer, when used with this and the other (C3844A) in cartridge, produces amazing, photo-quality prints."
1,Review,"The product looked good when delivered, when my son tried to open it to get the $ out it broke. Would not recommend purchasing. It's a good idea but not durable."
1,advertized to support mac os x? I think not,"when I purchased this unit, it had been advertized to support mac os 9.x and higher (including mac os x). what I got caused my notebook (g3 lombard with OS X 10.4.10) to crash immediately upon plugin.adaptec has no information on their site regarding this card. I will be contacting amazon to get my money back or trade for a SUITABLE replacement that will work with my machine!"
2,A great gift!,"I was given this booster seat from a friend. I live in a really tiny house - so tiny that there is no room for a kitchen table! Because of this, at first I didn't think I would find much use for a booster seat. Was I ever wrong. I use it in the living room so my daughter can (have a dry) snack with me, play with play doh, draw, etc. I just attach the back of the chair to the coffee table leg so that the chair is stable. It is also much easier to bring along to functions as compared to a high chair. It also comes in handy when we are one high chair short, such as when we had a Passover dinner at my dad's house and my friends brought along their 2 year-old; instead of having them lug their high chair down there, I brought along the booster seat."
1,Crash and burn,"Very frustrating to trouble shoot print head problems and ink tank issues.Started out as a love affair. Ended up with desire to throw it on a junk pile.Treat this printer like a disposable lighter - get a cheaper one, and throw it away when you are done."
2,A Must Buy!,"First, these outstanding songs were performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, one of the BEST orchestra in the world!The LSO has a great reputation for playing Rock & Pop music, and they done it again with this album. I really love some tracks, like Night in White Satin, House of Rising Sun, Bohemian Rhapsody, Another Brick in the Wall and Layla. The atmosphere was grand, and that helped unleashed the spirit of the songs."
2,Best Incomplete Book,"I read this book several years ago as an Advanced Reader's Copy. I loved it from the very beginning to the end (although I thought the end of the book was lacking). I had never read anything by this author before and I hear that this book was actually a step away from her usual fare; I only wish that people had caught on to this one. I wanted there to be a sequel so bad that I kept looking for a follow-up for years. I hope that Haines does produce another book like this one. Hopefull with this new Kindle edition there will be a follow-up.If you liked The Help, you will love this book."
1,The worst Danielle Steel book I've ever read.,"All of the women in my family have always been Danielle Steel fans, and several years ago I began to read her books as well. I have never read one I did not like...until now. My Grandmother lent me the book and told me not to bother because it was horrible, but I couldn't beleive Danielle Steel could write a bad book. When I began the book it was fine. Once the klone arrived it all went down hill...way down hill. It was too far fetched for my taste. Hopefully Danielle Steel will stick to her previous writing style in the future."
2,Love to open wine now,I have seen this product at wine bars and wanted it for myself. I first used it at a party and soon all my guests were trying it out. Then I bought 2 more for gifts and they all love it. Great idea for anyone who enjoys wine.
2,Flawless!,"This really is a terrific recording of both pieces. Lush, tight performances. Lush, vivid sound."
2,excellent masks,"These masks are much better than the cheaper masks. the straps are much more durable, the valves are a must if you need to wear glasses or goggles.Worth the extra money."
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"I am truly disapointed with this CD. It seems as though she is trying to achieve a more sophisticated sound and it is not working. Instead it sounds like music for older people. Mary J is labeled as being the queen of hip-hop but she forgot the hip-hop when making this CD. There are only 2 nice songs, beautiful one and all that I can say. Well all that I can say is I doubt very seriously that I will ever buy another Cd made by her"
1,Not a quality item,"I've had two Waterpiks in the last year. The first one broke after 6 months. This one the water line is so coiled, you can't close the lid without problems with jamming. Other Waterpik tips are not interchangeable."
1,Typical Ford,"I knew Ford personally for many years and I was NOT surprised that he went the route he did - leaving Eckankar - but just that he left in such anger. I have never based my truth on what someone else did, or didn't do, what Paul Twitchell did or didn't do, but rather on what my own inner experiences have taught me. And that is what Paul Twitchell encouraged. This is a training ground for mastership, this world and the negative power, and I don't expect perfection or truth outside of my own heart and inner connection. People of the mind are easily swayed into useless arguments. People of the heart forgive, forget and move on towards truth. Eckankar wasn't always called Eckankar, but the teachings of the Light and Sound, and the Blue Light of the Mahanta has always been your very own heart...throughout time"
2,A Much Needed History Lesson,"I highly recommend this book. It's very informative and lists all the sources to back up what is written within. While I recommend this book for everyone, I would especially recommend this book for all professing Christians."
1,"Same old, same old","What a disappointment. As an experienced teacher, I should've been more careful. There are NO examples, no new stories, nothing original or new. The same graphic organizers we have all seen. Save your money and buy something else. From now on, I think I will preview at the bookstore before I purchase through internet."
1,Redundant Rambling Fiction,"It is common knowledge that this book is really a pile of lies. It isn't much of an autobiography and leaves the reader wondering which, if any, parts of it to really consider seriously.It is truly painful to read due to the unending redundant rambling nature of Menchu's storytelling.I cannot believe that this garbage is still being assigned as required reading. Worthless."
1,I want my money back,"Having read and enjoyed many of the author's previous novels, was surprised to find this deeply disappointing and predictable - strange that an armchair reader could forecast immediately what the experienced government agent could not! The few females appeared as one-dimensional characters, obviously only there to provide the compulsory sexual element. The national stereo-types were laughable (dodgy Cockney chap; cold, indifferent Chinese). The wet ending did provide one surprise, although if I had not been brain dead by this time, I probably could have worked this out too."
2,Nice Spray Pattern,"The unit has a nice spray pattern, however, it is almost impossible to the insert the ""round"" handheld head into the fixed ""horseshoe"" head without causing the fixed head to move. It would be better if the opening in the fixed head was a little wider. Also, I had to wrap the threads of the connections between both heads and the diverter with teflon tape to stop them from leaking."
1,Did not make clear- would not work on US DVD player,I was disappointed it did not make clear that it would not work on US DVD player. Too expensive to send back.
1,I CAN'T STAND STYX!!!!,"This is the type of music that real rockers make fun of! The horrible squealing on ""Come Sail Away"" is pure torture to the listener! Try listening to BOSTON or BAD COMPANY first. They could teach STYX a thing or two about real rock 'n' roll!!"
2,Taking Chance,"Taking Chance is a humanitarian story involving a little known part of a soldier's loss of life. Inspired by the true story of United States Marine, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl, who volunteered to escort the remains of a nineteen year old soldier (Lance Corporal Chance Phelps) who was killed during active duty in Iraq to his final resting place in distant Wyoming. Strobel, (Kevin Bacon) makes it his personal mission to prepare this young soldier for his journey home with respectful honor while gaining further insight of human sacrifice. A compassionate story."
1,I don't get it,"I really don't see the hype behind this collection of so-called fairy tales. I found them tedious, redundant, and shallow."
1,Yikes!,I read the reviews before buying this coffeemaker and disregarded the ones about it overflowing as fluks or that the users didn't follow the instructions. That was a mistake. I read the instructions. It overflowed everytime I used it. I returned it. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this machine.
2,It's not a shovel - it's better!,"The thing you have to get used to is thinking of this as a snow sled rather than a snow shovel. The big scoop allows you to pack 40 lbs of soggy, heavy snow in one run. Then you just tip it up a bit and glide this heavy load across the top of the snow to your dumping spot. Once you get there, you just jerk back quickly to pull the scoop out from under the snow, like a magician pulling a tablecloth from under the dishes on a table. It helps to jerk back while the snow still has forward momentum.Ideally, you should plan your paths so that you're always transporting the snow downhill to your dump spot. You can pile successive dumpings up to build a ramp, if you need to. This is so much more effective at moving snow quickly that I can't imagine having to go back to using just a regular shovel. You can use this to quickly supply lots of snow for building an excellent snow fort too."
2,"Lone Arrow's Pride, Karen Kay","This is a great book. It takes you back to the Old West and the Native American people. A wondeful story about love, understanding about different cultures and trouble that can cause. It is also light and fun to read. Karen Kay has done it again!"
2,Good CD start to finish,"I, personally, am tired of hearing the terms over-produced, sellout and what-not. I am also tired of people saying ""Oh he sounds so much better live"" and your are half right...folks this isn't a live CD nor is it a live performance, it is a studio recording. If the live Howie sounded just like the studio Howie what would be the point of paying to see him live. That being said, bring on the ""over-produced, sellout"" Stop All The World Now, I really enjoyed this CD because it is good...plain and simple. I have also read some of the reviews comparing Perfect Time Of Day to U2 as if that is a negative...is it so bad that someone sees some (I repeat SOME) similarities to one of the most influential, and poignant bands of the past 20 to 30 years. I would consider it an honor personally...regardless this is a good CD and like Howie says on the DVD a good snapshot of where he is musically today...to Howie - keep those snapshots coming."
1,Disappointing,"This was a disappointing purchase. These are not full size makers, the telescoping tower doesn't really function well and only a few of the markers are scented. If I had seen this in person first I would not of purchased this."
1,"great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go","great for 6 year old boys, adults kind of boring! very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go"
2,Zico coconut water,This is the best tasting coconut water out there!I have tried many but Zico tastes like it was just poured from a freshly plucked coconut.
1,Power switch broke the first time out,"We were very sad that during the first time to use this toy, the power switch fell off. We were able to make 3 pictures and then into the trash it went. We are now looking for one from another brand if someone else makes one."
2,Arthriflex Tablets,I've tried every product out there that contains glucosamine & chondroitin but Arthri-flex is the ONLY one that truly WORKS.
2,Should actually be pretty good....,"New Year's Revolution 2006 has been building up to be A LOT better than last year. Although the Elimination Chamber match will take place again for two years in a row, the rest of the card will be better than last year.Matches:WWE ChampionshipElimination Chamber Match:Kurt Angle vs. Kane vs. Carlito vs. John Cena [champion] vs. Chris Masters vs. Shawn MichalesTriple H vs. The Big ShowWomen's Championship:Trish Stratus [Champion] vs. Mickie JamesIntercontinental Championship:Ric Flair [Champion] vs. EdgeOther possible MatchesShelton Benjamin vs. ?Chavo Guerrero vs. ?More Matches need to be announced........"
2,Don't even consider another brand!,"Baby Bjorn is the best carrier ever! They are easy to get in and out of and it is very comfortable for both mom and dad to wear. I tried several brands and went with this one, my advice is.....I wouldn't even consider another brand. Sounds like I work for them, but I don't just love the product."
2,worth its weight in gold,"Useful as Gillette Edmunds' other book (""How to Retire Early and Live Well"") is, I wished it had been possible to read this one first! For anyone who's been duped into believing stock funds are the only viable long-term hedge against inflation, who's been sold a ""conservative"" asset allocation and then watched it lose 25% of its value, this book is a lifesaver.Simply by working through the steps here and understanding what mixture of ""saver,"" ""investor,"" and ""speculator"" you are will result in greatly increased clarity and vastly lower stress. Belongs at the top of the list of books the typical financial advisor would prefer you not know about!"
2,Works well,I needed more hubs for some accessories and all I had was an old 1.0 4 port hub. I started reading reviews and thought this one would do the trick. Well it works very well with my external hard drive. If your looking to add more ports to your system this one's the one.
2,a fantastic hidden rt gem,"Sunnyvista is probably RT's least known album yet it is one of his best. What I love about this album is that it sounds absolutely unlike any of his other albums up to that point or even after. Most of these songs have just great rhythms that at first seem like upbeat songs. Heck, Civilzation is a reggae song! Hoewever, as with any RT song, the lyrics can be just devastating and cutting.The overriding theme of this album is how so many people have just given in to society and its demands of conformity to ideals that really are of little importance. This is well worth getting (much easier to get and cheaper on cassette (ebay) since it's out of print) and is essential for any rt fan.Their are so many great songs but Living on Borrowed Time and Lonely Hearts are just wonderful songs that have such great melodies."
1,"spend a few more bucks and get the leatherman micra, its worth it","I recently had my Leatherman Micra confiscated at the airport (forgot to put it in my checked luggage and they don't allow such things as carry-on items anymore!), so I headed to target to purchase a replacement Micra as I use it frequently at work.I saw the Gerber shortcut at almost half the price and had heard Gerber made a good multitool, so I gave it a shot.Bad idea! The scissors especially is much weaker and has a lot of trouble cutting through things the micra just tore through. Especially plastic loading straps. The gerber scissors 'bounce' off the loading straps more often than not, and often get dislocated trying to make a cut. Whereas the Leatherman micra could often cut two at a time.This one LOOKS cooler, but does not handle the same workload. Decide what is more important to you."
2,yuiogh cards,The cards were in excellent condition. Great value for the money. My 2 sons loved them for christmas. Fast delievery.
2,Great pruner,"The pruning part works great. I thought I'd be using the saw more than the pruner, but it turns out I was wrong. 1.25 inches is big enough for most of what I thought I'd have to saw off.The saw works fine ,but when you're working at full extension it takes some patience to cut through a thicker limb due to the amount of flex in the blade and the heft of the pole. If I had to actually saw more limbs instead of using the pruner, I would probably get a better single purpose pole saw only instead of a combo tool."
1,misleading advertisment and service,"The cd was in japenese for Teresa Tong, and wouldn't give back credit or refund. Terrible, terrible, and unreasonable!"
1,HORRIBLE CAMERA,"I was in Walmart looking for a digital camera, and came across this cute little thing. I saw it was a 3.2 MP, being a decent picture. I was sold solely on the compact look,the price and i assumed it has alright quality. (the pic's took ok in the store but only b/c of how bright it is in there)I got it home, and took a few shots, they were no good. so i thought id keep it for the weekend and play around with it, thinking i needed to get to know my camera. WRONG!! this thing doesnt get better!!! its horrible. the quality is crappy. the pictures blurr. the flash is delayed for 10 sec. u cant take a pic closer than 5 ft away from object (ex. fun pics of u and ur friends/family where u hold it out in front on you) the pics will come out white!!! BAD BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!! BEWARE"
1,Disappointing book,"A compendium of different stories featuring several writers and artists.This doesn't work for me. Most of the artwork featured here is goofy and experimental and frankly, too short. One huge chunk of the book features a text discussion and description on the death of Cap America which is really not part of a comic book.This is Captain America in Heavy Metal style, acting more like a showcase for different sages out there."
1,Earl Grey,Did not like this tea. It smelled so strong right out of the box that I never brewed it. Won't buy it again.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This is a scam. For example, the most useful number he gives is 202-555-1212 YES! that's general information for D.C. Please, do not buy this book......it is terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Crysis,"If you have a good machine with at least 2 gigs of RAM, you're going to love this one. Graphics are spectacular and the storyline has some great twists."
1,the usual feminist literature-very biased and anti-male,"With her daughter in tow, judy mann sees the world from only one perspective, the female. Her research is almost ridiculous..she blames a little girls passivity on how her father holds her. Mann becomes angry discussing how fathers in India favor male children, yet lauds the role of women years ago who decided whether a child should live or die...Mann finishes her book by mentioning how in pre-history women led society in a ""Vision Quest"" what ever that is. a totally useless book."
1,aESOP'S FABLES,i WAS THINKING THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE STORY ON THE VIDEO AND THE CD DIDN'T WORK AT ALL
2,They got both,"It's not often we get a chance to look at class, poverty and race in a way which isn't almost guaranteed to be polarised at the outset. Having a disaster as impersonal as Katrina gives Dyson just the backdrop needed to show that much of what happened to the poor of New Orleans (and in particular the black poor) was the result of systemic problems; related directly to how we, as a society, treat the poor, and those whom we marginalise, caused much of what what went wrong.The book doesn't address (at least in the first edition) why it is that New Orleans has not been rebuilt, but the same forces which neglected the city for so long, are probably critical to the lack of real rebuilding.For anyone who wants a starting point to look at race, and poverty in the United States, this makes a good one. The writing is plain, but not dumbed down, and the bibliography is complete; so the basis for his work is there to be seen; and as a springboard the book is excellent."
1,Awful,Everything about this game is awful when i saw that there was a health & fitness club tycoon i was excited i thought it would be something new and something that no other tycoon game as done yet is make it so you can control a gym well i bought the game and the first mission is impossible to pass unless you cheat i have no idea why like the person that reviewed the game before me he had to cheat then the levels after that it was managable so he was down pat on that....the staff also dont help you unless you tell them who you want them to help...this is one of the worse would go with Mall Of America Tycoon as one of the worse....graphics are awful and blurry as well....every aspect of the game is awful...and there sure as heck could of given us more gym equipment people that made this game should goto a gold's gym to see what they are missing....
1,DeWalt is Much Better,"To insert a bit into the Makita Ultralok, you have to pull the collar back and insert the bit--a two-handed operation. With the DeWalt Rapid Load, you just push the bit in as it is spring-loaded. I would give this 1 star, but most of the hex shank holders work the way the Makita does, and the Makita is of good quality."
1,Faulty dimmer switch,"Beautiful lamp. But, mine came with a faulty dimmer switch for the smaller lamp. I'm still trying to find a replacement."
2,The dark side of diplomacy,Talleyrand is possibly the most intriguing person to come out of the French Revolution. When he is not selling his services to the courts of Europe he is offering the Directory and Napoleon vital information as to how they should conduct foreign affairs. Cooper does a very good job of putting Talleyrand within the context of his times and makes diplomatic history come alive through his traitorous character. For those who understand the basics of the French Revolution and Napoleon this is a great book to expand their knowledge of how these events impacted Europe. If you are writing a diplomatic history this is an essential book that has to be understood. Cooper uses many of Talleyrands writing for his sources and gives the best impression available of the minister.
1,Not a pretty sight,"Full disclosure: I do not know anything about bodhrans. I purchased one for my musician daughter (not a bodhran player either) as a surprise Christmas gift. I liked the sound of the instrument but returned it because the drum head appeared to be defective and I didn't want to give it as a gift.The drum sounded good but the drum head was translucent in three separate areas -I could see my hand through it and it just didn't seem right. The manufacturer said this was not a defect so they would not replace it, but they did refund my money. Buyer beware - the picture shows just the back of the drum. If you know more about bodhrans than I do, and this is how they are suppose to look, then definitely ignore this comment!"
2,Best Work since 1984,"This has to be RUSH's best work since the early 80s. The sound is fresh and modern, yet it is also a throwback to the earlier days of this great band. Gone are the synthetizers and back is the 3 piece set of guitar, bass and drums.Certain songs are quite heavy and blend 2112 with Tool. Songs like Earthshine, Nocture and Freeze rival with any other RUSH classics.Mr. Lifeson FINALLY comes out of the cocoon he has been in since Grade Under Pressure (1984!) and his guitar work is dazzling. Too many RUSH songs since 1984 had seemed ""sanitized"" and muzzled by an overuse of keyboards. Not ""Vapor Trails"". This is a raw, haunting and beautifully heavy album....a true RUSH classic."
2,Like your grandma sitting on the backporch talks,"I went to an all-Texas MeetUp in Austin last weekend. Texas BookCrossers came from all parts to eat lunch together and swap book stories. ""What's your all-time must-read-before-you-die book?"" I asked. Two different BookCrossers named books by T.R. Pearson. Each was amazed to find there was another Pearson fan in the immediate vicinity. So, well, mercy, I had to read Polar, a book that's been languishing in my TBR for months.JennyO described this book perfectly at the MeetUp. ""It's the kind of book where the author rambles around for forty pages and has actually written two pages of plot."" Moreover, JennyO went on, ""T.R. Pearson writes like your grandma sitting on the backporch in the summertime talks."" Recommended."
2,Okay Movie,"I saw this movie yesterday and it's good. It did have a little more violence than part 1. I still think part 1 is good. And this movie should actually be rated R. Well, that's the way it felt for me."
2,More Highs For Slayers,Slayers Next continues the tales of young Lina Inverse and her heroic sidekick Gourry. As she still try to get his sword away from them. This fallow up from the first season is a must watch for an fan of the series. It comes before the so called end before the series so called end of the series. In this series Lina get sucked in to the power struggle of some of the demon lords. I feel for the demon lord. They should of not got on the bad side of Lina Inverse.
1,Very Dissappointed,"I bought this tool at Target with high hopes that I could hang pictures without the help of my never-available, handyman husband. It is impossible to read the leveling device and using the pin to hold it on the wall is impractical since it is damaging. My husband, who is very knowledgeable with tools, told me that I had wasted my money. Black and Decker, you have such great ideas. Please allow your engineers to design something that really works even if it cost more or takes more time to get to market!"
2,Hilarious Romantic Mystery,"Bubbles in Trouble the second `bubble' book and you take a trip to Amish County to uncover a murder, bad land deals and drugs. Bubbles Yablonsky goes undercover which means no spandex, no showers and no makeup. The growing relationship with Bubbles and Stiletto is sweet and scrupulous. If you enjoy Jennifer Cruise or Janet Evanovich's then take a chance on the `Bubble Series'."
2,Great,"Works great! I spend ALOT of time driving for work and my car only had one outlet, now I can charge my GPS, phone, everything all at once. Definitely a good purchase!"
1,The jerky controls made us dizzy,"When we first unwrapped this game, we were very excited because of the retro style cars and simplistic game play. Initially, we were very rough with the controls but hoped to improve our driving skills over time. However, after playing for 1/2 hour, we were still tail-spinning and ramming into walls. The controls are non-intuitive (joystick uses only left-right action with slow response times) and the cars are extraordinarily difficult to maneuver (the accelerator is either up or floored...and the car doesn't move forward unless the accelerator is depressed). After an hour or so, we closed our eyes to relieve the nausea and returned to SSX :-)"
1,"This trap is toy, and does not work at all","I puchased the trap, first it was dificullt to set it up and at the same time install tha bate on the tray. This trap has two sides for the animal to enter, and there is only one entrac emight catch the chicmunk, or mouse, the other dor, animal can enter and stand on the trap tray and eat the bate and go out without being cut.Problem: The trap is to short for the small animals to be cut, because the tail of the animal prevents the the trap door close properly, therfore the animal can scape the trap everytime. The trap should have been 13-14"" long to acommodate for the tail. I am sorry to purchase a toy rather then a trap. I waisted alot of nuts"
2,PRETTY GOOD VACUUM,"I bought this vacuum cleaner when my other one conked out a few weeks ago. Even though I've only had this vacuum for 2 days,it's a pretty good vacuum cleaner. It seems to pick up everything off the carpet and suck it right up. It's a tad noisy but then again what vacuum cleaner itsn't???The only thing that I didn't like was when I took it out the box I had to put a few pieces together.. I mean I put them together ok (..or at least I think I did...) :\I don't like to read insructions... especially when they're in cartoon and not the real picture of the product. I have a hard time following directions when it's not the real pic. So if pieces start flying as I vacuum then I'll know that I didn't put it together o.k.Overall it's a great vacuum for the money."
2,OUTSTANDING!,it's such a shame more people don't know about this show---there's really nothing like it out there---a series to be treasured. renzo and marina forever!
2,Go Insane is genius at his best!,"Lindsey Buckingham is a creative genius but with Go Insane, he shatters the boundaries set by other artists. The title track without a doubt is my favorite song by him ever!"
2,Great and funny!,"This book is hilarious! From philosophical wagon rides to alien invaders (""They want $10"") this book covers the life of the prank-playing Calvin and his stuffed tiger, Hobbes, who comes to life when no one is watching. It is an excllent book, and I think that anyone who reads it will remember doing the same thing themselves when they were little."
2,Great,The only extender that works with Belkin router.Worked exactly as I expected.Contacted Belkin once and it performs perfectly.
1,TOO MUCH TALK,"It would have been a much better dvd if Barry Manilow had done more singing and less talk, talk, talk...Plus alot of what he had to say was very self-serving..."
2,Good buy,Used with a Pentax K-x.1) It works from the front of the camera only2) There is only one button but Bulb mode works (you can specify a setting in the camera such that you press once to fire and press again to stop)3) Tiny! I dropped it on a dark cold night outside and if someone didnt see me drop it it would've been gone.
2,Life For Rent,"This is an album that has grown on me a little more with each listen. At first, only a few songs stood out. With time, others seeped their way into my brain and became favorites. The lead single ""White Flag"" is my favorite song. Maybe cliche, but the song is great and vocally she sounds excellent, not to mention it has a great hook and overall is an incredible pop song that is very memorable. I like the song ""Don't Leave Home"" as well, there is a warmth to her vocals that gives depth to the song (and others). The title track is a nice confessional ballad. ""Stoned"" is another favorite, it has an electronica flair, it definately grew on me a lot. Other favorites include ""See You When You're 40"", ""Who Makes You Feel"", ""This Land Is Mine"", and ""Do You Have A Little Time""."
1,All my photos are blury,"I own 3 digital cameras and this is by far the worst. Every photo i take with this camera is blurry. Photos i take with my Canon 1.3 megapixel camera are far superior. The sliding lens cover has also broken and requires me to fidget with the device to close the lens. While i love the lightweight aspect of this olympus, i think its a total waste. go for the new casio (with optical zoom) instead!"
1,"Well Played, But Not What I Was Looking For","The University of Michigan band plays these 41 songs very well. However, the style is not what I was looking for. I wanted to hear the fight songs the way I would hear them on Saturday afternoon at the stadium. Instead, they play the music way I would hear it at the end-of-the-year sit-down concert in the auditorium. Even with their own ""The Victors"" fight song. Not the CD I would play to get pumped up for the big game. If you're looking for the marching band type of sound, try ""Touchdown!"" by Florida State's band. It's available here on Amazon.com."
1,Let Down,"The product description says that this suribachi includes the wooden pestle. I was only sent the bowl. I have looked around for one I can use but wooden ones are difficult to find, even in this culturally diverse city I live in. I feel it was false advertising or an inexcusable oversight. Bad business. The bowl is beautiful and I would love to be able to use it, so it is a big let down that I cannot."
2,Joshua and Iran,"This was a very interesting book. It is the first time that I have read one based on a Canadian. I enjoyed it, even though it was dry in a couple of spots."
1,wasted my money,"I bought these plastic blastgates because they were cheaper than aluminum. What a waste of money! I broke two of them while installing, the slots jam up with chips, and they cannot be taken apart for cleaning. As my funds allow, I will be replacing the plastic with aluminum."
2,"Good CD with a glimpse of the Civil War bit wamt ,pre","This CD book is well done for what it is. It will either make you hunger for more or, perhaps not. I enjoyed it very much and will now search more for additional ""books"" I am a vet with disabilities and my eyes are not adaquate for actual reading. The CD's are such a Blessing."
1,Just OK. May be worth skipping.,"See Lost in Translation first and Adaptation with Nicholas Cage. Sideways just didn't impress me much. It was cute, but not worthy of all the praise. Certainly a cliched artsy type ending. Oh brother, the drama of it. Oh for the sake of ""art""."
2,Plextor 8x DVD drives,"I had the Sony Dru 500 burner, had lots of trouble with un finished disks. Took it back and purchased the New Plextor 8x. Wow, what a difference, No more unfinished burns and I downloaded the firmware update and now my Plextor burns at 8x on any 4x +R disk I use. It's womderful! I went from almost an hour to burn a DVD to 8 minutes. I just purched the Plextor external drive too so now I have both. Both burn at 8x on any DVD+R media."
2,Blu-ray classic,"I loved this movie on standard DVD but the difference the High Def transfer makes is breath taking The blacks are ink blank, the sets and surroundings really pop out at you. A must have for high def customers"
2,roberts,I say they were a good value and price was a factor as in most anything else I buy these days.
1,It's nice but the wrong color.,"I needed a brown watchband, and it is definitely black! I kept it,it's nice, I didn't want the hastle of returning, but needed to purchase another brown watchband."
1,No Scientific Method Here,"If you want to read about an amalgam of theories that do not fit all the facts, this is your book. Besides, all the theories proposed by Clancy have been watched long ago by abduction researchers and all have been discarded. Although clancy claims that her work is scientific, there is no science in her book."
2,Credo Corn Cutter Really Does the Job,"I purchased this for hard to control calloused skin on the heels of my feet. man I finally found the right product. It works so good you have to be carefull not to slice away to much good skin.For follow up maintenace treatments you can use the detachable rasp file.Specific product that gets the specific job done,"
2,the movie is a waste of time,"the book is great. The author is so honest about his shortcomings, and that's why i hated the movie so much. The movie portrays him as a hero, takes way too many licenses, and ends up with a sports-movie-flavor. Too Hollywood for me. But the book is fascinating in an _Angela's Ashes_ sort of way"
1,Buyer Beware,"I put this product on my 4 chihauhau's and they experienced severe reactions. Two of them had severe itching, redness of their skin, and hair loss. I will never use any of these toxic flea repellents again. I will only use natural means of flea control. I implore you to read up on these products before applying them to your animals. It has taken almost 6 weeks for these symptoms to cease. The fleas themselves were not causing the problems that this product caused. I have researched and found a natural flea control from the cedarcidestore."
2,Newbies to Dir en Grey be warned,"I love Dir en Grey and adore this album, but I will tell you I had mininul exposure to their music when I heard this album and I was nearly scarred away from the band. After listening to it over and over (as well as hearing other singles), this album grew on me and I now love it.Those that are new to Dir en Grey SHOULD NOT listen to this album first. It is extremely dark, hardcore and can be a it disturbing. Though some may be able to handle it, it's best to listen to the Macrabe or Vulgar albums to get a better taste of their style first before sixUGLY.I still highly reccomend this album- especially if you're really upset and need mood music. This album's perfect. ^_^"
1,Nothing happend so far,"My wife is using this product more than one month but nothing happend so far.I think,i wasted my money."
1,Not a film but just text,"When I bought this I thought that it was a film made from de Sade's 120 Days of Sodom (which might have been amusing), but I was ***WRONG***. What it is was the text displayed on your screen. I checked and re-checked the web page carefully, but there was no hint of this.Since I already have it on my Kindle in both English (The 120 Days of Sodomwhich cost $2.99) and in French (120 journées de Sodome, Les (French Edition)which cost $0.00) I feel taken. If a DVD is just pages of text Amazon should tell you. But Caveat Emptor, even when dealing with Amazon."
1,Errors deadly in this context,"This book would have benefitted from a more thorough technical review. It's one thing to have typographical errors in a how-to book, but in this type of book it wastes the reader's valuable time. I'm glad I kept my receipt--this one is going back to the shelf."
1,Slow and reception cuts out,"This cell phone has numerous issues. Sometimes it won't shut off and it takes forever for the buttons to respond. I have received warranty replacement and it still does the same thing. Also, the reception is lousy and calls get dropped."
2,"Great Book, By Brilliant Combat Photog","This is a book that every photojournalist, press photographer, or combat cameraman should own. The works of Tim Page, not only highlight the personl hell that or soldiers msut endure in a time of war, but also those journalist who risk thier own lives in order bring home the story of our brave men and women who fight for their country."
1,Only lasted a couple of years.,"I used this regularly for tea and french-pressed coffee. Unfortunately after about 2 years, I went to descale it and found that the teflon lining sloughed off! It is useless now. Why do they have to coat the tank with non-stick? There is some debate as to whether that stuff is even hazardous to your health."
1,D-12 bring hip-hop to its knees with its new album,"D-12 continues in the venues of Eminem with their bangin' beats, flowin' rhymes, and touchy subjects. While not as polished as Eminem's earlier work in The Slim Shady LP and The Marshal Mather's LP, The Devil's Night contains the same bumping bass and harsh lyrics that made Eminem so famous. The album suffers a bit without Dr. Dre's genius at the boards but manages to convey the same raw emotion as Eminem's first two records. While not a classic, it should easily tide those Slim Shady lovers over until Eminem releases his own new album later next year."
1,"Great Show, Lousy Disk","I saw this show in Tampa, an unforgetable performance. Unfortunately as others have noted, the quality of this video is simply sub-par and nowhere near HD/BD quality. Save your money and catch them live before they get really old."
1,winestuff sippers,"I would rate the product I purchased on November 16, 2012 as Christmas gifts, but I have yet to recieve them. Contacted them three times, and each time they said they would be reshipped. Today is December 26, 2012 and I still do not have them."
2,Great Gift Idea,"This is a GREAT GIFT IDEA....or if you've always wanted to TRY one of Burt's Bees products, but didn't want to buy a whole bottle ""just in case you didn't like it""....Then this is a good way to TRY several of their GREAT items! Also a great way to have ""everything you need"" for a trip!"
1,Top collapses eachtimeyoutouch it,"Hardt to get to right height if yourimpared or older.than top crashes down if you go to move it?Had one mel on my lad. out with the trash,"
1,For power only,I bought this cable to replace a cable to a portable hard drive. The hard drive is a flash drive about the size of a pocket calculator. The portable hard drive would not boot up when connected with this cable. The green indicator light would come on but a window to access the files would never appear.
1,even I find it hard to believe,"Even with the events in Afganistan these past few years, I find the basic permise of this particular Tepper novel hard to buy. I don't think women are so stupid nor so weak as to let their lives be controled. Nor do I think that it requires aliens to show us the way, let alone when the author herself doesn't conclude the tale! I was greatly disappointed."
2,"Sexy, inventive fetish stories of all kinds","This beatifully set anthology features stories of all stripes - from girdles to spankings, colors to places to races to professions. Any and every fetish awaits you, with stories by powerful writers who make each page sizzle. Not every reader will actually indulge in every fetish here, but you can enjoy all of these wonderfully crafted, deliciously detailed stories by some wonderful writers, and on topics that are both accepted parts of the fetish world and novel takes on underappreciated kinks."
1,Feels cheap.,I just received this item today and was very surprised by the way the cotton feels. In a word - terrible. It feels very cheap like the sheets they'd use on hospital beds. I'm sending it back and forking over the extra money for something higher quality.
1,SACD hybrid surround buyers beware!,"fine cd! great music!get the remastered CD version. This is a warning, however, on the SACD version. It is a marginal surround hybrid mix and contains not a trace of bass in the subwoofer channel. all of the guitar comes from behind the listener. it's a pity this one couldn't have been done right.jeff probably has never heard the blasphemy of it all."
2,Compact but noisy,It's light and compact so good for small one bedroom apartment. It's noisy but many vacuums are. Don't have to buy filter bags just dump the dirt out of the built in canaster into plastic bags to throw out. It's dusty and messy to dump it so go outside to do it. Easy assembly.
2,Shiny little piece of utter audio flawlessness,"Put this disc in, sit back, put on some nice headphones, smoke something if you prefer, and get ready for 70 minutes of emotional epiphanies and cerebral riots. If you're willing, this disc can take you almost anywhere. I can only say the same of one other disc that I know of and that is ""Moon Safari"" by Air. If you don't buy this album, you have my pity. Oh yeah, go and see the movie ""The Matrix"", its just as good as this album and in many of the same ways"
2,Nancy Drew to the rescue!,"When I was growing up back in the 70's, Mom didn't allow us kids in the kitchen. As soon as I saw this cookbook and sawhow easy the recipes are, I was totally delighted. It also makes cooking from it a total delight because it brings backthe love I had for Nancy Drew. These are recipes that make me want to cook. And this book is not intimidating like thecookbooks I've purchased over the years. No buying weird spices that I will never use twice. Just simple, down to earth recipes.Thank you for this cookbook."
1,reprint,This book is a direct reprint from 1980. It was good then but much of it is out of date. Some of the sections in this one and the design one are the same. Having been in the trade for 27 years I found it useless.
2,Frankenstein by Mary Shelley,"A great story about Frankenstein!I found it very interesting and easy to understand. It kept my interest and I felt compassion for Frankenstein. He did not asked to be created by Victor, but Victor wanted to come up with a new creation to man-kind. Then after Victor created this monster, he finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. ""That is what got me hooked"" Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked. This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness. Thank you. Joe Reaves."
2,"Interesting ideas, mediocre thriller","The book served as an introduction, at least for me (and I am not very knowledgeable in this area, to the world of 'alternative' religion. I don't know how much of what was told in this book resembles any degree of truth. But it makes you wanting to read more on this subject. That's what I first started to do upon completion of this novel. And it's great achievment of the author. At the same time, I found it to be quite lame thriller, contrary to many reviews. The plot lines are predictable in many cases. In addition, Dan Brown is not a very good writer. His style is somewaht 'wooden' (as was mentioned in one of the reviews of this book). And what about all this itallics - I found such widespread use of itallics very annoying. That's why I gave it four stars. This book has a very interesting content, which is delivered in imperfect way."
1,Lousy Writing,"I was very interested in learning more about Porter Rockwell by reading a fictionalized biography, but as other reviewers have said, the writing is terrible. It is so bad that I never even got halfway through the book. I am afraid that although this writer is a historian, his skills with writing and dialogue leave a lot to be desired."
2,The Truth,"Finally, a book that tells the truth about the Bush administration. Enough hatred of Bush has been expressed. He may not be the best president we have ever had, but he is a damn good one, and deserves as much respect as any other president has had. Not even Moore could manipulate this book to make it full of lies, like he has done with everything else."
1,"Dreadful, and largely useless","Save yourself money and AVOID this ""guide"" at all costs. Its nothing more than a larger version of the instruction manual. Its pretentious on top of that; in the way that it makes you believe only the most cookie cutter character choices will be successful. The writer's idea of a walk through is a 3 line paragraph with a vague general description of what to do, if that. There are no maps that are of any use, the ones that are there, are postage stamp sized. Its full of useless filler information, and at times, reads like a huge advertisement for the game. Reading this guide and following its ""Teachings"" will result in severe idiocy. For instance, they believe Galka's should be restricted to melee fighters.. when in reality, once a Galka obtains his special equipment, he becomes one of the best mages in the game. Avoid this guide at all costs."
2,Exellence for sure.,"Sure to go down on record as an all time UB40 classic album. Fan of the band or not, you will really love this."
2,Exactly what I wanted,"I watched this as a kid, and its exactly how I remembered it. These DVDs are really hard to find. Since it is an older show the quality isn't HD but still good enough for my 2 yr old."
2,Great Reference Book,"Being new to computers and at an age when my memory is a little dull-I like having this book on hand for the basic questions. I apparently thought I was ordering the leopard edition when I must have been looking at the tiger reviews. I was disappointed in that but it still has information that I needed and it is presented in a way that makes learning this computer stuff not so scary to me. It helped me loosen up and I like the way Robin Williams leads me through practice runs so that I'm not just reading about it. The shipping from the seller I used was very slow and I will not order from them again, but the book itself was in good shape and the price was good. Thanks Amazon!"
2,Extemely Inspirational,"Life delivers some incredible obstacles. This story of 5 different women overcoming these obstacles through motivation and unique experience brought me inspiration and a new, positive perspective about myself. This video truly changed my life."
2,Top flight Indian devotional music,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to this excellent album. The singer and the musicians are gifted, highly trained, and passionate about their art. The vocalist's voice has to be heard to be believed. She has excellent voice control and expressivity. I have traveled extensively in India and I can tell you that it would be hard to find more consumate artists anywhere in the world.The music on Seeds of Prayer is fine for meditation, or as ambient music, but I believe it is best appreciated when attentively followed. Tune in to the devotional mood, the beautiful poetry, and the artistry of the performers. I think it will appeal to listeners of all ages. Soothing, inspiring, amazing, exciting, wonderful, spiritual music."
2,Botanica is a band,"It's easy to dismiss this band as a collection of hired guns. Paul Wallfisch spends time with Firewater, Kid Congo's been in plenty of bands, and Abby Travis has toured with Beck and KMFDM; however, this is no project thrown together during everybody's down time. It's a tight as hell, sad and groovey masterpiece. Botanica will apppeal to any fans of Nick Cave, The Tindersticks, or Scott Walker.Malediction is dark without being maudlin which is a tricky gambit to pull off. This is what the goth scene should be listening to: depression that sips cocktails and smirks at you instead of painting its face and hiding behind a wall of dyed black hair.This is the sound of style in New York."
2,Great book,Wonderful book if you want to know more about the practices of the samurai. I bought this for my boyfriend and he found it very useful.
2,A good return,"The first fantasy book I ever read was the Sword of Shannara. I owe Terry Brooks a great debt for contributing to the growth of an only childs imagination.This book is a return to the world of Shannara after Brooks spend many years writing the fantastic (7 stars) Word and the Void series. This book is the start of a trilogy (I'm guessing) and introduces a number of compelling characters. Expect a healthy dose of Highlanders, Elves, Dwarves, magic, and a new part of the Shannara world.A very fine return. Keep them coming, Terry!"
2,powerful teaching,Gary Thomas is a gifted writer and communicator who presents classic foundational truths in a fresh and understandable way. This book represents another work that will cause the reader to think past a stereotypical walk with Christ.
2,Good Movie. Not A classic.,"I do not know the books. But the movie is well made, It just lacks originality. You get the feeling you saw those things before. I suppose with so many movies around it is hard to be original. However, the movie does hold the viewer interest and has good entertainment value. I wish the fight scenes would have been toned-down to accommodate a wider range of audience."
1,Nah...,"I love TOP...but I don't love this CD. ""Diggin' on James Brown"" is an awesome song. But it's really the only good song on this CD. ""Souled Out"" is alright. But the rest of the songs aren't so good. I bought this CD and was disappointed."
2,ENJOYING THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF LIFE!,"THIS COMEBACK ALBUM AFTER FIVE YEARS OF ISOLATION, SHOWS A MORE MATURE LENNON, SINGING ABOUT HIS WIFE, HIS SON AND THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF LIFE. HIS LYRICS ARE, AS USUAL, PERSONAL, SIMPLE AND DIRECT. IF YOU THINK THAT HIS BEST YEARS ARE WAY BACK TO THE IMAGINE DAYS, THEN YOU'LL NOT ENJOY THIS ALBUM, BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE IMAGINE ALBUM. HERE YOU CAN HEAR A JOYFUL LENNON AS NEVER BEFORE: AWAY FROM POLITICS, AWAY FROM TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND AWAY FROM TRYING TO BE, WILLING OR NOT, A LEADER. MUSICALLY, JOHN, YOKO AND PRODUCER JACK DOUGLAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY SOLID BAND (TOP SESSION MEN). BUT AGAIN, HE WASN'T DOING ALL THE PROGRESSIVE ROCK HE MADE DURING HIS PLASTIC ONO BAND DAYS. HE RETURNED TO HIS MUSICAL ROOTS. IN JUST LIKE STARTING OVER, YOU GET A FEELING FROM THE 50'S. THIS IS A GOOD AND SOLID ALBUM, AND ALSO, A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO LIVED A VERY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP (BOTH ARTISTIC AND PERSONAL)."
2,The V-Tech babysitter,This is my 11 month old grand daughter's favorite toy. The buttons are easy for her to push. She can operate it without any help. Dances to the tunes and it occupies her for a long time. What more could you ask?
1,The shell that bombed,"There is no question that Uschi has the buxom figure and her misson of comparing the sex activities in Copenhagen to that of San Francisco could excite most male drives. For those who are expecting a lot, your expectations will most likely become mundane realizations. You know the type: If you have seen one you have seen them all."
1,good while it worked,"Pros: nice, easy to use, kids loved it, good soundCons: we bought two mp3s player (blue and pink)and one for a niece. All had died almost exactly after 1 yearIt was a good product and the kids loved it until it no longer turned on. We got our money back from Toys r Us"
2,Great kid's movie,My kids could be entertained for hours with this movie. They have watched it multiple times and still love it. It has a great storyline too.
2,A PRAXIS Masterpiece,I've been helping college students prepare for PRAXIS and NTE tests for years. This is simply the very best book available. The review is very clear and helpful. The practice tests are right on target. My students appreciate the extra help this book gives about becoming certified as a teacher and about finding a teaching position.I recommend this book to any students who will take a Praxis test.
2,"Bad title, good book!","This is an interesting look into the super secret world of special forces operators. This bok gives a peek inside the training and operations of special forces, and gives the reader an idea of what kind of men these warriors are. This is a great book. It is well written, to the point, and highly recommended."
2,woodrow,I like Woodrow and his style and specificity on topics he chooses to write on. Each element is written short sweet and right on target. In looking at various prophecy authors his stands out as informative and seems to follow scripture very well.
1,Avengers,What a let down! What a poorly written film! The whole team up of characters made a boring movie because the story was so lame. All the other Marvel films with one hero was written much better. Someone really dropped the ball.
2,Excellent little sucker!,"This is a great little vacuum! I needed something easy to get out everyday to pick up after 2 young kids, a cat & a dog- it picks up just about everything I need it too, including the pet hair & cheerios! It is very versatile, I use on hard wood, carpet in bedrooms, area rugs & even tile floors! The head is great to reach under & around furniture. So glad I found this so I don't have to drag out the big vac, broom & dust pan all around the house. I also really appreciate the bagless aspect, it is pretty easy to dump without throwing dust all around. The only draw back is the cord does seem a little short, but I suppose I can get an extension cord. It still beats the cordless vacs that you must have to keep charged- never worked for me."
2,Great Purchase!,This book is absolutely perfect for the Tennessee gardener! I am very happy with it. The color illustrations are very useful. And the chapter on the geological composition of Tennessee is fascinating. I love this book! I can't wait for next spring when I can add all of the native plant species to my garden.
2,profound teachings in a simple and short sutra,"Thay does it again... Wonderful deep teachings from the Buddha, made simple, clear, and easy to understand. Great teachings warning about dangers of fundamentalism and misunderstanding philosophy/religion, etc."
2,So far so good...,"I've wanted one of these for a long time. I originally bought a Cold Steel Trench Hawk, which is fully bad@$$. But I found the overall weight, just a bit heavy. I want something I can wield with speed and ease. So the lighter and more highly reviewed F01T Tactical Hawk appealed to me. I think the Tactical Hawk is def. more tactical than the Trench Hawk. But the Trench Hawk is better for chopping and similar tasks, although the Tactical Hawk boasts a 'hammer' pad. When I get a chance to throw the hawk and goof off with it some more, I'll update the review. I've marked only 4 stars because it's still a bit weighty, but that just means I need to bulk up. Also, I've yet to really field test it, but I anticipate it's gonna be awesome. This hawk is for home defense. I live in a rough area in an east coast city that is far worse than NYC and possibly Newark. Definitely glad to have this hawk nearby."
1,i don't get reasonable results,"We read the directions and practiced, but we are still getting weird results on our (wiggly) kid. Because we don't trust the results with this thermometer, we have to subject the kid to the other thermometer too... (it was a waste of money for us)."
2,Very good and informative book,"This book presents the various arrythmias in a very good format. From atrial to junctional rhythms, her explanations and diagrams are very helpful and informative.My only complaint, and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish she would have put some sort of cardiac pharmacology table in with the text (i.e. what drugs are indicated for the various dysrhythmias)."
2,very good,"I really like this CD. She has a very good voice and superb songwriting talent. I especially like Control... it's such a moving powerful song. The downside to this CD is that it makes me very sad when I listen to it. It makes me think about death more and I shouldn't be thinking about that stuff because I have a full life ahead of me. (I Hope) But if it didn't have the creepy, sad effect, it wouldn't be the great masterpiece that it is. This is truly a classic and shouldn't be overlooked. Check out Hello if you want another taste of Poe's talent without the dismal setting.Peace and love forever"
1,Sad...,"If only I could give this event 0 stars.. This, this isn''t ECW, and never will be ECW.Hardcore Homecoming? This is the most blatant false advertising since the neverending story. This event as about as hardcoreas mash potatos night at the old folks home..so many flaws, so little time..Kid Kash hugging Hat Guy on his way to the ring, then picking a fight with him several minutes later.Joey Styles, and don''t get me wrong.. Joey is the man, he recycled a line, and used it on ONS. (See FBI entrance on ONS, and HH)And the thing that bugged me the most, all the editing.. I wasn't sure if I was watching Forever Hardcore, or Hardcore Homecoming.I won''t comment too much on the shape of the wrestlers there out of respect for what they did for the once great company of ECW.. But when Danny Doring is the most in shape guy there, you got some problems..Guys, and gals.. you want to seesome classic ECW please, I beg you.. either them buy them here, or go to your local video store."
2,Yello Is Still Going,"This album is a great thing to own. Out of 11 tracks, I only found about 3 tracks that I hardly listen too. Thealbum is balanced, so ifthre is a dull track, it i followed by a great track. I'm a Yello fan and I will say this is a great piece, in the Yello story."
2,Great choice,"Lightweight and the ease of the trigger is so easy it surprises you every time. Great features with nozzle cutter, ladder hanger and clean out."
2,Should Have Read it in High School,"I found this book to be ponderous and quite a bit less than the thriller it is touted to be. Although it was apparent the entire saga was going to take place in short period of time, I was never drawn to the ""Oh my gosh, they better hurry!"" that I'm sure was intended. The ending was somewhat anticlimatic, and the processess kind of outdated. I don't know: Maybe I should have read it when it came out and I was in High School... Definitely not Chrichton at his best."
1,Be Prepared To Be Scared Silly!,"Sure this phone is a very cute little phone. It has pretty colors, and kept my young child busy for a couple of hours. Lets get down to the real business folks...this phone rang off its hook about a month into owning it. As strange as this may seem...it scared us silly at night for a week straight! I literally threw it against a wall on the 3rd night, but that didn't stop it from ringing the following night. (This is why I gave this toy 5 stars in the durability section.) I would not recommend purchasing this toy for yourself, but perhaps for someone you wish to scare the silly out of!"
2,Good,these are some great speakers. They have very good quality. That is why I gave them a 4 star rating.
1,DVD Quality,"I watched this movie about 15 yrs. ago and was so excited that Amazon had it available. The only bad thing is that the DVD's quality is horrible! And this is suppose to be a remastered edition? I paid the extra money because I thought it would be digitally enhanced / dolby digital, etc.........It looks like someone was watching this movie on their own TV and they recorded it with a video camera. I love Amazon but I have noticed a lot of unhappy customers with this one."
2,Almost the same as always,I've always like 501s but I'm thinking that Levi has cut corners/costs and gone to a lighter weight fabric so they wear out faster.
2,Delivery,Delivery was very slow but I found the customer service good in answering my questions concerning the arrival.
2,Ready for next installment,I hope Ms. Veryan is an author who checks out these reviews because I really want her to make Minerva a main character in an upcoming book.
1,Not Pierce's best,"I've read and loved all Pierce's books, but this series reads like it was a struggle to write. Too much plot without action, too many names and characters, unconvincing characterization, and severe moral ambiguity. Difficult to really get behind a spy hero in this day and age, particularly one orchestrating a revolution that kills innocents. If you're new to Pierce, try another series first. My favourites are Protector of the Small and Circle of Magic."
2,Introduction to ICU,"I found this book via their website... after reading a few of their online files that are available for free I opted to purchase this in the book form as it was an enjoyable, informative read and I wanted to support the author.This info is a great resource and fun to read. I really like its grassroots and truly appreciate the efforts the author has placed in compiling and updating this book.I recommend it to anyone entering the ICU, somewhat new in the ICU or students aspiring to enter the ICU."
2,I got my course book!,"I finally got my replacement book, and it turned out the FEDEX did find the first book that was lost in the carriers hands, and I had it shipped back to Amazon.com directly.Thanks!Business is great.Damien"
2,Broken Bow a MUST for Star Trek fans,"This book is basically the pilot novelized, with just a bit more. As usual, it doesn't wander too much from what was on TV, but it adds enough to be a great read for fans! From attitudes towards the Vulcans to 'insider' information on the origins of Star Fleet, this bring enough to the table to be a great book! If you're a fan of Star Trek, or just beginning with Enterprise on UPN, this is worth the price of a hard cover book! Highly Recommended!!"
1,A reality tv show with artistic pretensions,"I guess it's hard work to elicit meaningful insights. So instead, this filmmaker features numerous nonsensical choreographed segments of her documentary subjects dancing around with each other in their wrecked-up old town. I guess this is supposed to show lyricism in an underprivileged milieu, but really, it was just silly and boring. And the rest of the footage seemed curiously unfocused and superficial. A detailed examination of the life circumstances and problems of this community would have been interesting, but this film was more like a reality tv show with artistic pretensions."
2,Best Booster Seat Our There!,"I have 3 children ages 6, 5 and 3 and they all use one of these seats. I thought by now my older kids would have outgrown them but they are on the small side and still need the extra height to sit comfortably at the kitchen table.All 3 seats are still in fantastic shape. The oldest one I have is 4 years old and the newest one is 6 months old and you can't really tell the difference between them. They hold up real well and are easy to keep clean.They adhere well to any seat in my house from kitchen to dining room. No slipping at all.I highly recommend this booster seat. Yes it is pricey but it lasts forever as I can attest too."
1,No begining! No ending! No good!,Way below expectations. Go ahead and rent the movie but do not buy it!Waste of money!
1,why do these people even pretend like they can sing,"Hilary Duff isn't that great of a singer. Apparently she thought since everyone's world revolved around her acting that everyone's world would revolve around her singing too. Guess what! No! This song might have been decent but she and her sister killed it for all eternity. Speaking of sisters, mine won't stop playing this song over and over and i""m so sick of it! I never liked it and never will! Hilary is perhaps the worst musical artist around today, and that's saying something because there are loads of terrible artists today (for example: pretty much all rap). Never buy this single. Heck, don't even look at it. Don't be aware of its existence. Move out of the country and start a new life. This single is awful! So awful!"
2,In Eddie's Name: A Moving and Thought-Provoking Journey,"The true story of a senseless act of violence and its heart-breaking aftermath, ""In Eddie's Name"" is uniquely powerful in its ability to simultaneously awaken in the reader two strongly opposing forces usually found to be mutually exclusive: angry, moral indignation and then, understanding and forgiveness.Told in a clear, concise, evenly journalistic manner, it is a story that grips you from the outset and propels you along a path of horror, loss and injustice that few have traveled with such dignity and grace as do the book's quietly heroic protagonists, the Polec family of Philadelphia.Galvanized as I was, I read the book in one compelling evening and would recommend it without reservation to anyone who wonders whatever became of civility and the justice that was the inherent promise of the American social experience."
1,Crichton loses his mind,"Once I finally reached the end of this painful experience I was distraught that I was stuck on a subway and there were no garbage cans to donate this worthless piece of high school action to. I honestly feel less intelligent after the experience and refuse to think that just because Crichton has written good books before that it somehow is a natural talent. The characters were unbelievable. The scenarios seemed to be from a Monty Python flick. The thrills and suspense are ridiculous. Please let someone else warn you before you waste your money. Use it to donate to abandoned animals instead.I honestly do not understand how professional reviewers are rating this so high. You'll notice that they are usually only quoting from the first 20 pages of this book, which shows how much they care about reading this nonsense."
2,excellent movie,Superb acting and adaptation from the Book. It is a pleasure to have this as part of my library of greal films. Karl Wohinc
1,Amateurish and Naive,"These writers, Buchanan and Wallace have written a superficial and impractical resource. It's as though they decided to get published and sat down in their living room, dug out some old school papers, ripped off other idea people, and pieced together something overnight with out any real thought or experiement. Once in a great while I am astonished, given the amount of good work that gets submitted to publishers, to find cr*p like this sqeak through. I can only asume that the writers knew someone or are related to someone. Don't bother wasting your money on this garbage like I did."
1,Not compatible with Vista basic,"While I was trying to install the various features a window popped up and said that this cordless desktop was not ""completely"" compatible with Vista. It wanted me to download the newest version of Yahoo ??????? What does Yahoo have to do with it ??? I can only get 4 of the features to work. The green light on top of the mouse went out right away. Don't know if it's supposed to or not. Am thinking of sending it back but love the tilting scroll button. Just got it Monday and am an experienced user. Have used Logitech products for many hears and never had a problem with them."
1,DO NOT BUY PNY!!!,"Stay away from PNY products! I bought a PNY Attach Flash Drive a few months ago, and not only is it poorly manufactured (flimsy plastic case, very loose fitting, cheap looking...), but they do not honor their rebate offers! Stay away!"
1,Civilization IV - don't buy it,"Civ III was superior in every respect to Civ IV. Gameplay in IV is mind-numbingly slow, and the emphasis on 3D rendering just detracts from the game (it's Civ, not Age of Empires!). I will be returning it for as much of a refund as I can manage.This game installed and worked perfectly on my computer, but I was still hugely disappointed. The high standards that have guided the Civ franchise until now have been abandoned."
2,"A Must read, enjoyable, thought provoking story.","In a highly readable, moving and sincere manner, Jennie's Reprisal proceeds to thread together many New Age beliefs into this charming, romantic novel. If conventional explanations of life don't make any sense to you any more, the idea of Jennie's spirit/essence reincarnating over many lifetimes to reach her ultimate destiny just might. An enjoyhable, well written, thought provoking, must read story."
2,Nice grater but small,It has become so hard to find a good quality hand held grater. I love the handle on this one. It a nice rubber and big enough to grip easily even with wet hands. The overall size and the size of the holes were smaller than I expected. So it is best for very hard cheeses like parmesan or for zesting.
1,just a quiky,"hipzip is probably the best mp3 player there is out ther right now, but looking into the utilities of this device, i see no difference between the hipzip and a cd player besides the no moving parts and the size, besides you still have to change disks too. if you really want heavy music playing time i suggest you go for a mp3 jukebox such as the nomad one which stores 6b, or some others. buy the hipzip or in fact any other mp3 players cuze you think cd's are a bit too big, but thats about it."
2,Great Book,I thought that this book was greate and i dont even like to read as a matter of fact when the teacher said we where going to read this book all that went thrugh my head was boring but when i started reading it it was pretty good well at least i liked it.
2,Vice City is sure to be a great game,I really like the Grand Theft Auto series and so far every GTA game has been superb. This one I imagine will be better than my current favorite GTA3. This one will take place in the 1980's and have some famous Hollywood personalities. The new movements you can use with your character is a great feature. I am sure this game will be excellent like the other GTA's.
1,34 X 29 is baggy!,"The 34 X 29 Lee jean is enormous - the seat is huge - the thighs are huge - so, if you're a big guy these jeans are made for you. If you're a skinny guy, save your money."
2,It works,"I took Magnesium Taurate for its great bioavailability. When I was pregnant, I had to increase my douse to prevent leg cramps and suspect it helped keep my preeclampsia to manageable levels until my baby was far enough along to be delivered safely. Mag Tar doesn't upset my stomach or mess up my digestive tract even at doses of 500mg daily. Most people are magnesium deficient and this is an effective way to supplement."
2,The greatest band fo the 70's,"I heard Bloodrock 3 when i was 15 nearly 40 years ago. And for me it did'nt loose it's freshness. Texas Rocks! And now on a CD it is even better, because my 33rpm was a bit worn out. They have reedited it so now it is a less rare. I have been looking for it a long time and it was expensive when i bought it. And i suggest you get all of their CDs. This band did not have a long life, but a very creative one. From the Bloodrock ""Bloodrock"" to ""2"", ""3"", ""USA"", ""Passages"", and ""Stilled by Whirlwind Tongues"", they went trough many phases and personnel changes, but the creativity and talent was always good and new! At the top of my list with Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, Grand Funk Railroad, Rainbow, Bad Company, Golden Earring, Cream. Well... i am sure if you love those bands you will love Bloodrock! Also you can listen [...] thank you!"
1,A rip of Limp Bizkit,"The new Vanilla Ice is trying to be like Korn and Limp Bizkit , only he's ripping off their music . After I listened to this album , it was so terrible , it was not even close as being good as Vanilla Ice's previous album Mind Blowin . Too bad."
2,A MUST HAVE for Nursery start ups,Gotta say the author gives a realistic picture of starting a nursery business. By the time you finish this you will have a clear picture of the business basics. If you are looking for a book on how to grow plants look elsewhere - this is a practicle guide to starting the business. Includes the Web address for additional info.EXACTLY the information I needed!
1,Rebecca Ryan,"The choice in tunes is fanatastic but Rebecca Ryan hardly does them justice. The emotion is watered down, her voice sounds like a parody of Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to Mr. President though a nice novelty but song after song in this style becomes old and annoying. The piano playing deserves 4 stars but unfortunately you are distracted by the the weak whispy voice that lingers much like a mosquito in ones ear. This cd left me craving the talent of Keely Smith, Dinah Shore and Julie London, who are the strong voices usually associated with these great torch songs. Your money is better spent with the originals."
1,what has literature become?,"This novel was appauling. If you like to read about heroines who promote and perform abortion, and who run away with their lover while pregnant with their husband's baby, then maybe this is the novel for you. For me, however, I find no redeaming value in that!I could almost handle that story line if Ella had a change of heart, or if it were a tragedy and we see that Ella made some mistakes...but none of that, just a sense of well, this is what she wanted so it must be the best thing. Ella is tunred completely inward on herself and while she claims to have some guilt for her actions, it's obviously not enough."
2,If you like laughs you must see this movie.,This was an excellent movie. One of Chris Tucker's best movie's yet. Jackie Chan's also. The movie was funny from beginning to end. I'd watch this movie over and over again. If you haven't seen this movie you must see it. It'll have you crying from laughing so hard.
1,Great Info but hard to follow,"The information in the book is worth 10 times the price. Stuff i never saw in 6 years of TKD. But i had to watch the video to get what the pictures were trying to show. The pictures in the book are really poorly done. Get the video, if you like it and want more then get the book."
1,Pure Propaganda,"I am one of the people shown in this video.Before you buy it, I strongly suggest that you find my Bible codes web page and read the long critique of this video that appears there.You will find that the video got many basic facts wrong, and did not have any of the ""balance"" that it so proudly proclaims.If you still want to buy it after that, go ahead."
2,'The Engager' - works good,Our company had some trailers that had dead batteries in the 'break-away' systems. Instead of just replacing batteries - (which were quite expensive) I decided to replace the whole system. Found the 'Hopkins Engager' at Amazon. It was cheaper than a battery for our existing systems and came with a switch and everything else new. It was easy to install and it works good. I really like the battery meter that tells if your charge circuit is working on the pull vehicle. Good product
2,Surprise Your Friends with Highway Trivia!,"Clearly this topic will not be of interest to everybody but for those with an interest in history and the often surprising reasons behind the highway system in the U.S., this book is a joy. You will astound your friends with trivia! How many of them know that Maryland contains the most-expensive (per toll mile) interstate in the Country? (How many of your friends might care, is another story).Altough it seems to be written in high-school textbook prose, the chapters are well organzined, the photos are wonderful and the format lends itself to the coffee table. It can be read in almost any order, a chapter at at time or even a sidebar at a time.I now have an appreciation for the engineering marvel that Americans take for granted every day."
2,Loved It!,This novel is a hoot. Has a certain segment of Southern Society nailed oh so correctly! Gonna buy more of his works.
1,Lousy transfer/ Worn copies,"It's incredible that in february 2004 you get a DVD release that has the sound and video quality of an old betamax tape. The releasers used the most worn copies that they could found.They are filled of scratches and splices. They are dark, grainy and the sound quality is awful.This is a lack of respect to the consumer and to ""One Step Beyond""On my opinion, don't buy the complete set. Get one single and if you consider that the quality is enough, then get the rest.It's easier to dispose away one DVD than twelve.If what you want is to have the collection because of it's historical interest, then don't listen to me, but I'm complaining because actually I'm watching ""on air"" (on saturday nights) some copies that have full quality; but I'm unable to get them. So, there are still good copies from where the releasers can make a good quality DVD transfer."
1,"Queit, but not worth the money","Well, it seems as though this is just a dud of a product. It run non stop. it constantly spins and as a result my cat doesnt want to use it uless its unplugged. It would make a much more useful product if it only ran after the cat went in, like my old one I had which was great. Also, by the end of the first day, it was still pretty quiet but the motor began making noise. Additionally, it cleans so slow, that I really may as well just do it myself. At any rate, I wish I could return this worthless piece of S. I will most likely bite the bullet on this one and end up getting another one of the old kind that I had."
1,All-Clad Stainless Steamer with Lid,"I was disappointed with this product because of the quantity of food that it accomodates. Steam holes do not cover the entire bottom of this steamer and food may scorch when not placed directly over the steam holes. Food can only be placed toward the bottom center of the steamer over the steam holes to prevent scorching. I have another stainless steamer that I prefer because steam holes cover the entire bottom of the steamer. However, this steamer is o.k. for steaming a smaller amount of food where all of the food fits over the steam holes in the center bottom of the steamer."
1,cant give a review,"i cant give a review, because i have not recieved it yet. it is now been over a month since i ordered it"
2,large enclosed cat littler pan,Already have 4 but couldn't find another in my town. Was surprised and happy to learn that price including shipping was even less than I had paid for one of the units previously! This is a great litter box which helps keep the smell and the mess of cat litter to a minimum AND my cats use it!
1,Not for True Fans of Charles Fort,I only gave this book one star because of I couldn't give it a 0 as a fan of Charles Fort and proud owner of all his books I decided to check this series out page one was ok but on page two I ended up shaking my head when they said he was a librarian page three i was sick to my stomach and by page four I was telling everybody in my family the flaws and I gave up on page seven I know this is suppose to be fiction but the author of this took a wonderful man with a quiet life who only wanted to tell the world that nothing is what it seems and made him into a wannabee superhero I bet you Charles Fort is turning in his grave at this very incorrect picture of him and what he did but if your into fantasy and is not a big fan of Charles Fort then this is the book for you
2,Pretty Good,"I'm new to juicing; I bought a juicer first, because it tastes good and second, because it's probably somewhat good for me. I was hard pressed to find a juicing book that didn't preach about how juicing can save the world etc. And once you get past the corny names, this book did a pretty decent job of providing a novice with some exploration ideas if I start to get adventurous. I like that she didn't shy away from suggesting adding sugar to some drinks, it showed me that, like me, she was in it for taste first and health second."
1,Huge Disppointment,The medicine ball came in flat and dirty. Box was torn. I returned it and it ended up costing me shipping charges as Amazon would cover their rate of shipping costs so I had to pay the differences.
1,Not worth your money,"The Sony component cables are $19.99 and cover you under their warranty, and are of the same quality as these monster cables (or as any other component cable). Don't waste your money.(also, don't be a moron and tell sony you are using 3rd party cables)"
2,"He wasn't getting upset, though...","..he was only proving a point. You have no right to bash other people's favorite musicians, especially dead ones.Oh wait, I forgot, bashing dead musicians is COOL...."
1,Not worthy,This book is not worthy of the Patricia Cornwell I've read in the past. I kept falling asleep while I was reading it. The characters were confusing and superficial. I'm very disappointed.
2,Abe Lincoln,"Historical account of Abraham Lincoln's early life. Inspiring speech at the presidential debates. Good filming, and dialogue. Raymond Massey plays Lincoln very well."
2,A must read for Cubamaniacs...,"I bought this book and read it 5 days after getting back from Cuba. I came back with an understanding of the events of the Revolution but felt completely disconnected emmotionally from what I learned. I'm greateful for this book.The sense of loss and pain that Mr. Eire conveys in the book helped me to understand the destruction and changes that occured during 1959 on the personal level. So often, we see historical events as just events that happened. Many books have been written about the revolution and what happened. But reading this book attached the emmotions and feelings that a young boy was forced to experience at far too young an age."
1,Kidoozie,"Compre este juguete por tan buenas revisiones que tenia, pero dejenme decirles que este juguete no es para nada divertido. Solo es apretar hacia abajo y el gusano correo, pero mas alla de la propiedad causa y efecto no van a encontrar en este juguete. Lo unico que no se puede negar es la durabilidad."
1,I ordered a hardcover book and got soft cover.,"When you click on hardcover, it should be that simple. You have it in hardcover or you don't. I buy these for my wife because she likes this series. I prefer to buy on ebay because it is so much easier than Amazon. I do buy from Amazon and am satisfied with the last two purchases, but it is harder to by on you. Now I have to go through the return process which I hate to do, or just keep this small print soft cover and avoid ordering anymore from you. Thanks Gary Weber"
1,Bad DVD,I love this movie and bought it for my god-daughter and friends son both three years old.. We were watching the movie when it skipped ahead to the middle of the movie!!! It was a used copy so I thought to clean it and try again then it skipped again and again!!! I was soo upset such a waste of money I will never buy from them again!!!
2,Informative and amusing,"So, this is how the other half lives? A highly enjoyable read. If I should ever win the lottery I shall remember this book!"
2,Body Glove Rythm Horizontal Case for Smartphones,"I bought this for my husband as his old case - a pass down from our son- finally gave out.He has a pay as you go phone and this works perfectly for that.The case has never once opened so his phone dropped. He had tried several cases and they either came offentirely, or the phone came out and he would lose it.Now, he just has to remember to put in on once in the morning and he, nor I, worry about him losingthe phone. Good product, and so glad we found it at Amazon. It has saved us money as well as headaches.Body Glove Rythm Horizontal Case for Smartphones is the product we bought."
2,A good collection projects for a beginner to intermediate wood worker.,My wife gave me this book as a surprise gift. I generally agree with most of the other reviews concerning the scope and complexity of the projects in this book. There are a lot of projects and not too many are difficult for an advanced beginner. Most of the projects can be completed with only hand tools. Several projects do require a lathe.I really would like to give this book 4.5 stars... :)
1,Frustrated,"I purchased one on the recommendation of my sister, who has one. (Our dog has serious front door issues!) When it arrived, the battery screw would not fit no matter what we did. So I returned it and ordered another one. This one worked ... FOR TWO HOURS. Two zaps (on the lowest setting) and it completely died. I must say, it did work as far as getting our dog's attention and stopping the ""door rage,"" but now it is completely dead and I'm done with it. I will try another manufacturer. (Other reviewers seem to have the same problem, I should have listened to my gut!)"
2,"Great bars, bad price!","I like the Luna bars. Lighter-weight and more vitamins than the original clif bars. Most of the flavors I have tried taste great; some are too sweet for me. I like that they are a healthier alternative to granola bars that are made with corn syrup and deficient in vitamins.Amazon is not the place to buy these, though! You should never be paying more than $1.00 per bar. Trader Joe's is a great place to get these (and normal clif bars ($.99))."
2,Pretty & functional,Moved into a kitchen with copper accents and this works just fine while looking nice. Holds all of my major cooking utensils.
1,Badly produced DVD,"I agree with the guy below about the picture quality. I liked this movie, but once I started noticing (about five minutes into it) the terrible compression, I couldn't keep my eyes off it. For those who aren't sure what that means, picture this: large chunks of the screen will freeze for a second or two. It's the only DVD I own that's done this badly. Why spend $20 to own a movie if it's going to look lousy?"
2,Excellent,Excellent book for those students that speak spanish and are learning how to speak brazilian Portuguese!
2,What a great book!,"This is the first Penn and Teller book that I have read, and it was awesome. It was very funny. The tricks were really cool (it's amazing what people will believe), and Penn's social commentary was insightful. This book was fun to read, I highly reccomend it."
2,WHAT A GREAT SERIES,"AS l read the five books in this series ""Abram's Daughters"", each book stood on its own. I lost sleep trying to finish one book so I could start the next one. What a wonderful message that is in this series. NEVER LOSE HOPE."
1,poor remake,"An original movie classic trying to be updated but falling far short. The flying ships belong in a comedy and they turned this classic into a ship of fools instead of adding more clearity and better film coverage. Amazon is as always great, but this movie was a flop."
2,Move Over David Foster Wallace,"These fictions are wicked, funny, intelligent, moving, unashamed, and original. The stories weave in and out of capitalism and the bodies of those written over by the movements of culture. Wives, junkies, prostitutes, gay men, male movies stars stuck in the roles we won't let them leave, terrorists, athletes, models, icons, mutants and average joes all populate the underworld of LIBERTY'S EXCESS. Get this book. In this new author we've got a live one on our hands."
2,LOVED IT,"This book was so good! It's been a while since I last read it, but It is worth buying. To the author: As a Christian teenage girl, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing a wonderful romance for me to read."
1,Isle of Dogs,"This book is terrible. In fact, I would like my money back on this one. I had always looked forward to Patricia Cornwell's latest Kay Scarpetta book, and eagerly bought this title, much to my disappointment. I think that the story is trite, that the characterizations are inept and what is this talking backwards business - give me a break. Next time I'll get a copy of Ms. Cornwell's book from the library before buying!"
2,Loved this movie,"Went to see this movie in the theater with my husband and eighteen year old son. Amazing when all three of us like the same movie. Definitely a romantic comedy, but had enough good music and humor to keep even the 18 year old's interest. Probably helped that he was heading to Ireland a few months after this. I strongly recommend this movie. It's the type you can watch over and over and the music is great. If I remeber correctly, the soundtrack doesn't include my favorite songs from the wake and the Irish pub scenes. Would love to find a cd with those on it."
2,Absolutely flawless,A magnificent and wholly believable performance by Russel Crowe. You;d almost want to pick up a gladius and follow him yourself!
2,Small and effective,"Chose this one because it was the smallest physical size of the adjustable ones in 25 watts. Bought this for a 2 gal nano tank but have since upsized to a 7 gal horizontal tank. Seems that the heater is transitioning well to the larger size. It wasn't working so well in the vertical position for the larger tank, but now it's placed horizontally just above the substrate and the temp has gone up 10 degrees in under 24 hrs. I'm surprized it's heating the whole tank. Haven't had it very long, so can't speak to longevity but so far, so good!"
1,Does not work well,"While the idea of this toy is great, the implementation does not work. The subs shoot off in wild directions rather than going straight. The rubber band you use to fling it sticks out of the front of the sub & causes it to turn rapidly depending on how it sits after releasing it. We could never get them to go straight. just quick circles. The target was useless because of this."
2,Great Music From The 80's,"I was in Toronto Canada for Canada Day on July 1st and got to see Red Rider perform several songs live from this CD and they were GREAT ! Being from the USA I had never heard them before, but they put on the best show. Ken Greer's guitar playing was awesome and Tom Cochran has a great sound as the lead vocals. This CD is well worth the 5 stars I gave it. I bought it, listened to it, and recommend it all the way."
2,"awesome product for dry, curly, or over-processed hair","my hair had been over-chemically processed-( professional colr and japanese relaxers) for years. It was dried out and i simply wanted to grow my own hair back. This product lasts a good long time. I use it in 3 ways. By the directions on the bottle. or, when i'm blow-drying (or t-3 flat- ironing) I add a touch to my ends. This adds shine and decreases breakage during styling.My hair is curly -so, I can also leave a quarter sized amount in when air drying my curls for added shine and decreased frizz. My natural hair has grown back nicely after one year of using this product."
2,Hot Nosieless Finder pickups,The pickup are great. I added them to my Strat with TBX pods and a 500k vol pod. The only problem I have was with Amazon. They sent me the wrong color pickups. I need to get the pickups into my Strat ASAP and didn't have time to mail them and wait. Buy your pickups from a store if the case color is important to you. Standard Stat covers will not cover the Nosieless Hot pickups.
1,Piece of CRAP,"Short and sweet, this TV is crap.Serious geometry problems, grainy picture. Check out more on the avsforum. If you do buy it, buy it locally and NOT from amazon so you can return it."
2,Blu Ray is a scam,"PS3 is well built, it has all the latest connections, runs very quiet, and lack of a DVD tray is a nice touch.What I find annoying is having to constantly confirm when trying to exit the internet or stopping a game, having to turn on the unit to recharge the controller. The internet browser is very weak. And some website that require plug-ins, forget it, it won't work, like flash, activex, adobe acrobat, etc. Sony should not advertise this as internet capable unless it can browse all sites.[...].So you get a great picture with 10 year old Dolby Digital soundtracks.I bought this for games, so I am relatively happy with it."
2,My toes are warm & toasty !,"A very nice quality slipper at a low price. It's real shearling & it has a rubber sole for taking the trash out or runningnext door to your neighbors. It's freezing out, & I have tile floors, these babies sure help! In fact my husband tries to squeezehis big feet into them; I told him to get his own. Why not treat your cold feet too?"
1,I got screwed,"I ordered book Dictionary of Popular Yiddish Words and Phrases and Proverbs a thick book described as fairly new and I got an old pocket book with a stinky yellowish pages probably remembering my grandfather. The title was A Dictionary of Yiddish Slang & Idioms.So, I assume it was a typical trick some people use to stick somebody else with some crop.The seller sent me email asking for recommendation and I described to him how I feel about this transaction - never heard from him since. Typical for some."
2,Speedy value,"If you understand the IDE lingo of master, slave and cable select then you probably won't need the documentation provided. If you don't know what these terms mean, then the documentation will not be useful to you anyway. That being said, this drive worked right out of the box, burns just as quickly as advertised and is quiet. I'm quite happy with my purchase."
1,too much crashs with web-oriented applications,"It has a good speed in terms of price, but it is not reliable system and just too much crashes...and display(it is bright but not clear) isn't so good compared to other brands..."
2,New Jersey Does It Again,"Pacewon steps up front with extensive solo effort. More for your money is more suitable. In the tradition of previous Outsidaz releases (i.e. The Bricks and Nightlife EP), Pacewon accents, emphasize, and execute wordplay lovely. His imagination is worthy of classic noteriety boasting lines such as ""I don't be battling average men, I rip your establishment"". The beats remain fresh and complimentary to his lyrics. Features guest appearances from Wyclef Jean, Korupt, Rah Digga, Young Zee, and of corse the Outsidaz. Also contains the hit video ""I Declare War"" on second disc. Pacewon is definetly worthy of investment."
2,A good end to a great trilogy,"This book was very enjoyable, the first being Lord Valentines Castle (A masterpiece), the second Majipoor Chronicles (A dissapointing compilation of short stories), and finally Valentine Pontifex, which was more in the ilk of the first in the series. The book was well written and held my interest from start to finish. My only minor criticism being that some of the earlier characters, whilst present were not explored further or made much use of in this the final rendition. Still a great book and worth a read."
1,"Not a bad toy, but this is a scam.","This is a descent toy, our one year old has it and loves playing with it. However the seller is running a scam, this and most of the other toys they are selling are list at 4x the retail price and easily available at many retailers or other online vendors."
2,Great Little TV!,This LCD TV does a great job in a small space. The tuner works well (using coaxial cable connection) and the sound is much better than expected. The battery holds a charge for several hours. Very nice overall!
1,Great Music Poorly Performed,"When I saw this cd, I immediately bought it; my goal being to understand the Creston Sonata better, as well as listen to an actual classical baritone sax solo. However, when I started listening, I found myself doing double takes...could a professionally recorded player really be missing notes?? Turns out this was the case...what a shame...This occurs on several tracks of the cd. Though the blips aren't by any means obtrusive, they're by no means hard to find...His stylings are a little unorthodox for some of the pieces, but all-in-all not terrible. I will say that the way he and the pianist handle the last several bars of the 2nd movement of the Creston is one of the best I've heard...it's perhaps the only recording I've heard to make sense of it.All in all, if you're looking for recordings of these pieces, I'd personally look elsewhere...but that's just me..."
2,Applying the book to your everyday life!!,This was such a delightf bookt read because I was so moved by Morrie. I think everyone has one time or another had a teacher guide them as Morrie did. All the wise things Morrie had to say can apply o everyone. I think this can open your eyes to see how you live your life. This gave me a new perspecetive on life and what I need to improve.
2,Good...But Could Use More,"I enjoy the soundtrack a lot, although much of the music in the movie is not on the soundtrack (most notably Summer Wind, This Town, and Beyond the Sea). Otherwise, it's very enjoyable. My personal favorite is Matchstick Men and Weird is Good (a little odd, but good). With the exception of some essential tracks missing, it's overall good."
1,Without the laugh track...,"you wouldn't know it was supposed to be funny.Tired, recycled cliche's jokes and characters abound."
2,Perfect,"About a week before the chorus I was a part of was to perform portions of the Messiah for Palm Sunday, one of the directors informs us that we are to wear a black bow tie. I heard from others in the chorus that they drove all over town and couldn't find a bow tie. No surprise, I mean, who wears these things anymore? Unless you're getting one with a tux, a standalone bow tie isn't something you're gonna find at Walmart. So this was helpful because the bow tie was just what I needed, and I needed it in short notice and it came very quickly. Also it was cheap, and it wouldn't be nice to pay a lot for something I needed once. It was also very easy to put on; I'm a person that needs to look at a series of diagrams every time I need to tie a normal tie, so anyone can use this product.The only con is that when you buy it Amazon will recommend Child Abraham Lincoln costumes and Black Plastic Canes, and of course more bow ties, as if you needed more than one, when you go to the main page."
2,Must have!,"I really do not know where to start:) I saw the movie for this soundtrack on late night cable years ago, and have watched it every time I've had the chance since. Great Movie and the music just accented the film so well it was truly amazing. I bought the soundtrack off ebay and its just an amazing collection of songs from an artist I had not heard of until I had seen the movie. Young, old, whatever this is a must get CD. If you dont buy the CD at least got the song ""Dream a little dream of me"", which is the best song on the album:)"
1,Not as good as the first one,"I am quite disappointed with this latest offering from Tad. I have read all of his other books, and this one is nearly bereft of action and cohesion. The book is one long, disconnected and chaotic chase scene. The kaledescopic change of perspective is prohibitive to getting involved with the plot. The few strong characters, Renie, Xabbu and Gardiner stumble and tumble helter skelter through the ether, struggling to remember what their original goal was entering the Otherworld. I have to admit I will pause before purchasing the third for $25. Money spent better on worthier tomes..."
1,Easiest way I've found to make my feet bleed in a painless fashion.,"I've used standards single edge razor blades for years to keep my corns at bay, once you get used to the method it works well and gives you the control you need to shave off what you need to and not cut yourself.That's where this item has the issue. It has one shaving depth and if you're just trying to get a little off the top it isn't a good device. This is fine for giant thick corns that haven't been kept up with in awhile but if you're going after a regular maintenance routine the one depth fits all won't work too well.The device appears to be well constructed, the sliding safety shield is actually pretty cool and I like the rasp but I'm going back to the simple single edged razor for control purposes. Cheaper, easier and does exactly what I need. I'll hang onto this for the rasp side but I won't be using the corn razor again."
1,poor quality,"Several times during the movie there were no sound effects compared to the original presentation, also the movie had a lot of visually dark scenes especially around the edges of the movie. It's obvious that this was recorded from a VHS tape or a very poor quality DVD. If I had of paid to rent this instead of watching this using my Prime membership I would have asked for a refund."
1,Gimmick,"I agree with the other reviews that this cookbook is nothing more than creative marketing. As a new mom, I was enticed to buy because of the five min cooking time. I can prep holding a baby, but I can't cook with her in my arms. So the less time over heat, the better. However, the recipes consist of a lot of fondue (not a meal, but more of an appetizer), ""ideas"" (brownies w/ sauce on top) rather than real recipes, and too many processed or prepared foods that simply are not widely available (and I live in a metro area!) After reaading other reviews that refer to Rachel Ray I think I'm going to check out her books! At least she uses ingredients that I can find in a grocery store. I've tried several of our specialty grocers and still have not been able to find the majority of the Rocco ingredients. I asked for this book as a birthday gift, and I'm truely saddened to have wasted my mother's money on it!"
1,"Bland, electronic covers","The album contains a collection of bland, electronic sounding covers of REM songs by Studio 99. It is probably not worth your time, though if you like electronic sounds try the free songs for yourself."
2,Captures Author's Intent..Powerful Movie!,"This is a powerful movie. Human desperation played by Muriel Streep and the careful and passionate Clint Eastwood. Eastwoodis definitely worth seeing in this!It's also a great romance about true love, yes it can be achieved!!"
2,"M*A*S*H - Goodbye, Farewell & Amen","I am a MASH junkie, and this is the ultimate MASH DVD. In addition to the ""Last Mash"" episode--which still holds the record for the largest audience ever for a TV show--the DVD includes the MASH 30th Anniversary with all the living members of the cast, and a Shelly Long-hosted ""Memories of Mash, which is very well done.If you like MASH, you will love this DVD."
2,"Wonderful, Peaceful, Calming, Centering Book!","I do, indeed, keep this little book by my bed and reach for it morning, noon and night. The prayers/poems are wonderful, uplifting, inspiring and calming. When I go to bed frazzled, reading the nightfall prayers and poems always helps to calm me.The book is divived into five sections: Inspiration, Comfort, Reflections, Nightfall and Morning.One of my favorite poems is ""Poet's Prayer"" by Kate Robinson:In you through whomall things speak,use me pleaseto sing your song."
1,Worked great.. for a while,"I replaced my original factory wipers with these. They did an amazing job for about 6 months and then they started to streak. Not sure how long wipers are supposed to last, but 6 months seems kind of short. Especially when I live in southern California and it probably only rained 4 times in those six months."
1,Not worth the money,"This router does not work as advertised. It provided no increase in range or speed over my previous D-Link router. Also, there were no instructions included on how to configure the router and the software provided as also deficient."
1,Okay; But Keeps Going and Going and Going,"This book was assigned to me for summer reading projects. This book was okay, but it kinda went on and on and on. It was a hard book to understand and the language was difficult to comprehend and follow. The story took place awhile ago and the languaged depicted is not the same as now, and may be hard for some people to understand! If you are not a true adventurous person and not really interested in non- fiction, then I would not suggest this book for you to read!"
2,A Fun Workout! It's helpful to know the moves first.,"This is indeed a fun workout. The only recommendation I would make would be to learn the bellydance moves first from their Discover Bellydance series(Basic moves, Beyond Basic Dance, Mystic Dance). I found it a bit difficult to keep up with them because I didn't know the moves very well...so I went back to the Discover Bellydance videos to learn them. But once you know them, Veena and Neena will put those lessons to work on your body in an upbeat workout! And, yes, I do agree with a previous reviewer...a sports bra is definitely helpful for the well-endowed as you will be shimmying and bouncing quite a bit."
1,Algebra 1 Book not easy for me,"This Algebra 1 Book could have been written in many ways better. It doesn't seem to explain things well enough. The practice problems are easy, but when you get into the real homework, the problems are very hard. The answers in the back of the book aren't always right and don't show you how they got to the answer. And, as far as i am concerned, the people who wrote this book just looked the information up and copied it down, not really knowing how to teach the subject."
1,Buy a portable DVD Player!,"I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it. I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of). I ended up purchasing some online. By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working. We have replaced the batteries several times. On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare. We are very disappointed with this unit. I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!"
1,Worried about the accuracy of this book.....,"Page 22: ""Important Note: Since the events of September 9, 2001, to ensure the safety of your flight the airline rules have changed dramatically...""Although the parts I did read I enjoyed, this seemed like rather a large error and made me question the accuracy of the rest of the information. Unless I missed something in the news on 9/9/01."
1,Modifier Keys Are Broken,"This keyboard has a lot of nice features, but it falls down on the basics. The modifier keys (alt, ctrl, Shift, Winkey) un-press themselves. For example, if you hold down alt and press tab repeatedly, you would expect to cycle through active applications. If you do this long enough, this keyboard acts as if you had released the alt key. ""Long enough"" is variable -- sometimes 2 keystrokes, sometimes 20+.I tried it with Win XP, and the problem showed up. I booted in safe mode, and the problem showed up. I booted another operating system (Knoppix) and the problem showed up.I ran a keyboard diagnostic routine, the keyboard is sending a key-release scan code for the modifier key, even though I am holding the key down firmly.I have two of these keyboards. Each exhibits the problem. Either it is a design flaw, or they have a defect in the manufacturing process."
1,nice holster terrible clip,"As have many of the others reviewed here my clip broke after 3 weeks so don't waste you money on this one,"
1,OK at first...,"I was basically buying this for listening to movies on the Samsung Blackjack. The Bluetooth protocol really slows down the phone. It is OK for music, but too slow for movies. The Samsung earbud (non-Bluetooth) works, but hurts my ears. So I bought a Blackjack analog universal audio adapter to output to this HT820. I only hear garbage for audio. If I plug in the HT820 to computer speakers, sound is OK. If I plug the Blackjack to computer speakers from the adapter, sound is OK. If I plug in the Blackjack to analog input of HT820, sound is garbage! I tried several in-between cables, but no luck."
1,expensive battery - does not last long,"Bought product and checked out good. Like the interface (color code to indicates high/normal temp). A few month later when I needed it, battery was dead. New battery from Radio Shack costed $3.25, which was by the way not available in common stores (walmart, target, walgreen, etc.)."
2,Great book!!!!,"I am still reading this book and what I have read so far captures and spirit and delight of the Dachshund personality.....and for little dogs, they do have HUGE personalities. They are fearless, delightful, amusing and never stop loving. This book conveys all of this!!! It is written in a manner that makes you not want to put it down.Anybody who is or ever has been ""owned"" by a Dachshund (I have three!) is guaranteed to delight in this book!"
1,Silicon Ice Trays,"When we got this product, we were in love. They were fantastic ice trays but after a few months of using them, we noticed that our ice started to taste foul. After a while, we stopped using ice all together and figured that it was the odors in the freezer that were being absorbed by the ice. I finally decided to try different ice trays by rubbermaid and discovered that the ice tasted normal again and had no after taste. Turns out that these silicon trays were making our ice taste bad which is pretty scary to think that something has been leaching from the silicon trays into our ice. I would never recommend or use these silicon trays ever again. Immediately throw into the trash!"
1,Zzzzzzz,"Too long, boring plot (near zero drama), peppered with numerous implausibilities from the school of sci-fi writing that thinks it can throw in whatever utopian, hair-brained idea it likes (almost at random) without regard to context or economic plausibility. Bleah. Three stars for concept, minus two for draining the life from it."
2,THIS IS WORTH COLLECTING ..........,"i have read everything , from sydney sheldon to ken follet but i must bow down to the MASTER.Its a tragedy this great writer is not on this earth to treat us anymore but he has left his legacy behind.Whoever wants to read a masterpiece should give this 1 a try.This 1 is a collectors item.i dont want to repeat the cliche....but DONT MISS IT."
1,Don't waste your money,"As all the others, my power supply just died as well. They wanted $99 for me to fix this inferior product.Stay clear"
2,Excellent Work,"A great movie to watch and just enjoy. Gone are the days of movie fun before all the special effects of todays films. This is the way we all use watch movies; sitting on the edge of our seats, biting nails and watching scary monsters come out of the sea."
2,Good Product,"This is a good home wax. It actually works, although there is a bit of a learning curve, and it didn't irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Yes, it hurts. It hurts like waxing hurts - nothing more, nothing less. I was able to rip the wax off quickly and so the pain didn't last long. It's a bit messy, but again, learning curve.I ordered more because now I want to do my whole body (heh) and I included the wax warmer on my second order just for the convenience of having the wax warmer in the bathroom with me while I work."
1,Its great unless you want to use it,"Just purchased the waterpik. Never got to use it. Charged it the first time as instructed, filled the reservoir, inserted the tip and turned it on. It blew the tip off each time. E-mailed Waterpik, and explained the problem. Their solution- take it back. I did..."
2,To late?,"My oldest daughter, (20 years), has developed breast cancer in both breasts. Some years ago we went to a low meat diet. However, dairy products became a large part of our diet. She ran cross-country and had difficulty with mucus in her throat and other hints of problems to come. In doing research on this cancer I was shown this book by a friend. It has helped her change her diet to fight the cancer and I have also changed the diet for myself and youngest daughter. I wish I had seen this research years ago."
2,Great package!,I love the packaging on this product & it is all kept well in one box. Of course I am an Angel fan so I love all the extras on the dvd's. Thnx!
1,BUY SOMETHING ELSE,"There is little doubt that this guy can play the guitar and , if you do not care about anything other than guitar solos, then possibly this CD is for you. However, for those of us that appreciate good guitar combined with good vocals and a tight rhythm, you should look elsewhere. While Mr. Sardinas can play, he cannot carry a tune. This is not for the weak hearted."
2,Why don't you kill me?,"This CD features Beck's big hit ""Loser"", plus three previously unreleased songs from his early years. It's all typical Beck from the time period (not that there is such a thing as ""typical Beck""). Beck's fans should enjoy this CD."
2,The return of rock...finally.,"After suffering through years of mediocre to good rock albums, RHCP return with a full blown masterpiece. The songs are layered, the musicianship is exceptional, and nearly every track is a gem. This is their best album since ""Blood Sugar Sex Magic"". Between Flea's inspired bass riffing, John Frisciante's spirit lifting guitar solos, Chad Smith's great percussion work, and Anthony Kiedis's shifting and impressive vocal work, Stadium Arcadium makes it evident that this is a veteran band at the peak of their talents. Yes, it's more laid back then previous albums but get past that and you'll realize it's still on of the best albums to come out in years."
2,Love this thing!!,"I have moderatly curly hair and have never known how to style it. I am uncoordinated with flat irons and round brushes with hair dryers. This thing is awsome. I can easily style my hair straight and not feel like I need an extra hand. It is adjustable depending how curly your hair is. It is easily packable for traveling. Apply straightning product, if desired, after you wash, then style when your hair is about two thirds dry, or if you wash your hair at night, just dampen it a little in the AM and style."
1,Beware! Use without guard = injury!!!,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. I recommend that you NEVER trim without the guard, especially inside the bikini line. This trimmer 'bites' sensitive areas and will cause bleeding/pain. The shaver attachment only works with stubble, nothing longer than 1/16th of an inch. Even with stubble it takes too many passes to completely shave areas."
2,Don't let the first chapter turn you off,"I had a little trouble with the first couple of chapters, the main male character is such a domineering alpha-male *&^% (insert expletive here). Once beyond that, I could not put this book down. I really enjoyed the Valkrye, Weres, and Vamps. If you like paranormal romance, you'll enjoy this one. If you like this one and haven't tried: Charlaine Harris or Kelly Armstrong you should."
1,Why bother?,This is the Japanese version of the first album. There are no bonus tracks or special features of any kind. Don't waste your money.
1,Poorly designed,"I was excited to find a way to use my own coffee with my Keurig brewer and purchased a My K-Cup. The first time I used it, water sprayed all over and the coffee was weak, weak, weak. I thought I was doing something wrong, so I looked everything over, reviewed the directions and tried again. Same problem.Apparently, the gasket on the top needle doesn't seat into the My K-Cup device snugly enough to keep the water from washing out of the top hole, over the sides and out the bottom of the brewing spout -- it doesn't go through the coffee grounds and splatters everywhere.I have read that there is a ""fix"" by moving the gasket on the needle down or buying a gasket at a home repair store, but why should that be necessary? This is a brand new product that was DESIGNED (supposedly) to work with the same brand of coffee brewer. Keurig should redesign this device."
2,Oud master at his best,"Munir Bachir was one of the best oud players of all times and this two set CD is a must have for any music lover. Bachir's work has been inspiring for so many musicians who explore the maqam. The improvisations are extremely well executed as usual, and if one needs to pick one single solo oud recording, this is probably the one. The sound is also very good.Highly recommended!!!"
2,Beautiful,"This is an unbelievable beautiful book and for the price, unbelievable quality. Wonderful book to daydream about Sedona"
2,Seabiscuit is my hero here in 2004!,"It took me a while to get thru the first part because the author writes about the history of the owner and the jockey. It got interesting when I got to the middle of the book. The book is full of old photos of Seabiscuit and some of his races. I actually cried during some of the sad parts. I just wished I was there back in the 30's so I could really see Seabiscuit in a race. I was never a horse lover, but after reading this book I realized what a great horse Seabiscuit was and what a true American hero he was for people back then. I'm glad Laura Hillenbrand wrote this book so Seabiscuit would not be forgotten."
1,Throw it back,"Sure I could listen to this but why would I when I could put in Live at Leeds? All talk, no walk kitschy cheeze. I'd rather listen to Poison."
2,This is da bomb!,"Kottonmouth Kings truly brings a new definition to this genre, you gotta love their strong music!Lotza hugz, GothAngel"
2,good condition,"Good condition product, it took a while to be delivered, but it is in a really good condition, Thank you"
1,Agonizing read,This book liked to kill me. So slow and without suspense. A real let down. Don't waste your time.
1,Missing something...,"Why don't they take Lawrence Sanders' name off the McNally books? Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth, since he makes mistakes with reference to Sanders' stories. Archy states he doesn't want to get married if he can't have a marriage as perfect as his parents. Lardo apparently is unaware that the ""pater"" had an affair in one of Sanders' installments! Archy isn't quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob. Al Rogoff was hardly in this one and I missed him. Archy's living with a girlfriend and there are few references to the McNally ""manse"", dinners with the folks, etc. And the climax was anything but; a true anticlimax that was over before I realized. Time to hang up the series? I do believe."
2,water tight & comfortable,Purchased based on other reviews. I wear when also wearing contacts. No leakage and very comfortable. No need to adjust for an hour of swimming.
2,Great product with a couple of irritating aspects,"I've had my Zen Touch for about two weeks now, and I love it! I'm a poor college student so the price worked for me, and I've had absolutely no problems with it. Two little irritating things though:The touchpad is super sensitive, even on the lowest setting it's still really easy to scroll over what you're looking more. But with a little practice it get easier.The software truly is crap, which is why I only gave four stars instead of five. If you're going to transfer music I would just use Windows Media Player. It's super simple and most people already know how to use it."
1,Super-awful,"It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her."
1,Buyer Beware! Tipping Hazard!,"We purchased this item because it LOOKED nice and was a great (cheap!)price. We are, however, extremely dissapointed with the quality of this item. Drawers are very small, although the facings are large. The dresser appears nice, especially for the price, however once we assembled it (about 1 1/2 hrs) and moved it into my son's room onto carpet, we noticed the problem. It is extremely unsteady and would tip forward, even if one drawer is opened. VERY UNSAFE! We took it back to local Target for a refund and they told us we have to disassemble it and mail it back to online Target. My husband left the dresser there at Target and told them to throw it in the garbage where it belongs. (The dresser company provided a tip resistance kit, which is basically one screw and a small bracket, but we still don't feel that it is safe.) Buy something else! One star is too high for this item."
2,Great Book!,Great for learning how do draw the DC characters with detailed steps and tips on how to draw them you can't go wrong if you buy this book.
2,possessed priest punishes sinners,"This is one of the most creepy and original horror films ever! Like Phantasm, you can tell this is the directors nightmare he made into a movie especially when there's no explanation why things are happening. A priest gets possessed by the devil in an elaborate plan to not only kill a handful of people but terrorize them over the weekend at a class reunion. If you like surprises in the your horror, with this, you can't guess how the next scene will go down. Well acted (especially by priest T.g. finkbinder) by one hit wonder actors. The soundtrack deserves credit for not letting you relax between kills. A very underrated flick. Windowboxed at 1.66:1 the picture is grindhouse good."
1,Heldrix blues review,These songs came out prior to his death in 1969. A person would think that the sound quality of these songs would have been better..
2,red zinger YUM,"I love this stuff cold. I make a pot, chill it and keep it in my fridge ready to go. No calorie yumminess."
2,"a very unique, refreshing contribution to modern rock","I heard the single ""Hello Time Bomb"" and I thought, There's a great rock song. I wanted to check out the rest of the album. Well, I did not find Time Bomb #2,#3,#4. At first I was disappointed; I had expected a hard-rocking album. Instead I was rewarded with a deep, melodic, varied album. To explain their sound I say imagine this:Take the catchy hooks and guitar-drive of Tonic or Seven Mary Three, add the emotional punch of Fuel and Oleander, and the melodies of Splender. I'd say they are most similar to Oleander, but they really have a unique sound. Check it out for something NEW in the world of modern/alternative rock. Highlights: aforementioned Time Bomb, also ""Deep Six"", ""Load Me Up"", ""Failing the Rorschach Test"", and I really like ""Jenny's Song."""
2,Sponges to match the George Foreman grill surface,The shape of this sponge is perfect for the indoor grills and cleans well without scratching. I also have found it to be very durable.
2,Let's Make This Perfectly Clear: Good Book.,"The story goes like this: I decided I wanted to be a fiddler after 4 decades as a guitarist. Apparently there's more to it than owning a fiddle and knowing what good fiddling should sound like. This book (and the accompanying DVD) got me from here to there in simple, understandable lessons.Even after the first lesson, I felt like I really knew something. ""The American Fiddle Method"" from Mel Bay steps you through a helpful introduction to the instrument, right and wrong ways to hold your hands, and more. You'll be playing music to the applause of your pets, parents, children, spouse, and anyone else in your living room in no time. Assuming your pets can applaud, that is.Go ahead. Buy it. You spent all that money on a violin. Learn how to play it!"
2,I loved it.,I have read this and another book by the author(Streets of New York) and find his writing style to be very realistic.The storyline depicted is a harsh reality of some.The storyline was easy to follow(I finished the book in 1 day)and I did not want to put it down.The action in the book was non-stop and kept me interested in seeing what would happen next. I have met the author and he is very approachable and pleasant to talk to.I am anxiously awaiting his new books.I hope that he continues to write.
1,Dreadful,"This is the sort of movie you and your friends might make on a long weekend, assuming someone was silly enough to give you millions of dollars to do so. But, when you're a famous director this is exactly what happens. Good actors are wasted on a plot that lurches from one gun fight to the next. I suppose, if pressed to say something nice I will say that the way color is used in this movie is excellent but there is literally nothing else to recommend."
2,An heroic epic!,"Although written in the early 20th century, this novel clearly falls within the romanticism genre of the 19th century.As with Hugo and Dumas, Sabatini's novel comprises heroic characters and an interesting plot against the backdrop of an epic event in human history (in this case, the French Revolution). The flourish of Sabatini's writing style matches the panache of Andre-Louis, his protagonist, and the reader is easily swept into a universe in which a man can be ""born with the gift of laughter and the sense that the world was mad.""If you enjoy the heroism of Hugo and the swashbuckling plots of Dumas then you will love falling into the world created by Sabatini."
2,A great book!,"This is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. It's so touching and very well written. Fair warning: This book is not for the faint of heart. It's extremely sad in some parts. I usually am pretty unemotional when reading a book, but this really touched me and I had tears in my eyes. I recommend this to anyone and everyone, young or old. The characters are very well developed. By the end of the story, I felt as though I had made some new friends. I esepecially felt for Johnny, a character who is emotionally traumatized and who you can't help but feel sorry for. Once again, I highly recommend the Outiders. It teaches you that there is a lot more to the common ""hoodlum"" than what meets the eye."
2,Avery Triple Click,Good alll purpose device for someone who needs a stylus for PDA and only wants to carry one pen
1,"Oh, good grief","Trading up? Uh-uh. Trading on her fame, that's what Candace Bushnell has done. And it's definitely a letdown, after Sex and the City. The whole schtick centers around some model named Janey Wilcox, and you know what? By the end, I just didn't care a whit what happens to her.Fergeddit, IMO."
1,Ok - You get what you pay for,"I paid $10 for this item and that is what it is worth. The cord is too short, if you attempt to pour too fast, boiling water spills out of the top and scalds your hand. It is cheaply made and sometimes it does not shut off at all (supposed to shut off automatically when water boils). Top cover is cheap plastic and hard to open..know it will break within a year. Product was scratched and somewhat dirty (black stains and marks on exterior) and appeared reconditioned...but for $10.00, I'll use it til it breaks. Would not recommend or purchase again."
2,Right On!,Irene has done it again!!! Bringing you into her world with her sassy style. You definitely will not be disappointed.
1,As good as Van Halen 3,"Well, what a suprise. I guess this is the latest trend. To completely suck. I pretty much only listen to Megadeth's first 3 albums anyway. I guess Dave's trying to be a guest VJ on MTV or something. Yes, if the Backstreet Boys made a heavy metal album, it would sound like Risk. If you haven't heard this cd yet, take 15 dollars out of your wallet and throw it away because it's the same thing. It is a Risk to buy this cd."
1,Not $15 Lab Fee!,The description reads that the lab analysis fee is $15. Wrong!! It is $30!!! Twice as much. That's over $40 (counting the cost of the kit). You can probably get something locally done cheaper.
1,Depressing,"I know it isn't very trendy to say so, but I consider the Chilis one of the more important 80s and early 90s bands--Blood Sugar Sex Magic was 60+ minutes of sustained brilliance. Californication is an obvious attempt to recapture that. Rick Rubin and John Frusciante are back, the sound of the band is somewhat similar, everyone can still play, but somehow, it all sounds forced. How can you measure inspiration? I don't know, but the songs just aren't there for me. It's sad--I really wanted to like this record, just like I really wanted to like One Hot Minute. I'll check out By the Way, but I've stopped expecting much.... Still, these guys have paid their dues--if they want to put out mediocre albums for the next ten years and rake in the bucks, more power to them."
2,Long lasting,This sturdy shovel will definitely last a long time. The flattened areas for pushing the shovel in the ground really make it easier on your foot. It is well built and we are very pleased with it.
1,Extremely disappointing!!!,I have NiCad batteries that outlast these Lithium Ion batteries & NiCad batteries are the most primitive of rechargeable batteries. Also the button that is supposed to lock the spindle so that the collet can be tightened and untightened became useless in a very short time. It bogs down at the slightest resistance making it very difficult to get the job done. I'm buying a Black & Decker instead.
1,334,"One keeps bouncing off nebulous plot lines. Inimical to the reader, it is like scaling the perpetual slippery slope.Thomas Disch's use of historical retrospectives obfuscates the message here.This work was better left as a collection of personal cameos of the destitute characters written in short story format. This work has no claim to higher level fiction.Finishing this should be rewarded with a money back guarantee."
2,This Book Really Is To Die For,"I loved this book (and its sequel ""Drop Dead Gorgeous""). Both books have both mystery and romance and are written in way that is easy to read. I really liked the characters and the hilarious way they interact with eachother. I hope that Howard writes more novels about this entertaining couple, but the books don't appear to be written in a way to allow more books to follow, which is a shame."
1,Very Disappointed,Poor quality switch and 12V plug!!!. No storage provided for power cord and poor storage for air hose. This model is of inferior quality to a similar one from Interdynamics that I had used for over 8 years. I prefer the Campbell Hausfeld RP3200 which is well built and works fine.
1,Bad product fast fracture,Bad product fast fractureI can not believe that one of the most popular products !!!!!!!!!Do not recommend purchase for several reasons .. Including:TenderDifficult cleaningInaccurate sizes ..
2,Suchet great;photography unappealing,"I agree-the price is way too high.Suchet is great,butthe photography is unappealing on older equipment.Fuzzy,[like the lens was dusty/foggy] and dark.I'm surprisedmore reviewers haven't mentioned this. I do miss Ms.Lemon,Inspector Japp (it's misleading to have them mentionedin the ""headlines""). I appreciate having the subtitles."
2,glass baking pans,"I love both of these glass pans. I used the small one to cook a pork loin and the clean up was so easy.I use the large one for baking cakes and I don't have to clean the pan, it is usually licked clean."
2,Guayaki tea is great,"I love the Guayaki brand and had seen the chocolatte flavor online but never in stores until my last trip to Mother's Market (where it was on sale for 4.19, regularly 6.49.) I'm glad I picked it up, it's a great tea, great flavor, no sweetener needed but it tastes closer to chai to me than it does chocolate. I add a tablespoon of organic cacao powder and some organic vanilla almond milk to make it a ""dessert tea."""
1,"Looks good, but horrible Customer Service","This product is heavy and looks to be of very good quality. However I had an issue and it took 4 phone calls to Customer Service (the locksmith) with no returned call or resolution for me to return the product. I was transfered to the knowledge expert 2 times after being told that the person is at the desk and that they will resolve the issue. The call went to voice mail. 4 messages with no response. Good luck if you buy it, you are on your own.The funny thing is that it states all over the packaging and directions to call for help. Yeah funny!!!"
1,Thomas the tank engine train and set,We bought this with my sister and the train transformer portion broke within 20 minutes rendering the entire present worthless.. Getting it replaced turned into something simply not worth pursuing. Fortunately my nephew was a good sport about it. We bought a different train on e bay that was used and it works well.
2,Easy to read and interesting!,"Judaism cannot be reviewed in one book, but this is a good start for those who want to know more about Judaism. I explored Judaism almost three years ago when I started dating a Jewish man and this was a great beginning step for me. It provides facts, albeit brief, into history, teachings, and beliefs. So many of my questions were answered in the first few chapters. If you don't have a lot of time to read, this is also a great book because it's so thorough and user-friendly. It's a great resource to ground you into more complex teachings later.I recommend this fun book to anyone wanting to learn more about this amazing religion, or as a brush up!"
1,Weak -- at best,"This ""tool"" comes without a battery or charger. What's more, there appears to be no way to order a battery for it.Got sawdust on a workbench? This thing would *probably* work okay.Got leaves in your front yard? Get a real tool instead."
2,Unforgettable and truly interesting,"An amazing story of expectations and choices. Was she called to be a nun or was the life simply pressed upon her?Baldwin takes you behind the convent walls and into the hearts, lives, and true humanity of these nuns. They aren't perfect, and it takes a certain type of person to live the cloistered life.It is interesting to compare it with Memoirs of a Geisha. While Memoirs defends the virtues of a lifestyle, Called and Chosen lays open the faults of a lifestyle--both of which have been somewhat misunderstood. Yet, both authors weave their stories with such honesty and passion that you can't help but appreciate their renderings.I would recommend it to anyone interested in a candid look at convent life from the last century."
2,Great price~,"My wife went to the US Cellular store to buy my battery and it was $47.00 plus tax! I went online and found this battery at about a $40.00 savings, took the other battery back for a refund and had my new one in about 3 days!!!! Fast shipping and a GREAT price! I'll be back for more in the future!"
1,Easy to follow recipes,"The recipes are very good, easy to follow and acessible for someone who isn't an experienced cook like me. The only complaint I have is that there isn't an index of recipes, or even a meaningful table of contents which details the menu of each meal. This is why I am only giving this book 2 stars."
2,Not bad,"Good price and fast shipping but it's a little big which is not a deal breaker, i only use it maybe once a week and it works great."
1,Gerontological nurse Practitioner Certified Nurse Examination series,"I was very disappointed in this book. The book is comprised of test questions with no rationales for the correct answers. Some of the questions are exceedingly easy and general so that without even studying the content, someone with half brain could figure out the answer. I had my husband, who is not a nurse, try a couple of the questions and he of course answered the questions easily. It looks best in the picture- with the cover closed."
2,"Stick to the standards, T!","Terence Blanchard is undoubtedly one of the top jazz performers of our time, regardless of instrument. However (and this is just my opinion), I don't care much for his original material. I much prefer releases in which he interprets other writers' works (e.g., The Billie Holliday Songbook, The Heart Speaks). So you can only imagine how much I enjoy listening to Let's Get Lost. This CD is outstanding not just in the interpretations, arrangements and production (all are flawless), but Blanchard has surrounded himself with four wonderful vocalists to support his vision of McHugh's standards.This is one of my favorite late-night CD's. Blanchard's tone, as always, is pure, clean and sweet. I was introduced to several McHugh songs that I hadn't heard before. With over 60 minutes of quality performances, it is simply too hard to pick out a favorite cut. Quality stuff - Daddy like. Also check out the other two Blanchard CD's mentioned above."
2,Great for work,"I keep this at my desk because I don't like the coffee offerings in the office. My only complaint is that it gets a little noisy towards the end of the brewing cycle. Other than that, it's great!"
2,A Life-changing story?,"It was for me. When I was 7 years old and in the 2nd I had never read a novel before, not even a shorter one. I didn't much care for reading, I thought it was boring. My teacher, however, saw right through me. When our class made its weekly trip to the library, she recommended this book to me. She told me that if I started to read this book, I wouldn't be able to stop until I'd finished. Turns out she was right. I ended up skipping recess to read part of the story, I just couldn't get enough of it. I ran straight home from the bus that afternoon and kept reading the book, until I had finished it cover-to-cover. I have loved reading ever since then, and this book, in particular, has left an impression with me that hasn't faded in over ten years."
2,Great for the price,Being an average golfer that occasionally loses balls on the course and cannot tell much between an expensive brands and this one. It does the job at a fair price. I'll be reordering.
1,The author should be forbidden to write and replant the trees used for paper to print this book!,"There are loads of reviews about this book already, so i'll be brief. This book would have had a potential (the story is intriguing and parts about Bombay are interesting) had it been written by someone else. The author and his self-love have killed it! It was so bad that i feel i have to voice my awe and warn others! The acknowledgment section of the book actually contains words ""this novel is written in blood and tears"" and ""many pages of this manuscript ... are stained and streaked with my blood""?! The 900 pages prior to that are filled with megalomaniacal and self-grandiose rubbish and only maybe about 50 pages were worth reading... What happened to quality control and editors?"
2,Saving gums and teeth,"This is a wonderful piece of equipment. It does everything from saving gums, brushing teeth, cleaning the tongue and so on.This is one of the best investments I have made. The use of salt, baking soda and peroxide, with this Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, is one of the best gifts you can give your mouth. If you don't mind leaning over the sink while using it, you willkeep your mouth healthy for years. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Ok, but some mistakes... barely responsive customer service","I have purchased this item and the shorter version. During my studies I was told by several Vietnamese that some words and forms of address taught by Pimsleur were incorrect (and could be insulting). For instance, the word 'chi' should never be used to address a younger woman; you are calling her an old man. Although this thread runs through the course, most of it is OK... if you don't mind making the correct substitutions yourself. When customer service was contacted they said they would have a linguist 'get back to me'. Never happened."
2,licence tag cover,I have been a fan of this product for along time and have had both fun and profit using it.Far superior to other products like it.
2,great packaging,"When I first saw the product online, I thought the box set was one complete book and turned out it wasn't. That was my main concern. When I recieved the box set, I also expected the books to come in a less stable box. Like the ones you would buy at the book store. Again to my surprise it didn't. The box came in a wooden-like box, a diffenite plus. All in all the product was more than I expected it to be in the buyer beware sales system where it's you get what you see. So I highly recomend this box set to anyone who considering buying the first three Alex Rider books."
1,Read something else,"This book is the nadir of Battletech authorship. To be fair, other authors, like Robert Thurston and Thomas Gressman, have certainly had shaky starts, but I don't look forward to another installment from Rice. The book had nothing to do with the Battletech Universe, the characters were one dimensional (barely), and the plot was rife with holes. It was like reading a first draft written in crayon."
1,Too expensive,The one on Amazon cost way too much. I found same thing for 1/2 the price at mindware.com. I don't believe any of them are as good as the Labyrinths sold years age but they are still fun.
2,Yes! M!ch!gan!,"Catton covers two centuries in 11 chapters and just under 200 pages. The book is literally crammed with information in a mishmash of military acquisitions, missionaries, Native American tribes (at least a dozen are mentioned), woods runners, capitalists and (of coarse) politicians. However, Catton makes good use of brevity: he does not waste print on the minutiae of strategic military maneuverings as so many historians do, but rather he carefully selects and explores the details of the social and technological events that shaped the territory, the state and the nation (the ""open shop"" lumber industry, federal land grant programs, the Toledo strip, ""wildcat"" banks and the Great Railroad Conspiracy). As historians (and Michiganders) go, Catton is a romantic, and even melodramatic at times, but never boring. This book is thoroughly enjoyable."
1,wooden Seagal and annoying Ja Rule make this a crapheap,"oh boy, where to begin. Seagal is send to prison undercover and then Morris Chestnut breaks in and they want some money or something, I dont know I got lost in the beginning and then sorta fell asleep for 20 minutes, woke up and then fell asleep again when a stupid action scene came on or the ever so girly running Seagal started to fight. man, Seagal's movies have gotten way crappy all of a sudden. you had The Patriot, The Glimmer Man, Exit Wounds, The Foreinger, I mean come on man, do some drama or something, forget this crap. and Ja Rule took a big leap from The Fast and The Furious to this. Seagal even Chestnut has had a better career lately then you man"
1,All but one song lacks substance and depth,"All the songs on this CD sound so exceptionally corny. The only song I felt was good was ""The Perfect Fan."" All the other tracks are boring and their lyrics make NO SENSE AT ALL. Any concept or meaning of ""I Want It That Way"" seems non-existant. Also, the vocative title ""Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely"" contradicts the lyrics of the 'song' which is calling for somebody to come back to them. Then there's the group's boring and lackadaisical personalities which makes listening to the CD even more unbearable. I've seen them on TV and interviews and they are so boring, obnoxious, and cocky that I automatically change the channel (that is if I don't fall asleep before I can reach for the remote). The only reason I purchased this CD (and later returned it) was because I had heard another pop group's recent album, enjoyed it, and decided to try more of the boy band genre- big mistake."
1,king of ny,Video doe not work i will be returning this product.i was ready to watch this weekn but i could the disc was no good
2,This game really sparked my interest in NASCAR!,"This was the first racing sim game I had ever purchased. Playing NASCAR Racing 3 really got me more interested in the sport which caused me to watch it more on TV. I like being able to adjust the cars setup, to see if you can improve on your lap times. I have played this game using only the keyboard, standard steering wheel(no force feedback), and a force feedback steering wheel. To me, it is best played using a force feedback steering wheel. But I must admit that I learned how to adjust my car setup so that I could play it using just the keyboard as the controller only, but some tracks I just could not navigate using the keyboard as the controller.The one thing that I really don't like about NASCAR Racing 3 is when you lose one or both of you rear tires, it is impossible to get back to the pits. (Unless I just have not figured it out yet.)"
1,P90X plus,"This was a major let down after doing the original P90x version. The workouts are not challenging at all compared to the original workouts, and the format is not as good either. Instruction is not as good, and timing between exercises is to close. I plan on using them to add into my original P90X workout routine as add ons."
2,great start,"evanesence is a talented band, ben moody with his amazing guitar skills and amy lee with her beautiful singing, songwriting and piano skills is a perfect collaboration and I look forward to hearing more from evanesence, especially more musical diversity"
2,The best introduction to Gesualdo's music at a budget price,"This recording is most valuable, not only for helping to put Gesualdo in his proper context, but also for the harmonically assured, flexible and verbally sensitive singing of this group. They can mark up a distinct success: Lionel Salter ""The Gramophone"" London England"
1,All ego. Poorly written.,"Was there even an editor on this book? I kept running into spelling errors and just poorly written passages.I had high hopes for this book, myself being a ""punk buddhist"", but I found this was just a story about Noah Levine. All he does is talk about himself over and over. I was so bored. I couldn't even finish it, half-way through I had to put it down.If you want to read an amazing book on punk and dharma, then you NEED to read Brad Warner's Hardcore Zen. I read this after my failed attempt at Dharma Punx and was blown away. Hardcore Zen is such an amazing book, it's on my top 5 list of most favorite books of all time.Sorry Noah."
1,The silver lining peels off,"I was so excited to bake with this cute little pan. When I took out my first batch they looked great, but with a closer look there was silver peeling from the pan on the cheesecakes. Couldn't serve them, tried baking a new batch and the same thing happened. Am going to return the pan and look for another product."
2,So cute!,My kids absolutely love Nursing Nana and Nursing Nina. They are so soft and cuddly and the little puppies and kitties are adorable.
2,funny and real story of growing up in a big family,"A great read, with some hilarious images of the way growing up was and poignant memories of the way life flows."
2,Worth the While,"So Zanna,Don't! will never be a ""great"" musical. It probably shouldnt be considered one either. Nonetheless, its a great listen. After the first month or two, it didnt inspire the same excitement as it used to but I would be lying if I said that I didn't fall utterly in ""love"" with it. As a matter of fact, I couldn't stop listening to it and even recommended it to several friends (despite their lack of interest in musicals). Almost half a year later, I still find myself listening to it when I'm in the mood. So don't be too bothered by the excessive use of the word love in this show because whats wrong with a little ""extra love""? Buy it! It's worth the while."
2,So funny you will want to visit the bathroom before you watch it.,"This is truly one of the funniest movies I've been to see in a long time. It's a chic-flick but much, much, more! It will lift whatever mood you are in for sure! Enjoy."
2,Timeless Soul,"I found him..... at a price!!!! But well worth every penny and more. Timeless music for your MIND, BODY and SOUL. If you feel Love, this is what it sounds like - LOVE CONQUERS ALL........ Thank you Michael."
2,Works great,Does not leak but very minimal of the fine tea leaves and I can brew a large amount. Love it!
2,Delivers its promise,"This book keeps its promise of delivering ""101 essential tips"". From choosing cutting tools to repairing a button hole, there are lots of tips to satisfy the beginner sewer. While I like the layout, which includes step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos, this little book could be vastly improved by adding a few more pictures to some of the tips to make them more clear. A couple of pictures could also be improved by better choice of colour (e.g. attaching a flat collar, which is a glaring yellow, and darning a hole, which is so well done you cannot see the example stitches clearly enough!). Nevertheless, overall it is a very useful book."
2,Best book in a while,"Typically, I would not have picked up a book like this. I love lore, and historial stories, but I won't really spend the time in a book like this. I am so happy I decided to read this book. It was beautiful. She captures the charaters, the love, the fear, the lore so well. The people that Paul and Helen come into contact with are written so well I feel as if I know them. I realize that the monks were a big part to the story-- but I wish she did not include the whole Chronicle. I hope she continues to write, because I will be buying her next book. This is not a book written to tell some new twist on history-- or some one trying to expose some truth in history. It was a well spoken story in history that made you love the characters. A must read."
1,More information needed,"This book is very vague and for lack of another source, it was the only reason I bought it. True bulldoggers know the facts of this breed. Maybee someday John Germeroth of Colorado will inspire us with his knowledge and training ability"
1,the sheltered woman,"There is no doubt that Didion is a great writer. She displays it here as well but it seems that what she might have viewed as magical thinking might come off as more like the exclusive guide to mourning. Her memories are so chock full of exotic locations, expensive hotels and restaurants, that it makes it hard to actually feel for her as she was obviously going through such a traumatic time in her life.Also I found that she never let us know Quintana. Her memories were not enlightening nor did they give us any window into their relationship. There is no doubt of her love but what did Quintana feel?I am really surprised this book has been so well received. Beyond her world of the literati and the L.A. glitterati, who can relate?"
1,Not well made,"Bought this mostly to hang on the wall with some of my junk collection. Fits in rather well I think, came pre-distressed.I have about 6-7 other hand drills, one is a two speed, 24""-30"" (depending on which top handle is used, stright ones, have 2 lengths or a cast steel metal breast plate to really get with it, made 1920's or earlier, this for serious hand drilling.Great Neck is a good name in tools, have a number of mechanic's but they have gone down hill with their out sourcing.Drill no. 42, the gears make a lot of noise, doesn't turn smooth, cannot say anything about the chuck as did not drill anything before I hung it on the wall.Use an English made, about the same size, has double gears, real quite, light weight, smooth turning, when I need to do any precision small drilling like 1/64"" and smaller.Would not recommend this if you are looking for a real hand drill."
2,"5 stars- I love it, arrived well","5 stars- I love it, arrived well5 stars- I love it, arrived well5 stars- I love it, arrived well"
2,Perfect for our needs,"This alarm system was perfect for our needs. We decided to use the window alarms on our sliding door and door to our garage, as I felt I wanted the doors secured most. They work perfectly there. Also, our bedroom is downstairs but the kids are upstairs, so I always worried that I wouldn't hear an intruder come in and go up. There is no missing the sound of this alarm! If it doesn't instantly scare someone away (which I think it would), it will at least alert us that someone has broken in. I also use the chime system during the day which is perfect w/ two toddlers so I'll always know if someone has opened a door."
1,still haven't received my sticker,It's been over a month and i still haven't got my sticker. They never responded to my email either. Good thing it was only 3 dollars.DONT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE!!!!!!!
2,Nice,Bought this for a friend and he loves it. This item is good to have if you are a guiter player.
1,Smoking Rabbit Tabacco Pipe,"I was disappointed to read on the third page ""The Smoking of Rabbit Tabacco Pipe"". I realize in the days of Beatrix Potter this may have been ok as part a character sketch but this book was written in 1995, a time of the ""Dangers From Smoking"" enlightenment. Did the author mean to encourage little children to smoke? We'll have to change the words to ""Bubble Pipe"" when this book is read to our grand child."
2,one of the best classic movies of all time,Every parents should have this movie in their collections for their kids. A classic story of prince charming coming to the rescue to save the lovely snow white.
2,Nice quality adapter.,"I've used the Panasonic RP-CC20 cassette adapter for several weeks now. The sound quality is great with my MP3 player. If my car engine is off, I can hear a slight mechanical sound of the cassette being 'played', but this is no different than any other cassette in the stereo and I'm unable to hear it when the engine is running. Aside from that, there's no static, humming, or other noise that I've found so far.The adapter's cord is sufficiently long that I can have the MP3 player in the back seat if I wanted to, for whatever reason. The cassette part looks and feels reasonably solid. I expect that this adapter will last for a good while."
1,Major flaw in design,"These are sturdy and in principal should be much better than the clip on T post insulators. However, when you screw them down, the threaded body collapses, so you can't crank them down tightly. The design flaw is obvious - a plastic stop needs to be cast into the back part of the slot to keep this rigid. There is a small triangular set of mating stops there, but they don't line up and are too thin to work. Such a simple thing, I wonder why the manufacturer doesn't fix this."
1,"Great Show, Defective Blu Ray Disc","Everything they say about this show is true, but the enjoyment is spoiled by the fact that I've encountered a manufacturer's defect in the blu-ray version--near the end of episode 10, disc 3---there is a loud buzz for about 30 seconds. This occurred on both my original order, which I returned for an exchange. And, it is present on the replacement order which I just received. And I've had to submit a return authorization for a refund. Definately a manufacturer's defect--maybe in a certain batch produced within a certain period of time. I am surprised that there have been no other compliants. It might be wise to wait a while before purchasing. I'm very disappointed."
2,ROBOT MUZAK,"don ross is an oustanding acoustic guitarist. most of the songs here are solo pieces played on various alternately tuned 6,7 & 8 string acoustics. his playing at times can floor you and alone he still sounds like a full orchestra. but this isn' t his first outing and he doesn' t show us anything new here. the problem here, is that he seems to be running out of ideas. his weakness, composing, stands out.check out don' s earlier work like 'huron street', 'passion session' and the rare 'this dragon won' t sleep' (features outstanding live version of 'zarzuella'). 'this dargon won' t sleep' also has more playing within small ensembles.despite the above comments, the cd is a very good listen. his earlier work is just far better, he' s that good! if u' ve never heard don' s playing before u'll enjoy 'robot monster'(great title by the way). this type of virtuosity is anomolous!looking forward to don' s new ideas and his development as a composer"
1,Terrible,"After reading the reviews I was very excited about reading this book.It was just awful. No character development or plot, and turgid writing. If anyone else had written this it would not have been published.For the past 10 years or so the books that won the Booker prize have been bad bad bad.BTW for all those reviewers who claim that the only people who don't like the book are dimwits, I have a PhD, and read 4-5 books/month (usually not junk)."
2,great cd,i never was a nivea fan until i discovered animalistic it is a good cd very much my taste in music it should have been out in the united states it would have sold a lot of copies i love this cd and the style of the cd so i say it is a great buy for anyone
2,Works that deserve more attention beautifully played,"The opening sonata is one of Mozart's great inspirations, conveying great depth of feeling in a relatively brief time. The performance conveys its greatness and is worth the price of the issue by itself. Nothing is overplayed or underplayed. Perhaps there are other approaches that would work as well, but this is outstanding--and in fact one of my favorites from this label."
2,Recommended,"Great, vibrant colors in a very usable palette. Blends easily in fondant, icing and marcipan alike. Just a tiny drop is sufficient for an entire batch, which makes it extremely cost efficient. Shipped and delivered in Norway after just three days."
1,ONLY Half Science-fiction---Don't Bother Reading It,"Book launches into the exciting story only in the 1st half of the bk when the message was almost deciphered. I hated all that reading thru all that boring character & city description (some may find this intriguing) about the characters just to get to the real, important plot about egression. This is the kind of bk that mixes realistic fiction & science fiction. It is supposed to be the latter, but it feels so much like the former. I am a science-ficiton/fantasy purist reader & nothing else. That's why this bk deserves a lower grade. It contains no excitement for me, no matter how well the charcters are developed, when the momentum of the story is just as weak as the superdull realistic fiction part of it."
1,Negative,"I'm Not Talking About My Rating (Although Almost), I'm Talking About His Movie Comments. He Barely Says Anything Good About A Certain Movie And Writes Negative Comments That Diminishes His Good Comments. If You Read This Book, Watching Movies Will Become A Horrible Experience For You. It's Good That The Book Has The List Of Actors And Such Related To The Movies Rated But That Cannot Even Save The Book From The Feeling You'll Get If The Book Becomes An Essential To You. Film Buffs Should Try To Put This Idea In Perspective."
2,Smart Strip LCG5 energy saver bar,"Smart Strip LCG5 Energy Saving Power Strip with Autoswitching Technology and Modem/Coaxial Surge ProtectionI bought three and fitted them to our two computer systems and to the Home Theater. So far, really, really good. Saves so much messing about with switches and remotes as everything now works with one ""action"" and the things we want left on all the time, just go into the appropriate places on the bar. Can't say how much energy it all saves as we have solar electric feeding into the Utilities power system, but these days, every penny helps!"
1,Works Great for a few months....then croaks!!!,"This is truly an impressive joystick/throttle combination. I was overjoyed when I got this as a gift. It worked great for the first few months of use. Unfortunately, the system fell into disrepair, mainly because of poor quality pots. This is a common problem with these units. After spending an entire day taking apart the throttle and cleaning the pots with jewelers glases, reinstalling the firmware and finally giving up, I am looking for a replacement. It REALLY BUGS ME to see what was spent on this item and see how shabbily it was constructed. LET THE BUYER BEWARE !!!"
2,Synergy,"This book bore fruit in coordinating the development of two jostling threads in my life, spiritual and entrepreneurial maturity.It encourages one to blow on the embers of the 'best self' at all levels of the productive community. It points to pragmatic rewards from increasing the participation of the productive partners. It achieves this through diverse case studies and a thoughtful distillation of principles.I appreciated the insights into the nature of successful leadership. The review of qualities and challenges facing managers helps to de-mystify their task. We see the onging premium on vision, commitment, re-inventiveness. As a small business owner I felt stretched, inspired, and more compassionate toward my own efforts."
1,Dont buy,This is a very difficult thing to put together I have literally put together real engines easeyer than this the enigine does not go together like a real one nothing fits right and does not make any sense over all it's a pice of crap save your money
1,Under the Lake lacks imagination,"I recently finished Under the Lake by Stuart Woods. I was so disappointed. I knew that this is one of his older books, so I am willing to give him some leeway...but oh my...what a disappointment. The story line was somewhat interesting, but he characters were so unbelievable. Running from a drug dealing crooked cop and you take a nap??? Seeing ghosts in your house and you aren't even concerned??? Every woman you meet ends in a sexual conquest??? Researching a possible mass murder, complete with incest and dirty cops and you are torn by your responsibility to write about a Chicken Franchise owner??? Please...was this a mystery or a comedy. I recently bought three other books by Stuart Woods but I'm afraid to even start them."
2,Review on Gift - Falconry,"I purchased this book as a gift for a falconry enthusiast. I cannot personally address the content, but I can relay highly positive comments from the recipient."
2,it works,"my sister has one she paid a LOT more for. this one is fine, works great, but is not as bulky as my sisters. It works the same and is a lot less expensive"
2,"Brilliant, classic, my favorite jazz piano CD","Technically and harmonically Rahn Burton is up there. The breadth of different jazz piano styles that Rahn plays on the CD is panoramic. It is a brilliant work, the culmination of a lifetime of living the life of a full time working jazz piano professional. I have seen Rahn Burton in person on two ocasions when he was accompanying a jazz singer as part of a workshop for singers. He is known among singers as a ""singers' pianist"" because he has a gift for bringing out the best in a singer. He's really good."
2,Map skills,"Teachers, if you want to turn a lesson on map skills into a fun activity, this is the book to do it with. Easy text with great illustrations (map inserts in every page) can be turned into a ""map chase"" around the world in the classroom."
1,Pure unadulterated garbage,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this...! My third-grade cousin is far more skilled at plot development than Weisberger will ever be....if you're really in the mood for an expose, just reread Nanny Diaries - trust me, it will be far more satisfying."
2,I gave this book to my mother immediately,I love this book. I read it in one sitting. I am a therapist who has had a troubled relationship with my parents all my life. Reading this book was so helpful to me in terms of being able to discern how I need my parents to treat me now that I am grown. I have had a hard time articulating to them why their behavior pushes me away rather than brings me closer. Reading this book helped me identify my needs. And then I gave a copy to my mother! She is reading it now and I expect it will really help her know how to love me. The author is so non-shaming that I felt comfortable giving it to my mother and I think she will be able to let in the information. I have also allready used this book with my clients. The book market contains almost nothing on adult child/parent relationships. Thanks to the publishers and author. Roberta Maisel is a very wise and compassionate woman.
2,Fantastic book,"Everything I've made from this book has been delicious. I use it all the time. I don't think the ingredients are exotic! From reading the other customer reviews you can tell that the title should have emphasized the mediterranean aspect more but if super healthy delicious food is what you like, you'll like this book."
2,"It works well, and fits my child wonderfully!","I recently had a car accident, and had to have my car seats replaced. What a drag? At amazon.com, it was without stress. I just scrolled through the site and found my car seat. In a different color of course. Who would pick the same color that had an accident. Sort of bad luck I suppose. But purple is also a girls color, as much as pink is. To those that choose this model, the head rest raises & lowers by twisting the knobs on the sides. So as your child grows, the head rest goes up as he or she gets taller. A#1 good purchase in my book. Happy window shopping."
1,i still cant speak spanish,"it is a smart system that is very helpful, but my eyes strain to read the print. also if your like me you want to be able to carry on conversations in spanish, granted i still have 2 cds left to finish out of the 13, but the fluency isnt there. i read one review after i bought it that seems true saying - theyre biggest sin is they dont tell you the final 2 volumes are not for sale. in other words i cant go any further with this system, and now have to try to start a new one to obtain my spanish goals. in some cases the grammar gets tricky and they say dont worry about that, we'll cover it in level 3, but show me where on the internet or anywhere for that matter to buy level 3 or 4. you cant its impossible. give them credit im smarter than before though."
2,It tight for two,"It works as it states. Very easy to install. But, if you've 2 large bikes, then it well take some arrangment to get them to fit on the rack. But, I am very happy with the product and looks"
2,Best USB drive out there!,"This USB drive was given to me as a gift and I love it! I use it every day!...btw, I accidentally left it in my pants before throwing them in the washer and my USB drive still works PERFECTLY and my data was fully protected!!..I would recomend purchasing this USB over any other!"
2,Yes! It is finished!,"Excellent book to help us fix our eyes upon Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith! Praise God from who all blessings flow!"
1,Does not warm coffee!,My sister had received this item as a wedding gift last March. I went to visit her and I absolutely loved it. As soon as I came home I ordered one for myself. Mine does not make warm or keep coffee warm. Will contact customer service...I hope they repair it since it's only been three months since I purchased!
1,Magazines are NOT Books!!!,"This is described as a ""Paperback"", which refers to books. This is not a book; it's a magazine. Magazines should be specified as ""magazines"", and not many people know that ""Wildlife Art News"" is a magazine. If you are looking for a book, you've found the wrong thing. This is a MAGAZINE!!!"
2,A plain truth,"I read all books by Mark Rashid. He is gifted in many ways, and one is writing readable books. This booh is IMHO all about attitude. To be a passive leader is something which is in your nature. It will be hard for me to change it. But I will try my best. This book is defintely a must read for everyone who is into understanding horses and working with them. It will open yet another door on how to work better with your horse(s)."
2,"NP20 Battery ""jump start"" worked like a champ","Just tried the NP20 ""jump start"" and it worked like a champ, my battery is now charging and I won't have to buy a new one. Just need to remember to keep it charged and remove from camera if not going to use it for a while....."
2,STR has cranked out a wall of vitriolic noise,"With Martin Bisi at the knobs, STR has cranked out a wall of vitriolic noise that rivals the most cacophonic moments of Jesus Lizard. Indeed, most of the grungy melodic trappings of that first disc have been completely forgotten, leaving only the bitter taste of fear and disgust.Which is where Season to Risk wallows best. Bisi captures a big chunk of the band's live energy and caterwauling moments, and the songs are just as mean this time around. I think STR always knew its niche, and this album places the boys right there, dead center. A fine piece of workmanship, though to catch the full experience you still must see these guys live"
2,"If you think you should read this later, read this now.","Simply put, this book is what made me think about my past. Why I didn't do certain things, and what lead me to be where I am right now. I noticed procrastination as a HUGE pattern, something that I need to overcome.Since you're reading this, you are contemplating already. If that is the case, you probably have an issue (especially if you say things like ""Man, I don't have time to read this book now.. I'll get it later when I have more time"". Hint: you won't)The book tells you a lot of things, from the psychology of why we do it and gives some hints on how to overcome it. It will tell you that you won't be able to do from a Monday to Tuesday, but that it is a gradual process.I loved it, I really did, and I give my absolute recommendation for the book!"
1,she's overdone,"All in all, I'm glad I read this book as a study in popular fiction. Would I recommend this title to another reader looking for modern fiction? NO. So many people have been raving about the fact that a man can write a book about a woman and make it seem so real. Well, it hasn't happened yet. I found it difficult to make it through this sucking swamp of a book. The title character did not ever truly improve, she just changed the circumstances of her life every so often. As for the author being able to write as a woman, not true. I found Dolores to be shallow, and many of her actions to be little more than what can be found in a typical male's perception of how a female should act in certain situations. It is a depressing morass of every bad thing that can happen to a soul."
1,Hard to get the cubes out,"I bought those to make baby food, and don't like them. It's near impossible to get the cubes of food out (only tried bananas and carrots). I'll stick to the regular boring plastic trays that work. Oxo make a great tray with a sliding top that keeps odors out of the baby food."
1,Pen Doesn't work,"Would love to try the two sets of Hot Dots we now own, but the pen does not work. I'd return it and order another one, but the previous reviews make it seem doubtful it's worth it. Too bad because it seems like a good concept. Now I have these useless cards and a pen that doesn't work."
1,Not Worth The Money,I was disappointed in this book. I found the ideas in the book very old fashioned and most often ugly. Th only good thing about the book is at the back of the book she shows how to make each seperate flower. But the craft ideas are a DEFINITE pass.
1,Can't believe she wrote this book,The characters were never really developed and the story line was not believable. I can't believe Carr wrote this book. I enjoyed her others but this one was a bummer. If you must read it buy it second hand and save as much money as possible. I will not be keeping this in my collection.
1,Hunting Evil,"I would like to share with everyone my thoughts about this book. I think that Carlton Smith is a very lowsy writer. He never interviewed me or ""Charloette"". He never interviewed my mother or james either. I didn't even find out about this book until 3 months after it was published. I would like everyone to know that I feel that my rights were violated because in the 2nd paragraph on page 179, my real name was printed. Being that I am a minor at the age of 16, I do believe that is against the law.As far as accuracy, it was very accurate (the events where i was victimized) I also don't understand why this book was written before the trial. I am the daughter of Michelle Michaud and I know how ""Evil"" she really is. She goes beond the meaning of that word."
2,Awesome cd!,"I love the hits from this time and was excited to get this cd, and being that it contained some songs that really brought back some good memories, I was very excited to purchase this. The price was excellent, and shipped right away. I am listening to it now and just enjoying reliving those memories! Definitely a great purchase, and i will buy from this seller again."
1,Save your money and your sanity,"I bought the full McAfee Security Suite 2006 and then couldn't get it to register, which meant I couldn't get any updates, making the software worthless. The McAfee support people weren't able to help me despite many hours on the phone, plus their ""fixes"" messed up my computer so horribly that I had to reformat my hard drive. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for protection."
1,Don't Purchase This Item,"Don't purchase this item, the hose is cheap and thinned walled so it collapses under suction and very difficult to get it to work. When it does, the hose is collapsing on itself so it takes forever to siphon. Total rip off!"
1,The 'People Magazine' of Science,"I was so excited to receive this magazine and found its one-to-three paragraph 'ditties' and glib treatment of its nicely varied subject matter abysmal, just awful. This publication seems to have minimal substance and depth, and treats its topics as ""Fun Facts."""
1,Pay others to watch it!!,"This was worst made film made by filmmakers who had the benefit of seeing other films and reading Sci-Fi material. If this film had been made 40 years ago, it would be worthy of praise. In the light of what we know about making Sci-fi movies and actors and filmmakers and people with money and time who have been to the movies , it was a waste of time making it and of those who watched it. This is not good Sci-fi. Everything was bad, the way people talked , died ,ran, hurryed along, drove, acted. The screenwriter was deaf and blind to how people talk and act. The special effects and CGI showed they had time and money."
2,"""Bridge To Terabithia"" A Real Tear Jerker","Jess Aaron's number one goal was to be the fastest runner in the fifth grade. He's been practicing all summer long. On the first day of school, a new girl named Leslie Burke wants to run. Gary Fulcher said that no girls were allowed to run. Jess gets Gary to let her run by saying that he's afraid to let a girl run. Now she was the fastest. She and Jess become very good friends. They make their own country where they were the only ones allowed. The name of the country is Terabithia. They have to swing on a rope across a creek to get to there secret country. The ending? You will have to find that out for yourself. I think the book was okay. I did not like the book as much as i thought I would. I would recommend this book to people with emotions and a lot of imagination. The ending is real sad and almost brang a tear to my eye."
2,Full of interesting information.,"When i bought this book, it took me awhile to get into it, but once i started reading it more frequently, i wasnt dissapointed. It goes into great detail explaining anything and everything that you could think of in the Wheel of Time universe. I definately recommend this book if you are a fan of Robert Jordan's extremely popular books. It tells you the past of all the forsaken, and goes into great detail about all of the major and minor lords/ladies and lands in which they control. Definately a must for any WoT fan!"
1,Why is it called The Jury?????????????,Someone explain to me why it is called The Jury. I looked at the cover and wondered if my book's insides had been exchanged leaving the title? I can't see a connection. This book is a too-drawn-out legal story that really drags in the last fourth.
2,A Good First Novel - Hope To See More in the Future,"Craig Dirgo has written a fast-paced and entrtaining first novel. ""The Einsten Papers"" has an interesting storyline and several subplots which he ties together very nicely. I would agree to some extent with the critic who gave this book 2 stars that he has used to a fair extent the writing style of his co-hort, the great Clive Cussler. But I do not think that is a bad thing. Clive Cussler writes terrific adventure stories! Is that a bad thing? Isn't that what we want?A criticism I have of the book is that the main characters (Taft and Martinez) aren't really developed very well. They just kind of show up and do their thing. But I suspect if Mr. Dirgo continues to use Taft and Martinez in future books, we'll get to know them like Mr. Cussler's Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.But overall, Craig Dirgo has shown he can tell a good story. I hope we'll see more of his work in the future!"
1,Superficial,"I am a LP fan, but after been living in Israel for almost 3 years I have to say that this guide is very superficial. It could be much better ... for example, there are restaurants that everybody know in Israel, very popular, very nice that are not mentioned in the guide. I would expect something more from LP ... sorry :("
2,TMX Elmo will make anyone laugh!,This toy is great! I purchased it for a mother's day gift. It was a hit! We laughed with Elmo all day. I think this toy would brighten anyone's day regardless of age or gender!
1,"Power of technology, related to emotions","What happens in a modern society if a light attached to your forehead indicates when you are in love with somebody else? An original idea for a funny novel. Unfortunately the book is a little bit to long, with many unnedeed secondary stories. Suggested to people who still believe UK is a great world empire!"
1,Not as good as the Original Armada,"Unlike Armada most of the graphics are quite poor. The colors aren't as vivid, the animations aren't as spectacular, and there just seems to be way too much to the game. I'm all for having to manage resources in an RTS, but having to manage five different resources which come from five different sources can be pain staking and VERY annoying in online gaming. There is allot more to manage... probably too much.If you want a good StarTrek RTS go for the original Armada. It's cheaper, it looks better, and a lot of people still play it online.If you want a more complicated StarTrek game that involves a lot of management then for for StarFleet Command I."
1,Discovery Ball????,After playing with this toy for a few minutes I realized that I was beyond this toy. This toy is NOT for adults at all. I found myself very bored and not discovering anything I didn't already know.
2,Mystical World,"I enjoyed the time it took to finish the game with the depth of mazes, and puzzles. This is a game that does not offer instant gratification, but is enjoyed over a number of days. The puzzles make sense, and the worlds fit together nicely.Recommended and enjoyed for all gamers looking to add some adventure to their summer days."
2,Schumacher knows his stuff,"Schumacher showed he had vision by purchasing real estate in the burgeoning market of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach years ago. With this book, he continues to show the same vision he started his career with."
2,Great PROMO Single!,"This was a great promo single that was given out at BORDERS. This cd has two amazing songs from the album ""What if It All Means Something?"". Both tracks are the album versions of these songs. While the songs themselves are great, the value for this single isn't. Unless you are a hardcore completist, Check out the full album for an addition 8 songs by chantal!"
1,disappointment,I ordered this Loving Family Kid's Bedroom set as a Christmas present for my Niece. They shipped a different room set and now my Niece has to exchange it. Very disappointed that the item ordered was not the item shipped to my Niece!
2,Don't watch sausage or health policy being made!,"An enlightening and dispiriting account of the rise and fall of President Clinton's health care reform plan. Broder and Johnson interviewed all the principals, from President Clinton and Hillary Clinton down to uninsured individuals dealing with serious health problems. Diagnosis: Change the U.S. health care system to provide all Americans with access to basic health care. Prescription: Massive federal program to expand the health insurance market and control costs. Outcome: An arrogant and inexperienced White House staff unwilling to compromise, faced with well-organized and vehement opposition from Republican lawmakers and a variety of special interest groups, led to stalemate"
1,Not worth the money....,"These earrings were quite pricey for being ""simulated"" pearls. They were also a darker shade of champagne than what I expected them to be. I purchased these to wear to a wedding and now that I've seen them, I'm not sure that I'll even wear them. I was looking for something that appears ""classy"" but these appear somewhat ""gawdy"". I'm not impressed at all."
1,Spice World,I thought this move was not that great. I think that they give a not so good influence to kids. Look at what they wear. It's horrible. I don't think any kid should want to grow up to be like that.
1,Watch Out,"I got this item for my birthday just after Christmas and was really excited to get it up and running. i was immidiatly disappointed for inside the box there was no software and no manual. I was able to use the iomega website to get music loaded, now take it to the gym for a good workout. However, I could not get the thing to run off of the battery. The battery will not take a charge apparently. It is difficult to tell since there is no icon on the screen telling you that the thing is hooked up at all, or how much charge is in the battery. This item seems to be a complete bust, too bad, it had tons of promise. Try to avoid buying one."
2,Great Read!,This is a wonderful story that amazes one about the bravery of individuals during WWII. Some of the story details put you in the place of the spy and give you a sense of how scared she must have been. I do a lot of WWII reading and cease to be amazed how Jews and other races were treated by the Nazi regime.
2,Pretty awesome CD,This CD offers 7 songs that are in my taste. the best song there is in this CD in my opinon is All Hail Shadow. Crush 40 did it very well from Shadow the Hedgehog game. of couse someone else did it on the game but its good for me to have two different parts to the song. Here are my rates to the songs.#1 His world: 9-10 would get a 10 but the song goes over and over and doesnt really have any other part to it...#2 My dream of absolution: 10-10 Awesome! techno is in here#3. All hail Shadow: 10-10: like i said great song!#4: Argh! why must a girly song be in here... Sonic...why?!#5.: Same as 1 only FASTER! totally Sonic's style! 10-10!#6.: same as 2 only better! more techno-y!! 10-10#7: same as 1 and 5 only has a totally DIFFERENT locals. better then 1 i say but not as better as 5 10-10
1,NOT for color treated hair,This shampoo was harsh on my fine hair when it was uncolored. I tried it again now that it is colored hoping (after buying this large bottle) that it would work better on colored hair. Left my hair looking and feeling like frizzled straw. Fortunately have a good shampoo now that is keeping my color safe and my hair looking glossy and soft.I gave this to my husband to use (truly doesn't care what goes on his head as long as it cleans :>)) and he doesn't like it either. His thick healthy hair looks bushy and unruly when done. Off to the trash it went.
1,THis isn't even a CD ....,"STEVE made such a horrible album, and tells everyone that it is one of the best ever produced by Maiden... How ? It has a horrible singer ( correction: a good singer caught in a band losing its creative genius ), a barely tolerable second guitarrist (Janick Gers), some incredibly lousy songs (like ""2 A.M."" and ""BLOOD ON THE WORLD'S HANDS"") and a pair of songs identical to each other !!!! I tought this was the bottom for Maiden, until ""VIRTUAL ELEVEN"" came out and it was worse !! But ""BRAVE NEW WORLD"" put things in place ocne and for all... (Although not being a masterpiece)"
1,A glaring inaccuracy,"Newton claims FBI profiling has never led to the arrest of any serial killer. Apparently he's never heard of David Meirhofer, a serial killer in Montana who was arrested in 1974 as a direct result of an FBI profile. He was the first serial killer to be caught via profiling, and I seriously doubt he was the last.With such a obvious error, anything Newton says is suspect to me."
1,That can not be food.....,"I bought this for my 4 yr old. I hid it from her after the second time she used it. I have no idea what is in those mixes, but it is the most foul tasting thing I've ever had. My daughter and I spend a lot of time in the kitchen and I've put up with some of her nasty tasting experiments for the sake of her self-esteem. There was no disguising my distate as I was running for the bin. The utensils/pans are worth keeping to play with, but I would suggest you find other uses for the food. P.S. The dog will NOT eat them."
1,This is an abridged version!,"This 116 page version from BN Publishing is NOT the complete Master Key System. It is an abridged version and is not worth buying. I went to the library and checked out the ""real"" book, which is more like 400+ pages. This book is barley 110 (plus 6 pages of ads in the back!). Look at the page count before ordering. Maybe I'm missing something, but there really should be a big, bold warning that this version is totally abridged. I've never seen a book so different from the original.It is ridiculously short, has no flow in the text (basically there are numbered paragraphs) and absolutely not the same as the original text. I don't really understand, actually, why it got published with the same name or why the reviews on here are so wonderful. I'm thinking maybe amazon uses the same reviews for all versions? Anyway, be sure to look at the page count before ordering and don't buy this one."
1,Gulliver's Travels,I was bored watching Jack Black's performance in this movie. A waste of money and time. But for $1.99 I'm glad I didn't spend $9 at the movies.
1,Flattens to nothing,"I bought this pillow with the idea that it would give support during sleep. It doesn't. The pillow flattens down to more than a regular pillow does, leaving no support at all. Don't buy this pillow."
2,A Great CD!,"What can I say? It's only a matter of time until these guys are nationally known. All you have to do is listen to the first song, ""Lost in America,"" and you'll be hooked. They have their own folk/rock sound with intelligent lyrics. If you like Dylan, Van Morrison, Billy Pilgrim, Indigo Girls, Gin Blossoms, Counting Crows, or Springsteen, you'll love this CD (although their sound is somewhat different than any of the above). They should have a new CD coming out later this year so be on the lookout for that one as well."
1,Not As Great As It Sounds.,"If you're planning on using this much as a radio, think again. The reception on trains (over land) is terrible. The reception at work (in an interior office) is worse. XM Customer Service will tell you that you have to sit next to a south-facing window for optimal reception. As an MP3 player, it's okay -- as long as you don't have a vast iTunes library. It doesn't work with iTunes at all, and the software that Samsung provides is for PC only. Just my opinion."
2,Awesome Movie!!! Must Watch!,I watch a lot of movies and this is definitely a great movie to see. I'm not usually into action movies but this is a must-see movie!! Great actors and amazing storyline filled with tons of futuristic scenery!
1,no longer a fan.,"I own all the previous sets, plus all of Frost, Morse, Last Detective, Waking the Dead, etc. Obviously a brit mystery fan, but sadly, this will be my last ""Midsomer."" This set is dark to the point of weirdness; the Sargeant is bland and boring (bring back Sgt. Troy!); and while Joyce and Calley appear, they are extraneous and muted. Even DCI Barnaby seems tired and quite honestly, not very bright or insightful! The whole pace seems markedly different, and not in a good way. VERY disappointed. If you have been a fan, try borrowing this set - not worth owning. Unlike previous sets, this one will NOT be re-watched by this family of adults."
2,Perhaps the Greatest Dave Brubeck ever,"I love Dave Brubeck, but this album is far and away the finest. The Paul Desmond cuts are superb. ""The song is you"" is my favorite."
1,Fire Flesh,"The book the Skeleton Man by Joseph Bruchac, was the worst book I have ever read. In the book a girl suddenly looses her parents, and she now has to find a family menber to take care of her. A strange uncle she has never heard of comes and claims her. He reminds her of a story her dad told her, about a man who burnt his finger and then he ate all the flesh on it and slowly burnt all his flesh. Unless you enjoy the fact of people eating there flesh you wouldn't enjoy this book. Also the girl talks to a rabbit. Weird. Don't read the book the Skelton Man by Joseph Brachac."
2,The perfect book to climb the corporate ladder,I was given the title of this book at a seminar I attended. This was the best investment for my career. No school can teach you how to play the game the way this book does. I love the way Mr. Coleman puts the language of the book in very simple terms. If you are intersted in getting ahead in your company follow the rules that Mr. Coleman lays out and you will be in management/upper management in know time.
1,Please stop the remakes,"$70 million to whack out the head of the FBI? The Russian gangsters in this clinker obviously don't shop around for hired killers. As if hearing Gere's Irish accent isn't bad enough, we must bear two hours of Bruce Willis' deadpan wig-changing killer. Argh! And why won't a rifle, a bomb, poison, something a BIT simpler be employed as the murder weapon? What's with that gun? This film is ridiculous, period."
1,Disappointed in Product,"We bought this days ago, and it is already going back. An impromptu stop at the store for a walker for my 10mos old to take on vacation so he wouldn't be cruising all the furninture at grandma's house. After three kids, I was missing the old ones I had for the other two, but was tempted because of its simplicity and ""no battery"" thing...let me break it down:*time consuming assembly, had to hunt down screwdriver*it tipped over immedietly as the baby pulled himself up, so it only worked when I held on to either him or the front of the walker, making this not an independent toy*within minutes mailslot doors came off*now have to hunt for ""mail"" so it can all go back to the store*the ""adjustable"" traction worked on some floors in our home, but not all of themon the plus side, it doesn't run on batteries, is pretty basic and the baby loved playing with the mail slots while the doors stayed on. Either way, I am returning it and getting a different activity walker for him."
1,Can't start a lawn mower - won't trust it for a car,"My toddler turned the on ignition for my lawn mower while sitting at the controls - week later, battery was dead. Even with a full charge, the Black and Decker could barely turn over the little 19HP, two cylinder motor. Luckily I was able to push the tractor out of the shed and use traditional jumper cables.Lesson learned - never buy a cheap imitation of a commercial product. Black and Decker will slap their name on just about anything, but why spend money on the brand? I'd prefer to spend money on the product."
1,Not good,I had a problem with this VCR it would not transfer some VCR tapes to DVD. Appears to be a commom problem with the machine. The seller promptly refunded my money.
1,Do Not Buy This!!!!,I Would Not Recommend Any One To This Product! I Have Order This Product And They Haven't Came In The Mail Its Been For Ever And Still Havent Got Them!
2,All my favorite British actors/actress' in one neat package,"I laughed, I cried, then I laughed again.Really good movie, enjoyable and I was able to share with my friends, as well.I had rented from RedBox, and felt it deserved a spot on my shelf, where I could watch it again....and again."
1,X-rated,"I was a fan of Greg Behrendt TV show and was disappointed when it was removed from the air. I bought this DVD based on my experience from the show, but was disappointed with his comedy. It is sorta vulgar comedy with Greg saying the F... word many times in his dialog. I just don't appreciate this type of comedy and don't find it very funny. Sorry, Greg. I hope he gets a show back on television."
2,Back to Basics Toaster & egg cooker,This is the 3rd time we have purchased this same type of toaster so -obviously we like it. The first 2 were the 1 egg cooker type. The last one cooks 2 eggs at a time and 4 pieces of toast. They do not last very long . We are hopeful that this one will last longer. Hang on to your receipt.Back to Basics TEM4500 4-Slot Egg-and-Muffin Toaster
2,Nice camera; nice price,"This Olympus camera has a good feel, produces a good picture, and is easy to use. What's not to like?"
1,snow cone maker,When I got the snow cone maker the door was broke and it had a crack down the side not happy but keep it n e ways cause I needed it the day after I recived it or I would've sent it back
1,Broke in 10 minutes!,"My son got this for his third birthday. It took 10 minutes to put it together and it fell apart when I was putting it on the floor for him to look at. The saw stopped making cutting noises and when I called the manufacturer they said that was a ""common problem"" and didn't have any in stock to replace it because they had sent out too many for holiday replacements. That was a huge red flag. It's been two weeks - the walls fall off, the saw still doesn't work, the roof is broken... And my son had played with it all of about 3 times. Don't waste your money!"
2,Jack-In-The-Box,"Stanley Kubrick's epic The Shining is one of the twentieth century's underrated films. The acting and cinematography work together flawlessly in this monumental work of excellence. By the way, when Jack is swinging an AXE or a GOLFCLUB he swings like a Rusty Gate."
2,A writer is forced to bring a charachter back by a crazy fan,"I always knew Misery was a kidnapping sort of film. It is my first Stephen King book. I used to think it was about a woman who poisoned a writer and locked him in a room like jail. Boy was I in for a suprise! The movie was good but as they say,the book is always better. I give Misery a 10 out of 10"
1,Disapointing,"This is great if your into Edgar Cayce. If your not into him, dont get this book. It is mostly filled with Cayce's prophecies, not with a more scholarly approach. I was looking for more Egyptological content. But hey that's me.."
1,Terrible format,"I returned this item because the book format was awkardly and unnatractively wide for the height.Too bad, because otherwise it's a lovely edition."
1,poor movie,After the first one expectations were raised for the Dead Man's Chest. However it was rather dissapointing and the only bright spot of the movie was Johny Depp- and the stars go to him. The visual effects were not bad but the plot was poor.
1,seller doesnt ship to my country,"i want to buy this dvd,but the seller doesnt ship to my country,i dont know why make this type of restriction.only to make limited the business."
1,Not really a programming book - For beginners only,"This book has the wrong title, it should be called ""SQL Server 2000 Basics"". The word 'programming' should definitely be taken away from the title as only about 1/3 of the book deals with programming, in just the most basic way. This book is just an intro to SQL Server, nothing too detailed. For someone that knows nothing about SQL Server, you will learn the basics here, but you will need to buy other books to get the details."
1,dissapointment,"On receiving this CD audio for the wedding I found that the first CS to the set is missing It was stated that this CD audio was in good to excellent condition BUT how can that be it is an incomplete set, I hesitate to buy anything used again for fear of something like this happening."
1,does not ship in 24 hrs,"i ordered this for my son because the site said ships in 24 hrs. i ordered on dec. 16 it was shipped on dec. 23 and was received on dec. 30.where i learned to tell time, it would have been shipped on dec. 17. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE YOU NEED THE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Alarming,"I am a long time advocate of taking care of our earth, and this DVD made me get into gear to try and do more to be part of the solution, and not the problem. Global warming can be corrected, but we all need to do as much as we can to make it work. Even if all some of us can do right now is take ""baby steps"", we must take them, and ""grow up"", and grow aware!"
1,Brought from A&R Photo Video Inc and recieved wrong product.,"I read that Adorama sent generic adapter rings instead of the Bower ones shown in the image and description, so I purchased the product from A&R Photo Video Inc and they ALSO sent a generic adapter ring instead of the Bower one. It is very unethical when a customer sees the description and picture of a product, trusts the store that they will send the one shown officialy, and the store sends a different one that the customer never chose to buy. There cannot be a distrust between customer and store, but in this case there is one, so I will never buy again from A&R Photo Video Inc."
2,Great cd,David Meece is one of my favorite artist. This cd has a lot of great songs with a great message.
1,Couldn't even finish it,"I read the back of this book, and thought, ""what a cool idea for a book"". Then started trying to actually read the book, and the execution just didn't live up to the idea. I got through about a third of the novel and then just returned it to the library. The main characters are unlikable and boring, and most of the first part of the book is the heroine's internal dialog. Didn't even care how this one ended - I just wanted a truck to hit them and put everyone out of their misery."
1,Run from this movie!!,"Okay first of all I am an avid horror movie buff and I have seen almost every horror movie made. And as in all horror movies you have to suspend your belief and just go with the story wherever it goes. This movie is so poorly written and so obvious and on top of that completely preposterous. I should just tell you what happens and save you the time and money of seeing this train wreck, but that might bore you to the verge of suicide. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!! This is the problem with the After Dark movie line. Some are brilliantly written and are quite entertaining, but not this one. You have been warned!!"
2,The Little prince,The Complex and Simple issues of the Human relation in a Book For Children. You Must find it
2,Rock ON,"The CD was enjoyable to listen to. Most times you purchase to have one or two songs, however this CD only had one song that wasn't great but you didn't fast forward"
2,Easy to assemble,"I haven't actually used the stroller yet, as I'm still waiting for my baby to arrive. But, I got this item as a gift and I had it put together within 10 minutes without looking at the owners' manual. It's very user-friendly."
1,THIS IS THE MOST ONE SIDED BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"Not only did Loren Christensen totaly forget the traditional skinhead, or the roots so deeply embeded in the working class. He forgot to mention that these misled youth are not skinheads at all, its just a title that the media and himself like to pin on these kids because they dont know much more than that. I wouldnet have even gave this boo one star but thats as low as i was allowed to go."
2,"""Wag the dog""- is everything true what U see in the media??","The movie ""Wag the dog"" is directed by Barry Levinson in 1997. In the movie are starring dustin Hoffamnn, Kirsten Dunst and robert De Niro. The movie is a comical satire.the movie is about an reelection from the president of the USA- the only problem is that he had an sexual affair with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.The crewfrom the president want to make that the president will be reelected because of this they think about how they can do it. They go to a producer; with his help they have an idea: war against Albainia only or the election.with this they influence the american people.If U want to know more buy the movie.....In my opinion it is a good film becaus eit shows in what way the american people(not only they- everybody) can be influenced by the media.The message is that U don't have to believe everything U see"
1,You've got to be kidding.........,"Someone showed me this tape and right away I knew that it was a phony from the cover. I mean, the guy is wearing a Kung-Fu uniform. Who is he trying to kid? I then saw the tape and started laughing hysterically. The guy was showing essentially one-step karate-type techniques and trying to show that it was Muay Thai somehow. I have absolutely no idea where this guy got his training from, but he was obviously not trained by a Thai instructor nor did he ever train in a real Muay Thai camp. Having myself trained in a real Muay Thai camp, this tape is a complete and hysterical waste of money. Save your hard-earned $$ and go to Thailand or go to Fairtex in San Francisco if you really want to get the authentic Muay Thai experience."
1,Go back to the drawing board please!,"I was very disappointed in this album. It sounds like they just threw something together instead of adding more grooves and flavor to their songs. The only good cuts are Girlfriend/Boyfriend, Yo Love, I Got What You On, Drama, and Finally (the best track). Also they spent too much time trying to create an enhanced CD,(which is off the hook)when they should have add more songs to the album. Overall, I had high expectations for this album. Another Level was clearly better."
2,The Best Game for N64,"One day while in the local Video Game Store I saw this game sitting on the shelf. I read about it on the back and decided to rent this game. Once home, it blew me away. This game is so cool,and by far the best Nintendo 64 game out there. The Worms voices make it humorous while trying to survive while other worms are blowing up the places where you stand. The Concept may sound corny at first (as so I thought) but once you play it you'll love it. I wish I could rate this above a 5, but 5 is the maximum rate you could go. Keep this review in mind when renting or buying a video game. :)"
1,Hilary Duff is talentless.,"We know she is a girl who got a record deal based on her already-present fame, rather than vocal talent.Her voice is horrible, despite the digital altering.And, on top of that, Hilary doesn't even write her own songs (which is a scary thought anyway). Her singing is pretty much monotone; she has a pathetic voice range.Let's just say that she wouldn't stand a chance on American Idol.As for films, she can NOT act. She's nominated for a 2005 razzie award for her contributions (can I even call it that?) to ""A Cinderella Story"" and ""Raise Your Voice"".I feel so sorry for all the little kids who have had to listen to her songs about rain and crap like that, flying away, etc. Hilary Duff is one of the fakest celebrities ever. The only reason little girls like her is because it's TRENDY to like her. Hilary Duff should come clean and fly away![...]"
1,Lasted 12 days!,"When i got the zen micro 12 days ago, i thought it was the greatest thing. I bought the red one from future shop. it even came with the charger which is a $50 option. It was working perfectly. I babied mine. Always kept it inside the plastic case that comes along with it. I put the unit on charge, a few hours later i come back and the unit is frozen. I know it was not the firmware because I had updated it as soon as i got it home. The unit tells me its a hardrive Problem. I would say avoid this unit at all costs."
1,I DEMAND A $3.75 REFUND FOR MY VIDEO RENTAL FEE!,Where do I write to get my money back for wasting it on this.....worthless.....thing?
1,Not for XP - AT ALL!,"Do not get this item for XP Pro!!!!!! I was updating some business machines to Gigabit with these cards. Once the drivers are installed... of the machines that would boot, they ran incredibly slow. Very slow startups and sluggish response. Other machines would just freeze up after a few minutes of operation. I suspected problems when, during the driver install, I got a warning that the driver was not signed or validated for XP and it asked me to either quit the installer or continue. Of course, I installed it anyway and payed the price. It took a good half day to totally get the drivers off the 5 machines that it infested. For me, this is the first instance of reverse Vista where drivers for XP are beginning to not work of even be made. Get the Intel gigabit card which requires no drivers in XP machines. This isn't a slam against Netgear at all because they make great stuff but on this one they dropped the ball for XP users."
2,Great little tuner,"Shipping was super FAST, that is always a plus.The tuner is so small I had a hard time believing it would accept a 1/4 plug... but sure enough it does.The digital face is good and I love how the meter sways just like an analog dial. Lighted arrows tell you which way to tune - green is dead on. Neat features too, like a pitch pipe and cord finder. The only thing I don't love about it is the on/off button. It can easily get pressed when not in use, but I believe it has an auto off feature so the battery life should last quite a while. I like this tuner and plan to buy a couple more."
2,ALL EYEZ ON HIM,"THIS CD IS A MASTERPIECE, CLASSIC, MUST HAVE DOUBLE CD EVER. ONE OF MY FAVORITES. NOW BECOMING RARE, IT IS A MUST HAVE ALBUM. AFTER MAY 1, 2001 (WHEN IT IS RE RELEASED) IT WILL BE HARD TO FIND AFTERWARDS. MUST HAVE IT. IT IS A GREAT TUPAC ALBUM EVER."
1,"Disappointing, dirty, and stopped working after a few months!","I have two dogs who shed a lot so I needed a good pet vacuum. After reading positive reviews I decided to get this one. It worked well the first few times I used it, but then it rapidly began to fall apart. It would constantly clog with hair, forcing me to clean the filters more often than I would like. I had a big problem with dirt and hair getting caught in the upper canister, not going into the removable bottom canister. The vacuum gets incredibly filthy and dust swirls around it every time I turn it on. I find that the detachable pieces did NOT do a very good job of removing hair and the suction in the removable hose seemed especially weak.The vacuum has recently stopped working all together... it won't even turn on now. So frustrating. I haven't even had it for a year."
2,Monster Book,Book is amazing. It has full color pictures from the actual Monster Garage show plus other pictures. It goes into the peoples careers who are fabricating the parts. Overall good value for the price.
2,Selin's Hoppala!,"This product is not delivered to overseas and we live in Turkey. We wanted the product so much, we agreed to pay USD 200 more just to get it delivered home. Even though it seemed like a terrible deal at that time, I'm extremely glad that we did it. It's such a blast to hear my daughter's laughter when she looses herself in her jumperoo. I would suggest this to everyone..."
1,Battery lasts less than 2 hours,I've only had this dvd player for six months. The battery pack is not dependable. I have completely de-charged and recharged the battery. The most time I can get is 1 hour 43 minutes playing time. Not long enough to view most movies. I would not recommend this product.
1,Very dissapointed,I was never able to get this video to finish loading. Highly considering switching to Apple products! Very very dissapointed.
2,great album,"I really like this album. ""So Good"" is a really good upbeat song, ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" is a cool song about a bad relationship about a guy who takes things from them to be cool, ""Confessions"" isn't exactally the best song that could be on the album and Missy Elliot is kinda the backup singer in the song and it's redundant. ""BUGABOO"" is the BEST SONG ON THE WHOLE ALBUM! It has a great beat and is one you will repeat on the album. ""Temptation"" talks about how there's a guy they wan't but they already have boys. The last songs were what made me think twice about giving them 5 stars. The songs have annoying beats upset for the Outro. If you are a DC fan buy this album. I own both albums and the Destiny's Child today hasn't had another album in awhile.i saw them on tour a while ago and they were so awesome."
2,Powerful,"This CD is full of great songs. Martina's voice is excellent!! ""Good Bye"" tops the list for me. It's a great emotional song about saying goodbye to someone. I also think ""There You Are"" is gorgeous. Way to go, Martina!"
2,Great energy!,"The first time I used this for a run, I felt like I had an ACME rocket strapped to my butt. Tastes horrible when you try to dump it all into your mouth at one time, but works great if you mix it into your water bottle. I use it all the time in conjunction with CLIF bars on longer runs."
1,Unbelievably BORING,"This film lost me in the first 5 minutes, but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson's Creek. This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent. And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent. Totally insipid movie."
1,Might be good but.....,This might be a good product but. What size is it? Are the selves adjustable? What is it made of? This and many more questions I would have before I would buy it.
2,goddesses in me,I read this book in Korea. I come to know that I am like Arthemis. I'm surprised by this fact. I'll live so foever. And I'll cultivate my nature of goddesses.
1,This is not good writing,"I could not finish this book. The writing was stilted and generally not readable to me. The plot seemed interesting, but the writing style coupled with the unbelievability of the characters at the beginning of the book left me simply not caring about the story, or characters. You have to have one of three things to make a book readable: Good writing style, good characters or good plot. This book almost had a good plot, but it was buried with poor writing and wooden characters. I do not recommend this book."
1,Riddled with errors,"The commentary does not mesh with the videos or photos. Repeatedly they will be talking about one type of equipment or a person, but the film or picture will be something else entirely. For example, while talking about large shipments of Sherman tanks arriving, they show film of M3 Stuart Light Tanks, when talking about Hurricane IIB ground attack fighters, they are showing P 40s and Spitfires, when talking about several squadrons of B25 Mitchells arriving, they show B-17s, when talking about the use by the Germans of captured Russian 76.2 MM field guns, they have film of German 150mm and 210 mm artillery, when talking about General Alexander arriving to take over, the first picture is of General Horrocks, when talking about the US M2 105 Howitzer being delivered, the film is of early war US 150 mm Howitzers. And so on ad nauseum all through the whole thing, pathetic."
1,Is this for real?,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. I found this book in a $1 box at B&N and decided to get it to send to a kid in one of those chain letter things. After getting home and reading it, I am almost ashamed to send it. The other reviewer's sum-up of the story is perfect. There's nothing to it and the lemmings just act dumb. Don't bother with this one. Its a waste."
1,Scanned from VHS?,"This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version."
1,Don't buy,It didn't work and wasn't damaged by shipping. The company said to send it back then they didn't give another one. After some time they said they were out of them. I didn't get my money back and I don't think anybody should buy from this company!!!
1,I was very disappointed.,"I had wanted a battery operated lighted cosmetic mirror, not electric. There is another company that hasa battery operated one."
1,AWFUL QUALITY!!!,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING A VERY LONG TIME TO FIND THESE MOVIES ON DVD. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. THEY WOULD NOT EITHER PLAY, OR HALF WAY THROUGH THE MOVIE THEY WOULD STOP AND THAT WAS THAT. IF WB WOULD IMPROVE HOW THESE DVD'S ARE FORMATTED, I WILL PURCHASE AGAIN. I WILL BE WATCHING THE REVIEWS IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT EVENT."
2,Now I want one too!,"I bought this for our 16 year old who is dabbling a bit in sewing, it is very well made, much better than a few others of this size I had seen! Their is thick padding and a nice cotton cover too, it folds and unfolds very easily. If you want a small board for small projects, this is the deal!"
2,Babyland=Awesome,"Even though I consider everything by Babyland to be essential, I consider this to be their best ALBUM, in the definitions as albums go, showcasing the intensity and production-skills that Babyland is, to the average listener. Really, the only way to really know how awesome they are is to see them live, which I have done on many an occasion, but yet it seems never enough, and as a result have introduced some friends to the band by dragging them along. The consenses is always the same: they rule. You owe yourself a favor if you have never heard of this band to pick up at least this CD, and then their entire catalog, and to see them live whenever you can. If you cannot do this, you can't say you truly like electronic/industrial/underground/noisedance/fillintheblank music (or as they call it ""electronic junk punk""). If you really need a clue to what it is, think a cross between the best Einsturzende Neubauten and Front 242. Enjoy. :P"
2,"Good read, but maybe too favorable","Recently, I've began reading a series of Presidential biographies. First I read ""Master of the Senate"" which is about LBJ. Next, I decided to read this book about Nixon.I found it to be a good read, although the author seems to make it his mission to rehabilitate Nixon a little too much. He makes guys like John Dean, H.R. Haldeman, and Bob Ehrlicman look like the main villians in Watergate, and gives too much credit to G. Gordon Liddy. It does a good job of following the major events in Nixon's life, and it does lack the anti-Nixon bias that many Americans, myself included, have towards the 37th President.I recommend the book, but I do warn you that it may be a little to pro-Nixon for some people."
2,"Excellent Memoir, great writing","This is one of my favorite memoirs, both for its difficult subject matter and the quality of writing. I couldn't stop reading this book and have since sought out other titles by the author.From the opening chapter you've drawn into the day-to-day obsession of addiction which, in the case of this author, is insidious despite its somewhat mundane appearance. Once she's brought you to the heart of addiction its easy to see how such a creeping and at first seemingly harmless relationship to alcohol can quickly go from social aid to problem crutch to full-blown need.In one of the most thought-provoking parts of the book she compares drinking, or any sort of addiction really, with exaggerated procrastination - an interesting take on addiction that still has me thinking.A must-read."
1,not as good as Mick Martin and Marsha Porter,"I bought this book a few years ago did not like it one bit. I exchanged it after a few days with the Mick Martin and Marsha Porter video movie guide which I have loved ever since. Being into foreign movies for the most part I miss the old categorized by genre format deeply. Leonard Maltin looks good only when compared to Roger Ebert's idiotic book. I just saw the Ballad of Narayama by Shohei Imamura, oooh it was good."
1,"Great visual, Text is gibberish","The cover is a great visual representation of progressions and the relationship between chords.However the text is unclear GIBBERISH.There are a few gems of information deeply buried beneath condescending inferences that you should ALREADY KNOW this, TRUST ME on that, or JUST TRY IT and it will work.This book doesn't teach theory, it CONFUSES an average studentIt would be better to have just the cover and a one page explanation of its usage on the back-that would be worth $5, but at this cost it is not worth it!"
2,Good concert,But live from royal albert hall i much better. nice to have in my collection but not my favorit blu ray
2,I wish it had a charger,"I bought this because a few weeks ago a friend of mine had this exact same camera. I waited until this weekend to buy it....even though it came with double a batteries, I think I should've been warned about how fast it would drain out. Even though I didn't do alot with it, the batteries still ran out in 1 day. Overall I love it! First digital camera I've own.~V~"
2,One of the best ever,"Startin with the front cover, which is awesome, this is a great cd. With the addition of Rick Medlocke & HT, & Owen Hale on drums this cd simply rocks. People have to forget the old band in order to listen to the new one. I've always been a LS fan, but after the crash this band could have just gone away for good, but chose to carry on the name & great sound of southern rock."
2,Squenix brings us Old School RPG Perfection!,"Have you ever played a game where you tought : ""Ah, they should have added this!"" or ""This is painfull they why did they put this in?"" ? Well Dragon Quest VIII is the exact opposite of those games. Everything in this game is perfect... really... They've refined the old-school RPG to create this perfect universe that will keep you hooked for a 100 if not more!!!From game pacing to depth to animation to graphics... it's truly a master piece. Akira Toriyama's character design brings back all my love for Dragon Ball and makes this games an instant crush. The Hero even borrows some character traits from Goku.Overall if you love RPG this is a game to own, no doubt! If you've never been into RPGs then run away from this title. If you were on the borderline of trying one, the learning curve might be steep because you'll be into deep RPG ground but you'll never regret investing your time and money in there!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Few things disappoint me enough to actually write a review. This guide book is a joke compared to others I have purchased for the previous games. I wouldn't be so upset if the web site that it constantly refers to was actually useful. The site isn't searchable, and none of the hints have links to the other sections they reference. About the only useful things in this book are the list of weapons and skills, and the map. Things I would have liked to see, besides actual help and not just codes to look up stuff on the web site, would be a list of weaknesses for the monsters listed in the back, locations for some of the weapons and armor, etc. As the other reviews have stated, there are many online help sites with way more information than this guide and the PlayOnline site combined, and they won't cost you a penny. Save yourself the money, go online and find yourself a few decent walkthroughs. You'll be glad you did."
1,BAD BOX QUALITY,"Today my Star Wars DVD broken at midlle just when i put my DVD back on casethe material used in the the middle of the box it's too Hard.i have very caution with my DVD's almost 100and i never had a trouble like this before.if you wanna buy it go ahead, but don't forget to change the box"
2,Toasty buns,"I purchased this item for my husband's '97 Honda Civic - which, by the way gets 38 mpg on his daily commute! It heats up quicker than the heated seats in our Volvo, has two settings, seems to stay in place and is cushy. We are very satisfied with this item so far."
2,Great CD - the Demenga brothers at the top of their game,"If you don't know about the music represented on this double CD, it's music commissioned as an homage for Paul Sacher, a patron of the arts from Basel, Switzerland, I think? Many top-name 20th century composers wrote for this celebration of his 70th? birthday, and I believe it was originally the idea that Rostropovich would play all this music (it's all for solo cello, except for the Boulez which is 7 cellos)...he's ended up playing some of it, I think, but not all. Most if not all of this music is based on the tone row eSACHERe (es is E-flat in German, and Re is D in solfege). Anyway, this is interesting music with a lot to offer, played superbly by Patrick and Thomas Demenga. Pick this up if you like cello and 20th century music. Maybe not the greatest thing to start with if you know nothing about 20th century music, but it's very unique stuff, and you might like it, you never know. Very highly recommended."
1,Series in Decline,"I found watching 'The Ark' again quite sad. To me it illustrated how much the Doctor Who series under William Hartnell had declined, since its hey-deys in 1964 and 1965.The setting of the story was interesting enough, but somehow the episodes themselves just seemed to drag on. For me however, the worst aspect was the lack of interesting companions for the Doctor. Steven and Dodo were a poor substitute for Barbara and Ian. The actors themselves (Peter Purves and Jackie Lane) just seemed to lack the presence of their predecessors. Without an absorbing enemy to face, this Doctor Who story does not have enough to maintain the viewer's interest.For me the final negative was the use of the same sound effect within the Guardian hall on Refusis, as that used in the first ever Daleks episode. It just made the comparison more stark, that being one between a new and exciting series and one struggling to find its way."
1,Really a children's book,"As a Beagle owner I was intrigued by this title; unfortunately,I couldn't find much info about it, so in my enthusiasm I shelled outthe $.. and ordered it. I'm living overseas so I couldn't check it outat the local bookstore first. The book has 24 pages, which include atitle page,a credit page, a contents page,a glossary page (definingsuch words as 'ancestor"",""bacteria""and qualities"",and an index page.There are exactly 9 pages with little paragraphssuch as aell about Beagles; ""Beagles are Beautiful"", andFamous Beagles"". The photos are not special in any way. So, ifyou are a dog person looking for a serious dog book and willing to paya price..., you should know that this is a child's book -- anexpensive one! Usually amazon.com provides the dimemsions of the bookand the number of pages, but lack of this info can cost you dearly. Icould have bought a much, much better book for much less money, butnow I'm only disappointed."
1,Woefully inadequate both as an introductory text and reference,"This book has few merits. No pun intended.It has a good introductory section on the symptoms of neurological conditions.However, it fails to provide the reader with an approach to diagnosis which is a pitfall for most clerks, interns and neurology and internal medicine residents.Remember always ask yourself WHERE is lesion ( brain spinal cord nerve NM junction or muscle ) and WHAT is lesion ( pathological process with respective differential diagnosis ).This book fails to do this which is inconceivable.As a reference it falls on more than occasion. The sections are incomplete and not comprehensive.There is little on entrapment neuropathy or spinal root problems.I do NOT recommend this text to any medical students ( get lindsay/bone/callender text on neurology and neurosurgery ).Neurology and medical residents should get a subscription to medlink neurology and not waste their time or money on the text."
2,Love this tea!,"Taylors of Harrogate Scottish Breakfast tea is my favorite morning tea. Its strong, clear flavor is just right for that first cup of the day. Awesome tea!"
1,This is the worst DVD player I've ever owned,"- It takes around fifteen seconds (!) to begin viewing a DVD after inserting it- The pause while switching layers on a dual-layer DVD is longer than on other players I've owned- It will randomly freeze while playing audio CDs (this is not a problem with the discs - they are in pristine condition and can be played by any other CD/DVD player in the house)- Front panel buttons are poorly designed (there are no menu navigation buttons, but there's a 'video select' button to switch between outputs? Who uses that more than once a year?) and don't always seem to function as expected (pressing the Power button doesn't seem to do anything while the disc tray is open)."
1,Installation nightmare,"Tried installing on two computers with no luck. Went to Pinnacle website and downloaded driver, still no luck. Clobbered existing USB drivers."
1,Try Again,"I finished ""Back on the Block"" and it was an okay read. I gave it two stars simply because I was able to complete it.I enjoyed Felicia's ""Sins of My Father"" far better."
1,Worth max $10 (including shipping),"I was disappointed with the content. I have other related DVD's as well, but this is the first one in which I was getting bored and waited for the end. I also get the smell that Gardiner try to make the assumption that ""Christianity"" is also a secret society. Watching this one did not really broaden my knowledge.The first one I got was completely faulty and Wholesale DVD America have send me another one free of charge. I wonder if the reproduction are really professional."
2,LRC,"A fantasic testimony of how a typical Jewish man lives his life all over the world, meeting many people who believe in Jesus, and how he finds out that Jesus is more than a Jew, He is the Messiah. Through many debates and personal scriptural studies, he finds out that the Torah is very clear about Who the Messiah is, and how Yeshua (Jesus) is Him. Well written."
1,Disturbingly great? More like disturbingly plodding...,"I had to laugh when I read a review on here that said this film's ""disturbingly great."" The only disturbing thing about WOLF CREEK is how slooooooooow the story moves along. I swear, the first two-thirds of this movie's nothing more than the three no-name leads driving around, mumbling intelligible things that had no bearing on the actual plot.After that, there's a twist, but it feels like everything from that point on is done for shock value and really isn't scary or truly disturbing. It was like the filmmaker wanted this to become the Australian version of TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, but they failed miserably in the effort.If you want to watch a ""disturbingly great"" horror film with a foreign flavor, I suggest you pass on this trite film and check out HIGH TENSION. It's faster-paced, has a better story and has an ending that's a whole heck of a lot more rewarding to the audience."
1,Crackly whenever you move the connector,"It fits nicely, but if you move the connector it crackles. Cheap price, cheap product."
2,Good movie,I rented this from Netflix and decided to order it from amazon. I would like to watch it again. The acting and story are very good. It's actually a tragic story but I guess I like these kind of movies sometimes. It's too bad Natasha Richardon died so young because I thought she was one of the best and natural actresses. She made alot of great movies. So she didn't disappoint me with this one either.
2,super colon cleanse,"I bought this product for the main purpose of cleansing. I find it is very good and starts working in no time. One of the many good things about it, (and my personal favorite), is that I don't get uncomfortable when I have the urge to use the bathroom. I have done many natural cleansers in the past and I have had the experience of being weakened and in gripping stomach pains when I had the urge to use the bathroom with other products.I have been using this along with another cleansing productNUTRAFLUSH PRO (3 Bottles) - The #1 Complete Colon Cleansing and Full Body Detox Cleanse Formula. The All Natural Diet, Weight Loss Cleansercombined with this is quite gentle on the system and yet fast acting. When I am feeling stopped up I use this product to help clear everything out. It has helped me feel a whole lot healthier. The only thing I would say with both of these products is that you will definitely see better results if you drink 8-10 glasses of water while you are using them."
2,Great Results,This book arrived a lot sooner than I thought and in better condition than I anticipated.
1,Too hard to watch!,Couldn't watch more than 2 mins of this. It's so dated. The studio decor and dress were just too off-putting. Will have to keep looking for that 'perfect' ballroom dancing dvd to help us move to the next level beyond beginner.
1,English Please!,"I was quite disappointed when I opened this book and found the contents of the pages to be utter gibberish to me. This text is NOT in English. However, this is VERY misleading because when you preview the first few pages of the book it IS in the English version...so I bought this book thinking that it would be something completely different than it is. Good thing it was only 7 dollars. Complete waste of money and very misleading and dishonest."
2,Gungrave...not quite what you might expect,"Those thinking this is another version of Trigun will be disappointed. Gungrave is actually a lot deeper and more complex. The lead is short on dialouge, but the story has more depth and character development than most anime. The first DVD is more about the main character's past than about the reanimated killing machine he's become, but it definitely leaves you wanting more."
2,joycemarie58,Very pleased. Didn't think I would find it anywhere. In my opinion this is a classic. Happy I found it this.
1,The organization was very diificult to follow and confusing,"I wouldn't recommend this program, especially to a beginner. I've had 4 years of spanish a couple years ago and I wanted to improve my vocabulary and grammar and found it very difficult to do with this program. I also felt that someone coming in with no knowledge of spanish would be very frustrated and confused by this program. It gives menu choices of different things you can learn, grammar, vocabulary etc, but it doesn't tell you where it's best to start from. Also, if someone doesn't understand terms like ""Subjunctive"" and ""Indicitive Gerrund"" this would be even harder to understand. I'd definately recommend not to buy this program. I returned mine and now I am looking for a new program to try. good luck!"
1,Blind Justice,I was dissapointed with this movie. The accents are inaccurate and the story line is not as good as the book on which it has been based.
2,"Meliara is a Hard-to-get female for her ""suitors""","Though not as action-packed as it's previous book, Court Duel needs to be read in order for readers to understand a hidden subplot in Crown Duel. In Crown Duel, it was a fight to keep Meliara's land and position. In Court Duel, a different fight approaches that Meliara is an idiot at, which she learns slowly from her giddy & pleasant to-be sister-in-law. Court fights evolve around linage and suitors, which now catches Meliara's interest. She eventually evolves around to sending letters to a secret admirer, who may not be as secret as he seems. This was a nice, yet expected, ending for Meliara. Very Happy, traditional Fairy Tale ending. Just that this female really played ""Hard-to-Get""."
1,How Do I Know When I Never Received It ???!!!,"Have'nt a clue how good or bad the game is. Amazon tried twice to ship it to me ,but I never received it! it was a Christmas present for my brother,needless to say he never received it!I just bought this game for him on Ebay (new) and I received it in three days!What's the deal, Amazon ?"
1,cant even belive it,wrong size and has a holeim not even trying to waste my money sending this back i dont reccomend a site that gives you the wrong size zero stars
1,defective DVD,"Great movie, but the brand new DVD ( Gettysburg) froze several times. The movie was played on a new sony DVD player that had no problems with any other movies new or used. have yet to return it, but Amazon has lost my business"
2,Essential reference for serious herpetologists,"Petranka provides a masterful summary of our current state of knowledge about the taxonomy, natural history, ecology, and behavior of North American salamanders. No other work comes close to matching the depth of coverage of this book. It is no surprise that this work received the Wildlife Society's prestigious Book of the Year Award."
2,Hilarious!,"Every time this movie comes on my husband (who is English) and I watch it and laugh our heads off.If you have ever been in an English train station,drinking weak,watery cups of tea out of dirty,cracked cups.Smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there.And not to be crule,but these are not exactly a couple of sex-pots.The thought of two stodgy old English people being driven wild by their passion for each other is,well------------------ hilarious! I give it 5 stars for being so darn funny.Oh--- and the music---- PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! But it is worth watching for a good laugh!"
1,Product Cracked after 2 hours use,"Purchased this thing, arrived next day. Love Amazon Prime :)Installed it, tasted great. An hour later went to use it and the plastic had cracked.Ordered a replacement with Amazon, will update my review when new unit arrives."
2,Way to Go Amazon! Very cool,"Just got done watching the show and it was awesome. Of course I had to download the tool, how else do you get started? Once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when I was ready. Note to self get cable, DSL is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome. No commercials!I didn't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it."
1,My poor pores.,"Haven't seen a difference in pore size. I wasn't expecting to. I decided to purchase this product because the toner I usually buy wasn't available. Although it didn't work regarding my pores, it does give your face an extra clean."
2,Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p,I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.
2,Kipper of the Flame,"In terms of tone and cultural significance it is the aural equivalent of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I listened to it in front of the Antiques Roadshow with the sound off, a bag of lemon bon bons and a shonky spiff and here's something I don't mind telling you music lover ... it were a proper treat ... ""When Big Joan comes out her arms are too small, her head like a ball, she tied off her horse and galloped off into the moonbeams, she pulled up her blouse and compared her navel to the moon ..."" I don't know who she is but my geography teacher was called Joan so I like to think it's about her."
1,"Vince...Ben, how could you??","No prude here but there's a limit to the amount of crude ""humor"" I can endure and this POS pegged the needle. A couple of laughs early on regarding Vince Vaughn's stereotypical character he plays...dumb/insensitive/clueless...I could go on. But once the F-word started dropping like carpet bombs I'd pretty much had it. These four actors must have been coerced by the almighty $ to show up in this beyond pathetic waste of celluloid. One star is overly generous."
1,Too much emphasis on training,"I was looking for a good read on the exploits and battles of commando units - and this book was a disappointment. Out of 430 pages, 260 deal with training - and the remaining pages deal with listening posts setup during desert-storm. Those items will probably hold interest for many readers, but if you're looking for a firefight - this is not the book for you."
1,Oh please.......,"I read ""Edge of Evil"" and thought it pretty dreadful, but thought maybe the next one would be better. Boy, was I wrong. This one is just as bad. Ali Reynolds is your stock beautiful, successful woman doing really stupid things Why did she marry this jerk in the first place? Then by coincidence she drives by the railroad tracks just as he is killed? Oh please..... Then, she has money for everything, no matter how outrageous, and expects complete loyality from everyone. I gave it one star for the one moment in the book where she realizes she may have had something to do with the demise of the marriage. She remembers that her dead husband mentioned he wanted children and she said no way to that. How wonderful for her to recognize that it was not all his fault. It takes two. All in all I found the book tedious and the main character tiresome and the whole situation unbelievable. The early JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady booksw are much better."
1,Poor Service from Home and Beyond,"I still have not receivied what I ordered and paid for. They claim the first shippemnt was damaged and have yet to ship a replacement. Three phone calls were not returned from them. The vendor is very slow to resolve the problem. They said it would be here last week, now it is this week. I have no confidence that they will ever deliver the product."
1,slinky crystal radio,Winding the tuning coil was critical and ridiculously hard to do. Assembly of the cheap parts (toilet paper roll) and single plastic folding form was tough to get to stay fixed once assembled. Never got the radio to work although it did pick up some static.
2,great book,"Held my interest throughout...will look for more Bartlett mysterious., especially Resnick..anyone who likes mysteries will like this one . Try it!@"
1,Old Orchard Beach... love the place,"I was thrilled when this movie began as the car approached the center of Old Orchard Beach in the rain. Oh how it brought back memories of going there in EXCITEMENT as a youth some 50 years ago. Anyone else remember the Noah's Ark fun house? Or beneath it, the donkey ride that led you through the 7 Dwarves Diamond Mine? Returned there two summers ago and found the beach as PRISTINE WHITE as I recalled it. The CRYSTAL CLEAR water of the Atlantic ocean was the same as well. Thank you Jesus, Old Orchard clam cakes were still a DELIGHTFUL experience for one's taste buds.Oh.... this film. It was fully DULL, DREARILY DARK, DANKLY DIRTY and DISTASTEFUL. The only message one could get from this disaster is: Do not let these people anywhere near your gophers (or gerbils, or wife, or children, or wallet, or voting booth, or local unemployment office.....)"
1,Adhesive sucks,"The clip is an excellent system and idea. I don't know what idiot at Rivet thought to attach the clip to phones with adhesive. After having my phone drop several times due to the adhesive giving out, and one time breaking a $400+ dollar iphone - I was PISSED OFF. I still have my rivet clip, and I would very much like to use it, but these idiots don't want to make a case with the ""pin"" part built into the case, so the clip is useless. It's almost laughable to have such a sturdy metal clip attach to your phone with adhesive. It seriously makes me sick. Anyone know a WELDER? The only way I'd EVER use this clip is if the pin were WELDED to a metal case. (or better yet, simply manufactured to be a PART of it!)"
1,Ironic,"How Ironic that this author write a book about Reagan and slams Obama in 3 trashy books, Now you tell me are those books tells a true tale or this author has found a market to sell hate and lies."
2,the Grimm One's getting too amercanized,"An altogether decent album, but too much influenced by Mr Coxon's passing fads (ie skateboarding). ""Oochy woochy"" and ""That's when I reach for my revolver"" make excellent singles. If you can get the CD on sale it's worth it. As a side note, the merchandise at transcopic.com (and the site in general) needs work."
2,Good Early Springsteen,Bought this at Half Price Books (Sony/BMS Japan 2005) for $7. Good early Springsteen (and band). Sound quality is very good. Some claim the Japanese pressings (and mixes) are often better than US versions but I don't have anything to compare on this specific one.
2,Did not receive this product,"The rating is based on my purchase of the product elsewhere but my comments are related to my experience buying from this vendor. I was sent another brand that was very different from the intended product. I called customer service and they apologized and offered me 50% refund to keep the prodcut. Hmmm, sounds like ""bait and switch"". I found their product at other locations for 50% less than their 50% discount on the original prodcut. I returned the product and received full refund. Overall, the exprience was acceptable but I don't have what I ordered."
2,I love this book,"I love this book and refer to it often. I have not only referred to it for insight and interpretations of my own dreams, but also that of my children, family and friends. I keep it handy in my night stand. The only thing that would make it better is a lengthier key word dictionary, as there have been occasions where I could not find a word I was looking for."
2,Seth Green at his Best,"Robot Chicken is the creation of Seth Green, the little guy that played the son of Dr Evil on the Austin Powers Movies and also provides the voice of Chris on the Family Guy cartoons. Part of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim these short sketches are nothing short of comedic genius. From G.I. Joe parodies which is my favorite one, to Calvin and Hobbes they dabble in a little bit of everything from past and present pop culture. If you have not been tuning in to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and you are a fan of Family Guy Cartoons and Sick and Funny Animated Shorts, then buy this DVD and you will not regret it."
2,TEST EQUIPMENT,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOOL. WORKS GREAT AND GIVES YOU A HEADS UP ON ANY PROBLEMS BEFORE YOU TAKE IT TO A GARAGE. SOME THINGS YOU CAN DO YOURSELF IF YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM. CODES ARE EASY TO FIND ONLINE. DELIVERY WAS PROMPT AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS USING IT. INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASIC AND TO THE POINT, BUT SUFFICIENT."
2,The ultimate agent 86,"I used to watch the series on tv, when I was younger...and I still think that's the best Agent 86 ever!"
2,100 Hikes in Oregon's Central Cascades,"Since I have spent the better part of my life hiking in the Central Cascades of Oregon, I thought I would buy the book to expand my knowledge of the area and to also review some of my many treks. The book is well organized and provides many details for each hike that includes accurate directions to each destination. Well worth the investment."
2,I am sooo sore!!!!,"After 2 days of doing this work out, I am sooo sore!!!I am not familiar with some of the moves in this workout but I am learning. It is hard to follow along as you are learning new movements. I wish there was a part that you could play, just for beginners that explained some of the movements and slowed them down for you. I also wish there was more cardio involved because I feel like I need a separate cardio workout. That said, I am feeling it and I do sweat. I did both sections the first time but don't have time to do that everyday. I do recommend this workout though, especially if you are looking to vary your usual routine."
1,Scratches Knives,"This machine made my blades sharp. However, it scratched my brand new knives on the side. Circular scratches. I don't recommend. I was very careful when pulling the knives through the appropriate stage. This is being returned."
1,Very poor sound :((( Dissapointed big time,"I expected more from it... Sound is terrible and so plastic! not possible to enjoy music with this speakers. No sound/effects/volume adjustments helped, it is still making dzzzzzzz sounds even on low volume"
2,Copy-cat,"Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new."
1,"Skim it, at best","I've had it with Jordan. This is the last book of the Wheel of Time I will ever buy. I regret buying this one. Professional reviewers call for patience, ask us to wait because the NEXT book will be interesting. Give me a break! Jordan is spooning out endlessly tiresome minutae and characters that have little to do with the promised Last Battle. Besides, if the conclusion of this series ever happens, who is going to possibly remember a character in book seven, relating to one in ten, and back to something we all read years and years ago? If Jordan was a new author, this book would never be published."
2,Me and Jerry/Me and Chet - Fingerpicking at its best,"I purchased both of these ablums - Me and Jerry & Me and Chet - when they were first released on vinyl when I was in high school back in the 70's. They quickly became two of my favorite Chet albums; and, I rarely listened to anything but Chet. My 13-year-old son, who is a gifted Chet Atkins style guitarist, recently asked my why I hadn't purchased one of Chet and Jerry Reed's alumbs on CD. My reason was because I could never find them. It took an Austrlian company to finally release these albums on CD. Thank you Raven Records!! These recordings rank at the very top of Chet's recordings. They are fingerpicking at its best."
1,Vista 64 users BEWARE!!!!,"I will not start out by mentioning the DRM, as it has been addressed over 1,000 times on Amazon. I am running Vista 64 and have had numerous crashes on the Space stage. I would also like to mention that this is the only game currently installed on my system, and that I have done a clean install 1 week ago.When the game works, it is enjoyable... but beware, as I have experienced numerous lockups and crashes in the space stage.Also, I would like to note that if you are running this on Vista, you will have to run this game under your administrator account and in XP Service Pack 2 mode for it to run properly on 64. This took me a couple of hours to figure out when I first installed the game... Found it on a message board (which was not EA's).Between the crashes and the DRM, a game that would be otherwise pretty good, has become a regrettably purchase. I WANT MY MONEY BACK EA!!!!!!"
2,Read at your own risk!,"Two types of people should read this book. The first type of person is the liberal. For too long liberals have been hiding, for fear that others would find out their dirty little secret. It's time to come out of the closet. Al Franken has made it so.The second type of person who should read this book is the intellectually curious. I am astounded by the number of inaccuracies that Al Franken has pointed out. It is amazingly detailed in its research. The conservative media are often lazy in its fact checking. Sometimes they flat out lie!Caution! Do not read this if you are conservative. It actually proves that many of the ""facts"" you have come to know and love are actually falsehoods! You guys, just keep writing your negative reviews of this book and we'll all be happy."
1,Awful! Just awful! Can I give it zero stars?!?!?!!?,"Cringe-worthy acting and a vapid script. Over-the-top racialized stereotypes and unrealistic dialogue. (Sidenote: When is the last time you heard a black guy/girl say that they couldn't date another girl/guy because s/he is ""Chaldean?"" And then proceeding to break down the cultural differences between the Chaldeans and Lebanese. HUH?!?!?! Where they do that at? This movie is trying too hard and failing! ::eye roll::You will be sorely disappointed if you waste even a minute of your time on this sorry excuse of a movie. Don't be tempted one second by this so-called forbidden fruit..."
1,Kaplan CSET,"I took the CSET exam July 10, 2010 This book was not helpful other than for music section. I was upset at the amount of paid for the book,"
2,I liked this story.,I liked this story. It was worth the money I spent. It is a good scence fiction movie and I am placing it in my collection of DVD's.
2,This was the first Jeffery book I read - powerful!,"Jeffery is one of the most important figures on Christian prophecy. He has written one of the major fictional accounts of the Lords second coming and the End of Days but book is NOT fiction - this is real! This is a great book as well as a great work of Christian prophecy, the New World Order and the Antichrist. Jeffrey knows his stuff; he has written and spoken about the Messiah, the Apocalypse and Armageddon. If you have any doubts, he will remove them. Read before it's too late!For a very compelling docudrama DVD Movie on the End of Days see:The Final Events DVDThe movie is great because it shows CNN like news reports of what will happen during the End Days.Both are well recommended. The movie is also good to show unbelievers as it is very powerfully convincing."
2,These books Rock!,"Growing up in a military family makes me like the style of these books all the more. They pull you into the Halo universe and you immediately become attached to the characters. Great stories and insight into the award winning game, Halo. After reading it I wanted to play some Halo and kick some Covenant rear!"
1,Do not waste your money!,This toy is a piece of junk! It didnt even last a day without the hoses coming off. Very dissatisfied
1,"If you have Rudy's other DVDs, don't bother with this one!",This DVD is a repackaged/remixed version of his other two France travel DVDs. I was disappointed to see the exact episodes that we already have under different titles.
1,"Cuisinart ""Drips-A-Lot"" Coffee Maker","I purchased this item as a gift for a friend with red accents in her Miami kitchen. It makes good coffee, but there is no way to pour a cup without several drops of coffee sliding from the spout down the side of the carafe and dripping off the bottom onto your counter, floor, or other surface. This happens irregardless of how full or empty the carafe is, or how fast or slow one pours. One is constantly cleaning the counter or floor of coffee drips! Not recommended for this reason."
1,Sadness comes to my house,Book was not like new. It looked like it had been used to beat a mule to death. I tossed it in the garbage when I opened the package. I will just replace it with a new copy from Barnes & Noble. Sadness comes in many forms and for me today it came in the form this book.
1,leaks in rain,"this was perfect size for my yard, and had opening on the narrow side. but leaked terribly in heavy rain and ruined the stuff inside"
1,NOT a rear support bracket,Bought these because I was told they would serve as rear support brackets for a power amp. They DO NOT. Buy exactly what your amp/effect manufacturer recommends.
2,DT830B ..... Useful & Cheap,The DT830B VOM is a dirt cheap useful tool.10A Max and yellow so you can find it.Comes with a battery too.
2,DSM-IV,This was a smooth transaction. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected in brand new conditon. I would definitely transact business with this seller again.
2,The Sheltering Sky,"For those of us fortunate enough to have been in North Africa, visited Paul Bowles' Morocco, and walked in the footsteps of Port and Kit Moresby through the intricacy of forgotten souks while followed by mules, and multiracial children speaking French, Spanish, Arabic and some English, this movie will refresh and invigorate the passion for travel. It will illuminate the travails of relationships, cultures, the unfathomable grief of losses; the whirlwind of ignited desire. Strongly recommend."
2,A book of lists!,"This review book of neonatology covers the subject well, primarly with a series of lists that are organized in accordance with the various body systems. These lists cover rather extensively the various number of conditions/diseases but ocassionally in a rather brief fashion. I did find the endless pages of lists to get rather ""hypnotizing"" but the information is excellent and everything one needs for an thorough review of neonatology is found in this book. A brillant bonus is in the last few pages which distills vital formulas that one is sure to need for board exams."
2,Mystery Walk rocks!,"This is a marvelous book. I was hooked within the first few pages of the book. I couldn't put it down until I reached the end. It's a wild roller-coaster ride of emotions. I found it to be one of those books that when I finished reading it, I still wanted to read more about the characters and continue the adventure of the Mystery Walk. Robert McCammon's writing and storytelling are amazing. You can read his work and never have to realize that you are reading. You can just totally lose yourself in the fiction. I also very much enjoyed Robert McCammon's Swan Song and Boy's Life and I will surely be reading more of his work."
2,An Orthodox primer,"A very good quick reference for the Services of the Holy Orthodox Church, but also very interesting from a historical point, because of St Symeon's description of the Cathedral services of Thessaloniki at his time. I find the translation a little stilted, but it does not affect the value of this book. There is so much Theology in our Services, not only in the Divine Liturgy, but all of them, and it is a very useful book for newcomers to the Faith, as the other reviewer mentioned. Now I just wish that all of St Symeon's writings would be translated into English!"
1,This movie was so boring,"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I actually walked out and left during the intermission. There is no plot, or if there is, it is very thinly constructed. It is basically scenes of the Civil War battles. There are no main characters that the movie focuses on. For example, in BAND OF BROTHERS, the movie is about World War II, but there were main characters that the film is about. This one had no main characters I could see. It was a poorly made movie."
1,weak and boring album,"I don't know what the other hyperventilating reviewers are smokin, but this album is really weak and boring. Don't waste your time or money. This is the weakest album they've ever made. Just stick to the recordings from 1979-1989, and forget about the mostly rubbish that has come since."
2,I loved it,"I hadn't realized that this was book 2, but I read it and loved it anyway, without the benefit of reading Book 1 first. I can't believe it worked, with such an established alternate world and complex characters. Ms. Briggs has a beautiful way of weaving intriguing plotlines amongst character development that looks seamless. If there was a lot of backstory, it wasn't noticeable to me. I recommend it as a fascinating read."
1,another exercise in pseudo-spirituality,"This book will give some people the psychological comfort they're seeking but for me it was just another exercise in pseudo-spirituality. I have read countless books on spirituality and self-improvement, and I can honestly say this book is no exception. Personally, the more I question my existence the less I believe in a human ""soul"" - rather it's ALL soul (or whatever you want to call it - spirit, energy, intelligence, God, Easter Bunny!). Personally, I wouldn't bother with this book and check out Krishnamurti's, Book of Life or Total Freedom."
1,Destroyer of Wireless Lans,I am embarrased how my Panasonic Phone Totally destroys 802.11 Wireless Lans... My neighborhood is full of Wireless Lans and 2.4ghz phones causing friction and anger in neighborhood. I and some of my neighbors are THROWING AWAY the 2.4ghz phones for 900mhz phones that co-exist with Wireless Lans..Panasonic should warn on the lable of the box that the 2.4ghz phone will cause your Neighbors to HATE you.... Nothing but trouble not knowing that the 2.4ghz phone causes more grief than benefit... Wish I know this before I wasted my Money on the 2.4Giga Range phone. Had to disconnect it. Waste of my money and just makes all my neighbors Mad...
1,Smells terrible,I bought this for myself because I'm a poto phan girl and it smelled like it was a stale dollar store perfume ugh I'm only keeping It because it says phantom that's it. It smells terrible
1,Fair,For some reason the interior artwork was inferior to The clue of The Hissing Serpent - this volumes' successor. Shattered Helmut I found a fairly decent read. A lot of interaction with the criminals. I particulary liked the character Kitten Cole who was regretably caught early on page 136. The brothers travel to Greece (Don't care for that part). I compare all volumes with one another and like 90% of the higher volumes they are drastically inferior to the lower volumes. Call a spade a spade and do not give every book a 5 star rating. This book was ok - but worthy of nothing higher than a 2. RATED C
1,Not if you are serious about taking pictures........,"Okay. I admit to not expecting a great deal from this camera, but I was really hoping for the best. It's difficult to use the digital part, but the instant pictures were fun! I finally gave it to the kids to play with. They love to practice, but have yet to take a good digital picture. Much more of a toy than useful camera."
1,a small book of poetry in four sections,"This is a collection of poems published in 1917.The first section of poems are domestic (as the title suggests), such as; ""Bayberry Candles"" and ""The Cedar Chest"". The 2nd section is called ""A Handful of Sonnets"". Some of these poems are ""O. Henry - Apothecary"" and ""For the Centenary of Keat's Sonnet"". The 3rd section is entitled ""War"". Poems like ""On Vimy Ridge"" and ""To a U-Boat"". The 4th section's poems seem to be random. Anything from ""At a Dog Show"", to ""Ballad of New Amsterdam"" to ""Moons We Saw at Seventeen"". There are 72 poems in all.Some of the poems are short and simple. Others are more complex. The sad part is that the longer poems are not complete. Whoever scanned the pages of the original book left off the endings of the longer poems :(- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe"
1,Lack of character,"Although the book may be poetic and lyrically written, the superfluity of figurative language and abstract narration makes it difficult to extract the true meaning behind its short stories and anecdotes. The lack of definitive characters, names, and personalities make it difficult to tell exactly what is going on and completely renders character development obsolete. The book, although it addresses very real tensions on several factors, fails to drive home the significance of tribulations and common place yet serious issues that the migrant workers deal with because of it's occult language and stream of conscious stylistic writing. If you can read Spanish, the original is far more impactful than the translated version, but still leaves the reader in an unsatisfied state of confusion as to what actually happened. For those of you who do not care for stories without a story, this book is not for you."
1,Weak story and even weaker female lead.,This is the worst Palmer I have ever read. The male is a horrible guy who says things no woman should hear. The female lead has no backbone and repeats herself over and over. Do not waste the money.
1,Don't like him,I personally don't like Lil' Romeo or Master P. I don't think he's a good rapper and he should leave the music industry.
2,Took this on our honeymoon,"This book is fun to read and relatively easy to navigate. Everywhere we went, we saw people carrying the same book. I also purchased another Big Island book just to cross reference. It's confusing to tour around the Island. It's very large and the city names sound the same. This book is an essential tool."
1,Better title would be 101 ways to abuse your dog.,"The author takes a very disturbing look on the world and on dog training. Besides thinking that motorists take great delight on hitting dogs that are on a leash with their owner she uses a heavy handed approach in her training. Save your money and invest in a book that teaches how to train your dog through positive reinforcement and not abuse, your dog will thank you."
1,"Flashlight poorly made, otherwise good tool","I own several other Swiss-tech tools, and love them all. This is my only disappointment. I bought one of these for me and one for my dad based on how much I like their other stuff. My flashlight does not work well, can't get the circuit to stay completed because of flimsy plastic construction. My dad's won't work at all. I'd stay away from this one in favor of their other, all-metal offerings, which are excellent, especially the utli-key, which is brilliantly designed."
1,Inadequate description!,The product description does not say whether the mug is microwave/dishwasher safe. There is no information about how many pieces are included in the box. How is a buyer expected to make a purchase?
2,Liner Notes,"I thought several of the renditions on this album were terrific. (No surprise, but my favorite was Lotte Lenya on Pirate Jenny.) I do have a quibble, though. Why no list of who is singing what?"
2,Definately Worth Every Penny!,"We aren't even all the way through this but I just had to tell others that this is definately worth the small price it costs! My 5 yr. old just struggled with every other program we used, this one is just so much more natural~ She is just flowing right through it and really understanding reading! It is clear and simple to learn and teach with this book. I am just amazed how basic this book has made things...Thank You for writing it!Homeschooling mom to 5 children for 4 years!"
1,I simply cannot believe,that I finished this book. It took me weeks because I had to take a couple days off every few dozen pages simply to remind myself that the real world still exists.Why did I finish it then? Primarily because I could not believe that it would end on the planet Earth.
1,Only Lasted 15 minutes,I had to return this charger only after 15 minutes of use. Not sure what went wrong with the charger. But after using it for 15 minutes it shut off and never turned on again. I don't know if it suffers in the heat of Los Angeles. The replacement they sent me went out in the same amount of time. I tried the two chargers on two different batteries and two different outlets. I wanted to make sure it wasn't the battery or the outlets causing the outage. It did not matter. It felt like both chargers overheated and burned out only after 15 minutes of use.
1,"just bits and pieces, not full version",the whole opening and closing was not on it. Just a few minutes of both of them. the same with the events.not all of it. It's a waste of money. I have never been so disappointed. What was the point in using blu ray. there wasn't that much.
1,LEAKS! BUT THE RAMP IS NICE.,"Leaky, leaky tub. The only way my husband and I could use it is by placing this tub in our own tub which is very uncomfortable as we have to bend down during the whole bath time. Put it on the counter and it will leak all over your bathroom floor.But now that our baby is older(since he was about 10 months old), he loves to play while sitting in it with the ramp in place. It is also easier to wash him now that he does not slip and slide all over the place. Without the ramp, this bath tub is worthless."
1,"Terrible customer service, unreliable product.","I liked this kettle while it worked, but it didn't work long enough. It began leaking at the bottom at just over a year, and Krups' customer service was dreadful. They don't stand by their products, and I won't make the mistake of buying one again. Though I don't believe they need to warranty an item such as this one indefinitely, for the price it should last more than a year. To make matters worse, Krups diverts warranty and repair issues to a third-party repair company, thereby limiting Krups' own dedication to customer support.Two stars because it was good while it lasted.Goodbye, Krups."
2,Derek Sherinian! The Future of Fusion Music!,"What's the deal with all the whining about this record? Why complain about this kind of music? Anybody that has been lucky enough to discover Derek's music should be thankful. Think of what a sorry shape mainstream music is in these days then think of the greatest keyboard player on the planet who hires the best guitar players to be had to play on his records then ask yourself WHAT AM I COMPLAINING ABOUT? Man this guy rocks! Every cd he has recorded is a must for people that want to have their brainwaves stimulated. I Highly recommend Blood Of The Snake. I have to ask myself have any of these negative reviewers ever heard Black Sabbath, Jeff Beck, or Dream Theatre? Will the real Heavy Music lovers please stand up? I have!"
1,This doesn't even deserve a star,"MUZAK! Just get Johnny Hartman+John Coltrane, but for Gosh sakes don't get this middle of the road pop album of muzak."
1,Contrived.,"""Scavenger"" contains 1-dimensional characters who fail to touch any chord of recognition. The prose is often forced, the descriptions unappealing. The ending is so contrived that I was actually angry at myself for finishing the book."
1,MS Mobile is the Problem,"Bought this as an upgrade from the 650. It is actually a downgrade though, the software from Microsoft is horrible compared to the Palm, so the 700 with Palm might be better. When on the phone the software will 'go places', i.e. it will open up programs, when the messages or phone rings it will open the volume control, and will not close it."
1,shoes,The picture of the shoes was deceiving. Did not want ankle strap. You could notgo by the picture. Which is how you do online shopping. Returned the shoes.
1,Clunky,"I returned this to Amazon, exchanging it for another set of earphones. I had not realized that it is designed as it is, with that little box attached. What does one do with the little box? This is a bad design."
1,Agree with first review!!!,"I own & love Frederic Delavier's ""Strength Training Anatomy"", so when I saw this one at a local bookstore, I anxiously leafed through it, hoping it would be of a similar caliber. I was very disappointed to see that apparently, women do not have shoulder, chest & arm muscles (see table of contents)! Guess they are marketing this book to women who are trying to spot-reduce thighs, butt, & abs. I don't buy into that myth and thus did not buy the book. BOO, HISS!!!"
2,DO NOT LISTEN TO THE HATERS,"People who are in love with this movie are in love with their purchase.People who are trying to find trivial things to complain about are the ones who are dying for special features.20 bucks for both a bluray and dvd, seriously? buy this now."
1,Vhs,"Garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage, garbage this movie was not good at all I hated don't know why I put one star"
2,"Better than I hoped, but not perfect","Love the watch, love the look but I had hoped it would be a little more durable. I bought it because of what I read about titanium not looking scratched very easily, but the band looks just as scratched as all my other watches - maybe even faster. However on the bright side, the face has been much more scratch resistant.All in all a nicely designed watch, wears nicely, looks nice, accurate. No real complaints just not as durable as I had been lead to believe it would be from various reviews I read."
2,from shy to charismatic,Wonderful read. this book really details how to converse and mingle. I am a self proclaimed shy guy and this has done wonders. keep it Mrs. lowndes
1,A slightly below average tale,"I will try not to give out spoilers.The characterization of Acornia's Quest improves from the first installment of this series, yet the language and dialogue feels forced. Interactions between characters don't seem to flow normally but lurch from line to line. Spontaneous reactions to certain events feel predetermined and faked. I can feel the weight of the author throughout the story thus, preventing me from truly falling into the spell of the words. This weight can be felt in the odd dialogue turns, the odd reasoning, and in certain resolution scenes at the end of the book."
2,Move over Dyson...,"the Eureka 431BXZ Optima lightweight Upright Vacuum although small in size is a powerful little wonder.. With the bagless filter that really filters the dirt and dust particle and the storage area for vacuumed item, this little puppy works beyond my expectations. So it doesn't have a ball, and you have to move it a little to get to the corners, heck when you save $200 what is a little moving around. It works and that is the bottom line..."
1,This was the worst christmas present ever,"We got it after my son was in the hospital, he wanted a wagon for christmas. I pulled it out of the box christmas eve to put it together so it would be under the tree christmas morning and pieces didn't even FIT! I put together what did fit and within a week (of not using it cause it was missing parts) the decals fell off the handle fell off. They shipped me another one for free but I haven't even bothered opening it yet for fear of what I will find. It was awful to try to put together and I am not looking forward to doing it again!"
1,"It was ok, but kinda predictable","Despite the stellar reviews that this book got from other readers, I was not impressed by Tombs of Atuan. To me, the storyline was just connect-the-dots, run-of-the-mill fantasy. Nothing new, nothing interesting. The dialouge was kinda ho-hum, too. The only plus side that I saw to this book was the characters and I thought the ending was somewhat interesting. I did not read the other books in this series so it is possible that my reveiw would have been a little more positive if I had done so. But overall, A big Ho-Hum."
1,Product Does Not Work!!!!! Dont Throw Your Money Away!!,"I thought if I bought a cheaper product it would still work just as good. WRONG! This product did not work at ALL. And when I tried to contact the company for technical support, I never got a respone after many tries. I recomend just spending the $30 and getting the name brand product for this type of software. I may as well have just burned the money in my fireplace."
1,"Good attempt, but little structure","This text on Western Civ. has a good deal of information, but at times it is hard to follow. The author has a tendancy to go off on tangents on the stupidest facts. However, I would recommend the book as a supplement to a more reliable primary textbook."
1,Predictable soap opera with poor dialogue,"The worst thing was the audio. In low registers voices were difficult to understand and somewhat 'gutteral"" in tone, especially Jeremy Irons. English subtitles are much needed to help the viewer understand the dialogue. Disappointed overall."
1,Boring,"I am a huge Stella Cameron fan, I have enjoyed her past works and look forward to her up in coming book Key West but More and More was a disapiontment. The love story was boring and the ending was perdictable."
1,product review,Sound quality is VERY POOR-as if you're in a tunnel. Only selection I liked wasA NEW DAY because the words were so inspiring!
1,This book is not informative.,"To endusers, they will find the concepts are too board and too general. If they expect this book can tell them how to use SAP and help them in their daily operations, they may be a bit disappointed.To SAP consultants, this book does not have adequate information. Actually, if they refer to the SAP On-line Documentation (SAP CD-ROM)or Document Print (SAP CD-ROM), they may find these materials are even more informative.The customer that this focus is quite blur."
2,What kind of person attacks the openness of a society?,"A fine work, tracing the foundational, philosophical assumptions upon which western overly-rational anti-social elitists depend,(both leftists and fascists)...in order to impose their dystopian fantasies. As relevant today as it has ever been. An essential text for anyone with a sincere love of personal freedom, and who want to be able to better sniff out the always-encroaching creepy ideological roots of tyranny."
1,Not the Wusthof I expected...,"My brother has always wanted a set of Wusthofs. I purchased these thinking they'd be heavy, wonderful knives. What I got were cafeteria-looking stainless knives that were very light and not attractive. The edges didn't look sharp, taking on the appearance of a butter knife. They will never even make it into my brother's hands. We didn't give them a chance when it came to performance but I need something that looks nicer and feels heavier to the grip. I didn't think these would fill his expectations for Wusthof knives."
1,Just put the check book down...,"Think, Think before you purchase this. There are so many other good products coming out in the near future, you don't need to taint your hard drive with this. You all think you got it bad because of the 'stutters' boo-hoo. This game messed up Windows so bad I couldnt access it for 3 hours, and I had to reformat my C: Disk. Beware, if you do buy this game, when it says ""Restart to finish installation"" it really means ""Bill Gates wants to give you a special gift for considering Linux"" Anyways... I finally installed it, it's choppy, and it's the only thing I have on my hard disk right now...I think Microsoft owes me big, actually no, we've all been cheated, let's start a letter writing campaign to our congressman about this game..because that's how much it bites!"
1,Broken and missing parts,"I don't know if this is the standard for this tripod, or just the seller I purchased from on Amazon! The camera attachment plate is missing, so there is NO way to attach the camera to the tripod - which kind of defeats the whole purpose. It is flimsy, and one of the clips did not secure the leg. Another plastic clip broke the second time I opened it!"
2,works great!,"I was skeptical at first because i didn't see any reviews concerning obstructions such as walls and doors.I bought two, one indoor and one outdoor. Indoor one works with my living room lamp. i use the outdoor outlet upstairs to control my internet equipment. From down stairs, I am able to turn on/off outlet just fine, even with door closed and through wall. So, i am assuming that the indoor will do the same.NOTE: sometimes the remote came with the cover screw twisted too tight, causing the remote not to work. just loosen the screw a little and it will work just fine. I want to say that because someone complains about remote didn't work."
2,I love this thing?,"I bought this small slow cooker as my original is still working but it is large. This thing is fantastic. Just the right size for a busy single guy. The best feature is the ""keep warm"" setting, which my older and larger slow cooker does not have. Once I cook a meal I leave the leftovers in the ceramic crock and place it in the refrigerator. The next day I place it back in the cooker and turn the knob to ""keep warm"" as I go out the door in the morning. When I come home in the evening, the food is just the right temperature and most importantly the food is not over cooked. My older slow cooker just had a ""low"" and ""high"" setting, often resulting in overcooked food over a period of 2-3 days. For a single person, this is a great slow cooker."
2,Very please customer,I am most pleased with my choice of ordering the bag. There is ample storage space and is designed with pockets and slots to hold anything you could think to take along with you. And it is sturdy and padded well to protect and store my laptop. Glad I decided on this type and brand.
2,Good sound,This product works great with my new computer. I would like to have a little more length in the cord coming from the computer.
2,Review: HP 10bII Financial Calculator,This product works great and is just what I needed for my college finance class. Helped me get that A- in FIN 320!!!Great product. Even greater product if you can get it cheap!
2,Pure Enjoyment,"This is an incredible, enjoyable DVD. I have it in my own library and have purchased it for a friend as a Christmas present. What a way to spend a few hours of complete enjoyment.KathleenW - Omaha, NE"
2,"A high-quality drive, working well on Macintosh OS X systems","I bought a 250Gb version, found it worked well, is fast, and is a very well made case. Then got two of the 500Gb Extremes. My only complaint is the power button: That round, blue light is too easy to touch mistakenly, is a soft-touch switch, and can damage the drive if hit inadvertently. I believe lawyers call this an 'attractive nuisance' and it was for me. So, DON'T TOUCH THE BLUE LIGHT! Otherwise, their service was quick. Described the problem on the phone, got an email RMA, and received a post-paid replacement within a week or so. Clearly, it might not be suited for Windows machines, but who'd buy one of those anyway??? ';-)"
1,"Misleading maps reflect historical bias, or at least inaccuracy","The maps of east Asia, specifically the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing empires, show a single color which seems to indicate that the Korean peninsula was usually part of China. In fact this was never true. What, did you hire a Chinese revisionist mapmaker and then not proofread for accuracy? A historical atlas needs to be accurate, because people look at it to see and learn. In fact you have ignored several kingdoms, including Goguryeo, Silla, Baekjae, Balhae, and several other smaller ones. These kingdoms existed for several hundred years. As a Korean descendent, I'm not only disappointed, but angry at this sort of negligence. My complaint is also directly corroborated by Rieu, readers, please see his review of this book on the web. If this part is so misleading, then I shudder to think what else is wrong in this atlas. Stay away from it; caveat emptor."
1,Very disappointing,"I just received my order and as soon as I finish writing this review I'll be listing it to sell on ebay or amazon. It's not worth the trouble or expense to return it so I'm glad I at least got free shipping for it from amazon. The pillow is indeed extremely soft and comfortable to touch, however it offers absolutely no supprt. I'm a very average sized person, I don't have an abnormally slender neck, but the pillow just flops around. It's also much too thin to offer any support. If this one is 4"" thick than I need one that's about 7"" thick to offer me any support. I do not recommend it."
1,Beware cheaper sellers,"We bought this item from one of the other vendors listed on Amazon under ""more buying choices"" -- PhoneSystemsAndChips, because it looked chepaer. We bought 4 of the cables. NONE of them worked. They would not stay plugged in -- the snap connection did not work on any of them.Note, I can't really get a refund because they structured the price so the item is really cheap, but the shipping was expensive. It looked cheaper overall, but once the product proved defective, the only thing you can get back is the really cheap item price, which was the smaller part of the purchase price."
2,Wonderfully told story of coming of age,"Lesley does a great job describing the awareness of Culver as he meets challenges growing up without a father. Culver's mother is a strong influence on the boy, but the real character he tries to emulate is his uncle who is a real outdoor's man. I have enjoyed all of Lesley's books and this one was also very good."
1,Don't believe the hype!,"I've been hearing a lot about ""milk"" lately. Its supposed to ""do a body good"" and improve your quality of life. My friends have been telling me for years that its essential to a balanced meal. I was just told last week that ""everyone was doing it"" and if I wanted to be cool I should too.Well, after 30 years I've just had my first glass of milk and I've got to say that I'm not impressed. Sure, it goes great with cereal, but I still couldn't run all that fast. I can't lift up cars or move giant pieces of concrete to save small animals. I still can't fly, turn invisible, or change into spandex in a phone booth. The only thing I was really impressed with was the way milk bubbles out my nose when I laugh. Still, thats not enough to get me to drink 3 glasses of the stuff a day! All in all I'm more than a little disappointed. I'd suggest shopping around a bit before spending that $3.99."
1,I returned this headset,"I had to return this headset because of the constant complaints I received from my callers. They all complained of an echo (they could hear themselves talking). I thought this headset was good despite that. However, what's the point in having a headset if no one wants to talk to you. So I am trying the Jabra JBT350V to see if that's better. Someone who reviewed this item addressed the echoing. He said it wasn't much of a problem. We'll see."
1,You must be kidding!,"I love mysteries, but this one required too much suspension of disbelief. For example, agoraphobia is often treated successfully, but we are suppossed to swallow the idea that a woman with a trust fund opts to stay indoors instead of getting treatment. Please! I was hoping she would be the corpse in the first book to get rid of her! No more of this series for me."
1,Coffee Table book,"Looks good. The page layout has a 4x4 picture on one side and a brief description on the other side (1-4 sentences) about each building. The book can be very off on the adress; an example being Morphosis, Caltrans 7 HQ. In the book it's address is 312 North Spring Street, well on the side of the building is a 2 story size carving of the address that states: 100. It's actually at 1st and Main, which you can make out in the 4x4 picture in the book. Hard to get that wrong, but they did. Also, I was looking for purely architecture, not caring too much for interiors, but really wanted old LA and New. This book goes into some newly remodeled spaces and just new architecture from the last 8 years. So all in all it's cute book."
1,No product support,"I'm no stranger to computer applications (I've been installing and using them since 1985), but I cannot get this product to display in a manner such that I can use it. The bottom margins are cut off, so all the necessary ""buttons"" are inaccessible.I emailed the support email address given but my email bounced."
2,b2k what a girl wants,"i think that b2k the song called what a girl wants is a cool song becuse it's respecting girls it has a nice beet and hes beeing polite when he speekes with his freands on how to treat a girl and this song makes sence and not raping aboute jonts and saying rude commites it shows repect i dont know where i can buy that album with that song on it but i will deflty buy that any time compare to dmx,missy e,jay z,ect"
2,"""Gives Me Hope""","Excellent, simply excellent. Love almost all the songs. So soulful especially, the ambient version of ""Home And Dry."" Then, the other versions of the same song explode like fireworks at Disneyland, just as colorful and just as spectacular. ""Closer To Heaven"" ""gives me hope,"" just as the song says. The Pet Shop Boys definitely gave ""All Their Love"" to not only this song but this entire CD. I would suggest a B U Y ""Right Now""(another excellent dance song)."
1,INCORRECT VERSION,I have tried twice to purchase the correct version of the DVD Flanders & Brussels. Both times I received the PAL version which does not work in the US or Canada. I did click on the correct item when I ordered but somehow kept getting the wrong one. The Returns dept. was very pleasant and helpful for me to return the useless DVDs.It does not deserve the one star I was forced to give it above
1,disappointed,"We were very disappointed in this station. The digits can't be seen unless you are just two feet from it. We have and wanted another station that can be seen 5-6 feet away. This station offers an alarm, snooze etc. too many buttons. You can't pick it up without pushing one of the 5 buttons around the face. I wish I would have sent it back."
2,Great Condition,They said it was just like new and they were correct. I have yet to be disapointed when buying an item through Amazon...and we love saving $$$ with them.
1,Not a good value for the money,"The book is very small and the pictures are so tiny with such thick lines,they are not what I thought they would be.NOT a good value for the money.I would not recommend them to anyone."
2,Perfect for my needs,"For some reason when I purchase these I thought they were zip lock bags. I was in a hurry to find clear plastic bags so I bought them without looking too closely. I actually just wanted a plain bag without a zipped top, so I was pleasantly surprised when I received them in the mail. They're the right thickness to ship many different items. Shipping was a little slow but they're high quality bags."
2,"A beautiful, simple and elegant book on polyhedra","A friend of mine lent me this book in 1975. (I still haven't given it back). Although this 200 page book is very simply and clearly written, I have never been able to sit down and read it from start to finish. Each part I read makes me stop and contemplate. After 24 years I still find new things in it! The book starts out describing the five Platonic solids. Next it explores the dualities: between the octahedron and cube, between the dodecahedron and icosohedron, and between the tetrahedron with itself. Holden talks about solids discovered by Kepler and Poinsot, space filling solids other than the cube, Nolids, lattices and a whole lot more. He also describes how to make your own models with cardboard and Elmers' glue. Doug Kendall's photographs of Holden's models are very pleasing. This is my favorite book."
1,Embellished,"Even though Boren is an experienced writer, and a good one at that, he embellishes his books to the point where they are no longer a reliable source of information. He has embellished the truth so much so, that this book is nothing short of a ficticious tale. Anyone who would use this book to aide them in a search for the Lost Rhoades Mine, or the fabled Shin-Ob is running after a ghost. Mr. Boren also invented the Shin-Ob, as well as the word ""Towats"" to mean ""The Great Sprit"". Towats means ""Man"" nothing else. This book is great for the fire place."
1,Don't confuse this with the High Gloss version,"Apparently, HP has stopped making the High Gloss version of the 4x6"" Premium Plus photo paper. I bought this once by mistake and found the colors to be really awful, as if I had used really cheap paper. Buy their ""Premium"" paper instead. It's almost as good as the ""Premium Plus"" used to be."
1,wanna be euro-metal at its lowest,"I can't believe it. This group takes credit for something that has been done countless times. Now just because euro-metal is not big in the states does not mean a band like Evanescence deserves to take credit for its style of play. Hey fans, listen to Lacuna Coil. Chances are great you have no clue who I'm referring to. Lacuna Coil's first album was made in 1998, long before Evanescence was even an idea. Lacuna Coil is more melodic, aggressive, and passionate than these poseurs. Whoever considers Evanescence goth most likely does not know what good music is or anything for that matter. Just look at what else fans who bought this album on Amazon also purchased: Staind, Sarah McGlachlan, Dido, Godsmack, oh and my favorite, Linkin Park. Give yourself pats on your backs, folks. You are only making these undeserving acts richer while they're stealing not only your money, but your ears too."
2,"Oh Sarah, how we all love you","First off, this is obviously a beautiful and strong cd. I think that has been well established. Sarah McLachlan is clearly a talented singer, pianist, songwriter, etc....Personally, I like this cd even better than 'Surfacing', which won Sarah greater acclaim. 'Fumbling towards Ecstasy' is quite ecclectic and suprisingly raw; the risks that she takes by exploring different sounds are well-rewarded, because it establishes her as an artist, not just as a singer."
2,Highly recommended!,"This book contains a wealth of well presented and organized information, which is not easy to find in texts of similar level. I especially enjoyed the style and clarity of presentation. Outstanding!"
1,junk,I had a 512 mg sansa player that worked wonderfully. but after 2 years of almost daily use playing audio books it wore out. This 240 is a poor excuse for a replacement. It does not have the book friendly features of the 512.
2,Great textbook,"It certainly helps one understand much better how to work with children and provide techniques. However, I think it is because I used this with my Child Therapy class in graduate school so I can utilize this book to its fullest potential. If you're just reading it, it might be hard to practice some of the techniques because it might be as obvious. It's not the best written piece but the author is definitely knowledgeable."
1,Not what I ordered.,"I ordered this product but instead received a bag with a smaller version of the same body wash, a lotion, one bar of soap and a sponge. I like the product but not the mistake in shipping the wrong package."
1,JUNK,Do not buy! I bought these twice and had them replaced twice. Never again. The Evans Dot drum head is much better.
2,This is THE BOOK on Bin Laden,"This is a magnificent gem of a book and is THE book as far as I'm concerned on Bin Laden. Dennis provides a masterful description and profile of Bin Laden (psychological aspects and motivations) and a very cogent explanation of how Bin Laden's political agenda and political thought fit with the intellectual currents found within the larger Muslim world. His presentation and analysis of President Khatami of Iran and Osama Bin Laden as essentially two competing spokesmen for the contemporary Muslim world illustrating the two divergent paths (reaction versus reform) that the Muslim world may take in the years ahead was both highly original and highly insightful. I thought there was more information packed into this book in 126 pages than I found as a reader (and owner) of books by people like Peter Bergen, Yossef Bodansky and others. A highly relevant expose. Makes a complex man and a complex subject very understandable."
1,Great concept but not made for sharp puppy teeth,"I was looking for a toy that would challenge and keep the attention of my puppy and this seemed like a great find. He loved the squeakers and the crinkle paper inside the bone and the rings but it didn't take long for his sharp little teeth to rip holes in the bone and in the rings. Also, the rings were so hard to remove from the bone that he never quite got the hang of pulling them off, at least not on purpose. Perhaps the Intellibone would be better for an older dog that isn't an aggressive chewer."
1,It doesnt work on my PS3,"This cable doesn't have te original connector to the PS3, its only 2 HDTV connectors, no PS3 and HDTV."
1,"One hit wonders, and deservedly so","I was completely blown away the first time I heard ""I Don't Mind"", and decades later I still love the song. I owned this album first time around, having run out to buy it as soon as I heard the single. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Nothing else on the album comes even remotely close to the beauty and pathos of that song. In fact, with the possible exceptions of ""Waiting for the Worm to Turn"" and ""Coma"" (the other track to feature the string quartet heard so prominently in ""I Don't Mind""), nothing else was even close to listenable for me.Your mileage may vary, of course, but I strongly encourage potential buyers to listen to the online samples rather than assuming that the album's other nine tracks will compare to its one big hit."
2,A great addition to my collection,"This book is one of my favorite Christmas presents! I've been interested in Chinese language for a number of years, and particularly in the written language and its history. I'm certain my Chinese friends have gotten tired of my questions: How did this evolve, when did this enter the language, why, etc. Now I own a book that will help me solve some of the puzzles. Very interesting, accurate, and fun to explore."
2,Great value and nutritional benefits.,"I love this hemp protein. I had struggled to digest the whey protein properly and found that hemp was a lot better on my system. The taste isn't too bad as I mix it with coconut milk. After comparing many different ingredient labels, I'm very pleased with the nutritional value as well."
1,Unit description is misleading,"Ok... well... I finally got my scan tool in the mail and I was all excited to use it. I mainly bought the unit to assist me in diagnosis and LIVE PARAMETER readings, which it did none of. I went through the horrible written manual and it mentions in there ""Field Service"", which is what Actron calls their LIVE PARAMETER readings. I start reading the instructions to use this feature and all was good. I plug it in, go through the instructions just to find out that the unit itself DOES NOT HAVE THE ""FIELD SERVICE"" option!!!!!!!!... so that means no live parameter reading at all, which greatly disappoints me. I will be sending this unit back."
1,For true beginners only,"This book covers only the very basics, some open chords and strumming patterns. You'd be disappointed, like I was, if you're looking for a primer on playing real country & blues songs. For the same amount of money, I'd get Arnie Berle's Beginning Fingerstyle Blues Guitar, which is much more substantive and more helpful if you ever want to get beyond the beginner's stage."
1,Easily broken,"A bought this mp3 player because it had a color screen, but a week later it craked and all i could see was this swirly blue and pink thing(like your calculator looks when you break it). And Samsung of course would never cover the waranty. I accepted that i couldnt get the screen fixed, but i figured as long as it still played music, it was good enough...two months later, it stoped working all together. It can't even turn on. I'm so disapointed with the quality of this, that i dont intend on buying another Samsung product anytime soon"
1,My last Koontz book for a while......,"I have found Koontz to be a masterful storyteller in all of the books that I have read by him (Phantoms, Watchers, From the Corner of His Eye, Intensity), but this book was horribly and unnecessarily wordy and cumbersome. The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided. Pray that this book comes out as a movie, b/c it will take you MUCH longer than two hours to needle through.Wanna read a wonderful book? Try ""The Weight of Water"" by Anita Shreve....it's wonderful!"
2,This is my third one-and I'd buy another!,"I've had 2 other types of frothers, but this is convenient/reliable and affordable...Lasts about 2 years (for me - with daily use). Use low fat milk and make sure it's nice and cold."
2,Largely Underappreciated,"Though it's not really fitting for a movie in the Alien series, Alien3 is an interestingly done if monochrome-looking exercise in religious allegory. Weaver handles the constantly changing role of Ripley well, combining both the independence shown in Alien with the maternal aspects of Aliens. This, combined with the rest of the cast and some effective camerawork, makes for what is at least an interesting film. It must be seen letterboxed for it to make any sense, however. The end of the movie (and what should have been the end of the series) is amazing, of course, and worth waiting for even if you find the preceding two hours unbearably dull. Give the film a second look (or a first!), but again, in its original Panavision format if possible; otherwise it becomes very visually garbled. END"
2,Cute flag,"We got this for my daughter's birthday. She loves everything Canada. It is really well made and she hung it up in her window. I really wish that it would come as curtains as well, but for a flag, it is perfect."
1,It was just...weird.,"The movie starts out as a good thriller movie. Then it stalls. Finally you realize there are only 15 min left and wonder where they plan on going with the film. By the end, I was thinking, ""That was it? Give me back the hour and a half of my life!"" Seriously, the preview is as good as it gets."
1,Very flashy,"The headphone has some good quality sound output but with this price tag, the material should be of a decent quality...mine broke with a minimal careful use with in a year...."
2,Love love love thi series.,I just love this series so much that I HAD to get the 2nd series. As soon as it arrived. It is an engrossing story. I can't wait for the next season.
1,Meh,"Nope. Lot's of accusations, conspiracy theories, and the like with little to no evidence to support their findings. Loud guys with blow-horns shouting at conferences. I felt like this film was one step away from promoting tin-foil hats and bomb-shelters. Just my two-cents."
1,Errors in Answers,"Although this book does a good job explaining, be careful - the solutions have MANY errors."
2,Common sense advice for practical Java,As the title implies this book is a scattershot of topics for improving your Java architecture and implementation patterns. Bruce is always practical and pragmatic in his approach and it's no different here. He covers test first development very well. There is also an excellent section on transparency. But much like a theme album this short book is supposed to be ingested whole. Definitely a must have for professional Java developers.
1,Politically Biased,"While this book purports to be an unbiased account of the foster care system and its impact on African-American children, it fails miserably. The author is biased against the system from the very beginning, and presents only stories that back her view of the system. There are definitely issues with the foster care system including: overworked case managers, lack of funds, inability to assist children in an appropriate fashion 100% of the time. Certainly there is a racial issue since the majority of children in foster care and up for adoption are minorities, but is this because of the foster care system itself or are we missing a major piece in the puzzle? It is this missing piece that is missing from Ms. Roberts' book."
1,"first it stopped cooling, then it just died","I thought this would be a perfect addition for patio parties. A week after installing, the sodas were barely cold. Today, the unit just died. I've had it maybe four months. What a waste of good money."
2,Stunning,"This is the only needlpoint book I have ever bought that had more than one or two designs that were worth making. The Magic Carpet, Tunisian and Oriental designs are all stunning and the author offers suggestions for multiple uses and colour schemes. I can't wait to get started!"
1,One of the two already NOT working on day one,"disappointed that on the first day, with limited usage that one of these are not working. The flashlight works so I know the batteries and connection are good.Will return. Hopefully for a new one."
2,I'm sold on Harry Harrison,"OK, I realize that the last two books in this series were written by someone other than the original author, Harry Harrison. But I do give him credit for the original idea that these books sprang from. I'm a sucker for alternate history stories, and this one is a good one. What makes it good is a fresh perspective--Vikings and English, rather than the Civil War, or Kennedy's assassination, or even the Roman Empire. I stumbled across an old Harry Harrison book in my personal library when I was looking for something to read, and was impressed by his mastery of writing. I am a Christian, and have always been aware of his anti-Christian bias (perhaps more anti-Church?), but that hasn't stopped me from enjoying these and other books by the old master.Harry, we hardly knew ye...."
1,Bad discription of inside of covers.,"I ordered these covers for my RCA 5 cables.The cables measured 1 1/2in they should of fit.They did not say there was clips on the inside,with a middle support.They only allow for 1/2 cable on each side,That left one cable on the outside.Had to return this product & order the 4in, hope it works,did not want to go so big. Very disappointed with the info,should of showed better pictures of the inside with clips.Now have to wait to finish my TV. More to come after install...."
1,*sigh* I guess it couldn't last forever,"No one is a bigger fan of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" than I am - I've read it cover-to-cover at least 10 times since 1996. And the same goes for the others in the series (especially ""The Mammoth Hunters"") which were all really great. I will not be rereading ""Shelters,"" I'm sorry to say. I got the impression that the whole story, inflated to over 700 pages, could have easily fit in the first 100 pages of the next book. All the conflict built up to in the last few books - especially the very big question of the Zelandonii's acceptance of Ayla and her Clan background and son - were dismissed entirely. Oops, I guess Jondalar didn't have reason to be worried after all. Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people's reaction. There's no story here - just constant introduction and repetition. Read it only if you plan to read the 6th, so you won't be lost in a maze of characters."
2,Charming Labels,I bought these labels at a store several years ago and used them up so I was delighted to find they were available at Amazon. The round labels are perfect for the lids on my homemade jam. They stick really well to the lids but they don't stick all that well to many other surfaces. They come in all sorts of shapes for a variety of uses.
1,Disappointing,"The book was disappointing considering the authors credentials. If you want to know details about why the Titanic sank, airline crashes, Three Mile island etc the book is fine. It dwells excessively on non-business failures. I would say most of those arent that relevant to business as usually business mistakes are made over a period of months/years and not some meltdown or imminent crash scenario as faced by airline pilots. The author tries to extrapolate these to business and falls flatThere is nothing insighful or meaningful and some things like Enron analysis is a re-hash of what we all know"
1,"Interesting, but plodding in the 2nd half","Interesting story; good description of Swedish society in the era, but the story downright plods during the ship passage to America. Would have been better if Moberg had made that relatively boring passage shorter and moved on past the landing in this part of the series. He spends a lot of pages describing the hopes and fears of each of the emigrants in the group; too much, in my opinion. This 1st novel in the series did not inspire me to get the rest and continue reading the entire story."
1,cheap,Yes its cheap but its not pure.Swanson claims they test their stuff for purity but you cannot get a copy of the results.I found contaminates in the product.
2,Great game,I go tell you what made me buy a type of bomberman.Blast your way thruogth levels by destroying your opponents with STRATEGICALLY place bombs .That rigth there made me buy bomberman online for dreamcast.This not as good as that vison but is still great and fun
2,"Another Great Mystery Mixes Tarot Cards, Satanism, and Murder","Second Book in David Skibbins' ""Tarot Card"" mysteries.Our hero Warren Ritter (aka Richard Greeene) has been running from his past as a member of the radical Weatherman Underground group in the 1960s. He's changed his name and gotten plastic surgery, and has moved to Berkeley, California where he works as a tarot card reader. Two people from his radical past show up, though, and blackmail Warren into investigating a series of murders involving the leadership of the Berkeley Church of Satan.Great characters and an excellent plot! I do recommend, however, that if you haven't read ""The Eight of Swords"", that you read it first. Warren's life is just too complicated to understand without reading the first book first."
2,Good but pricey,"PROS+ Very Precise+ Decent Grip (both for my fingers and for hairs)+ I have yet to perceive any reduced performance over time (I have almost had them for a year and use them at least twice a week)+ The tip guard is usefulCONS- Sharp, occasionally cuts hairs instead of pulling them- Expensive- The pointed tip really only seems good for me stabbing myself while trying to get a hair, not digging out ingrown hairs or anything useful. If the point was smoother, it might be more precise for ingrown hairs, but it is rather rough.Though they do have some flaws, these are some of the best tweezers I have ever owned."
2,Matt Morgan,"i finaly got this guy i got him cause i like his finisher move the ""Grand Bomber"" simalar 2 the ""batista Bomb"" he is a graet action figure his hair looks like the real ones but being hes like 7foot in real life his figure is the same sise as every other one even rey is as big is him and rey mysterio is the smallest wwe super star but matt morgan is still the best"
2,review,The album was so so. It was a double album and I didn't like the second cd. They put the tunes to what I believe was a latin beat.
1,not the best,"This bottle opener is too thin and doesn't work really good. sorry, but for the price what do you expect"
2,"Easy to install, works like champ","Easy to install. Very happy with product, no longer have rear glass falling on head. It has spring in it that when you start to lift window it kicks in and pulls it up for you. Need a little muscle to pull it back down to close."
1,The Return of the Heaven's Gate,"Jesus, Mary and Saint Joseph if this is not the most disturbingly off putting outfit (I won't call them a band)in recent years. They must live in a commune, grow their own food, and have no contact with the outside world other than when they tour, or recruit, or play music, or brainwash...Each time I see the commercial on TV with all these freaks singing and dancing about in bed sheet like robes, I want to push the tv over like Travis Bickle. This could possibly be the worst album and band I have ever had the misfortune of listening to. I hope the all kill themselves when the next comet comes. That bad."
1,Too Much Talk not enough action,"In the words of Paul Revere and the Raiders, this book has ""Too much talk and not enough action."" Would have made a good edited short story. To many conversations where the characters repeat themselves. Got bored with this."
2,syncronized thrash masterpiece of molten metal,"This is a fantastic thrash/speed metal album. 16 songs and every one of them kicks ass! this is true thrash metal, with lots of intricate guitar leads and tempo changes. drumming is out of this world! Most of th songs are based on the theme of REVENGE, hence the album title. The liner notes summarize ""this album is DEDICATED TO CHARLES BRONSON!"" yeah babay YEAH!!!"
2,Its About Time for this change,I admit it I've been a fan of Bone since the Faces of Death days truthfully probably their biggest fan but in all honesty Bone has disappointed me a few times. Its not their last few cds wasn't good its just that I know as well as all of you know that Bone can rip some trax when they want to. This cd (I hpe and pray) is a sign of their future cds because this cd is the first in a looooong time that I see them live up to their potential. They rip damn near every track almost as good as East 1999. This cd in my opinion is a great investment and a must have for every Bone fan or anyone who like fast tongue twistin rap. I give Bone nothing but love for this cd and pray that their next one is even just half as good.4.3 (its great but its no East 1999)
2,Very cool movie,This is the preferred edition over the previously released US theatrical version.I suggest you catch the various incidents of the movie fresh.
2,Zelly & Me video - heartwarming yet sad,"This movie was a favorite of my daughter, we watched it over and over back in the 80's. The love that the nanny had for this child was so unconditional -- and her parentals could certainly not measure up, with their lack of involvement in this child's life. Will always be a favorite. Isabelle Rosalini magnificent!"
1,Generic Boy Band Music...,"When will I ever learn? I bought the CD for the song ""Give me just one Night"" but, as is so often the case with modern boy bands (Backstreet Boys, Robbie Williams, Boyzone) the rest of the album is pure dreck...generic ""B"" side pablum, neither offensive nor particularly inspired. Save your money...buy the single and forget the album!"
2,The Warhol scene in their own words,"If you don't know much about the Factory scene, this is a great way to introduce yourself.If you are not a fan of Andy Warhol, these anecdotes will probably confirm your view.If you are a fan of Andy Warhol, some of these anecdotes might change your mind.But, of course, he would excuse himself by claiming to be merely a spectator.This book is about Warhol and the Factory scene, but also much more. If you appreciate Joan Didion's view of the Sixties, you will find much to mull over here. If your vision of the Sixties is founded on peace and love, you may want to look elsewhere for inspiration."
2,Satisfaction garantied,"My book came on time as told. Absolutly perfect condition.As usual, I am a satisfied customer....Thank You"
1,Disappointed,"I bought iRobot Roomba (red) in 2005. I have had nothing but trouble with it. I have already replaced the battery. I clean it just as instructed after each use (a pain). I was prepared to love it. My apartment is small with wooden floors and very little furniture, just perfect for an iRobot. This machine should have lasted longer. I am ready to junk it. I have not been able to get it to work without problems for over a year now. I believe it is poorly made. I have not gotten any response when I call the company."
2,Just Like Dora,"A good story for pre-readers. Dora and her friends follow a type of obstacle course to get to a surprise party in the end. There is plenty of word repetition and only 3-4 words on each page yet this book is able to form a cohesive storyline. It helps reinforce new words and build sight vocabulary. The repeated words are action words so it is fun to act out as well as read aloud and really includes the child in the story. My 2-year-old, an avid Dora lover, ""reads"" this book to herself and loves the ending. It is very short which could be good or bad depending on the amount of times your child will demand to have it read to them... it gets better when they can read it themselves. Good character book."
1,Samsung remote control sucks,"I bought the TV during thanksgiving sale. The TV looks and feels all right. One of the major disappointments is the remote control. I had a few AV device at home, a sony VCR, panasonic DVD player, dishnetwork receiver box. The remote control is claimed able to work with all the device if you follow the instructions in the mannual. However when I actually try it, it does not work with any of them. Finally, I called Samsung customer service, the answer from them is that I am out of luck if it does not work.It is just plain ridiculous. If samsung could not get a $10 remote control to work, they should at least OEM it to people manufacturing universal remote controls. For God's sake, what is the price that the TV is selling at."
1,Do not buy!,This is the second 1500 I purchased. I returned the first one and now the second one is working. I own two of the 600's which outperform the 1500. Very disappointed with this product. Buyer beware!
2,Play this LOUD!,"Those West Country thrash merchants deliver another slice of bowel-loosening rawk in this, their finest album to date.There's a solid grunge undercurrent, a hint of melodic death metal (occasional growls and whimpers) and an overall country bumpkin aesthetic (black waistcoats and red neckerchiefs).The songs themselves are an unusual mix of high-octane, head-banging numbers and synth-licked ballads, which deal with everything from the joy of stamp collecting to the dangers of Estonia's current monetary policy.However, the real strength of the Wurzels is singer and lead axe-man, Phil (pictured on the right), with his earthy, operatic voice he delivers stirring, anthemic tones that will make your ears bleed - brilliant!"
2,ILUMINA TU INTERIOR Y TU VIDA...,"QUE ESO FUE LO QUE LOGRÉ LEYENDO ESTE LIBRO MARAVILLOSO !Ya no me levanto triste, ni cansada ni de mal humor...ME ENSEÑÓ LA ALEGRIA DE VIVIR CONMIGO MISMA Y CON LOS DEMÁS¡Qué hermosa puede ser nuestra vida !"
1,Good book for novice C programmers,"I'd recommend this book for novice C programmers, people with two or less years of coding experience. However, this 1989 book focuses on pre-ANSI C, so the novice would need to be guided by someone that knows the history of C. Some of his statements are false when applied to ANSI C with prototypes (e.g., p.139, it _is_ possible to pass a char argument, if there is a function prototype). I read through and did the problems in this slim book in about three hours. It does have a few nuggets of value, and introduced me to a bug I'd not seen before, the reverse of the ""= for =="" bug:while( (x == fgetc(f)) != EOF )"
1,Indigo Prophecy Review,"Ok, so this game was the best game I had ever played until about 2/3 of the way through it, then it became the worst game I had ever played. The infamous Indigo Prophecy syndrome exists, and this is where it all began...Story is excellent until the middle, and the mechanics are hard to master, but that is a good element to the game.As for buying the game? Probably not worth more than $20.00 maybe even less at this day and age.Thrilling and worth the effort to play, but looking it up on wikipedia is probably sufficient."
2,JUST ABOUT PERFECT -- TO BE CREATIVE IS TO BE FULLY ALIVE,"An absolute gem.Don't miss this terrific film about what it means to really risk being alive.It's about a lot of other things as well:Connecting and creating.Finding harmony with another.Making something beautiful.Discovering a friendship without an agenda.Getting real.Loving yourself enough to heal the hurt.But mainly, this beautiful, unexpected movie is the best film I've seen about the creative process of discovering the song within and letting it out.And what music means.It is just about perfect.Highest recommendation."
2,Sounds like the Herb Schildt of Flash!,"Based on reviews, sounds like the Herb Shildt of Flash! The definitive, reference-quality tome that other Flash writers will turn to is the one to own. Herbert Schildt is the master of C and C++ programming books, with a careful style and thoroughness in every single function. It seems like Colin Moock may be a master in his own right."
2,Defective Product,"La Crosse Technology WT-3122A 12 1/2-Inch Wood Atomic Analog ClockDefective Product. Love the quality appearance and construction. Installed on wall easily. Time set quickly and properly and kept perfect time until ""sprint forward"" time. Clock set to new time properly and worked for some hours, then the hour and minutes hands began to advance as if to reset time again. The only way to make them stop was to take out batteries. But they started back up again when batteries were reinserted. The same thing happened with my other La Crosse atomic clock purchase through Amazon Sep 2011. Likely some internal logic flaw."
1,Doesn't survive the test of time,"I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention."
2,Great,"This is a great item! Beware that the sun has to directly hit it. They only workout house during the summer because that's when our windows get hit with direct sun light, but very pretty when they work."
1,looks good unless you use it,"I bought the Sony because it seems better made than many of the other portable DVD players I looked at. I like the black case and the compact battery. However, despite its good looks, it does not work well.1. The sound is very poor. 2. Picture is very dark, lots of reflections and hard to get the screen at a good angle to see the movie well. I like to be able to SEE and HEAR my movies!!!"
2,Delphi Trans Solenoid,I highly recommend this product. I replaced both solenoids in my 2000 Olds Bravada transmission and took it out for a test drive and it shifted perfectly.
2,Real Plug and Play,"Plugged it in and my Series 2 DT popped up a config screen, entered my WPA password and I was good to go. Simple set and good range."
1,I cannot read this book because of scratches.,"It is really old book and previous owner draw a line almost all over the book. So it is hard to read this book. I bought this book for my brother in Japan. I believed the quality because I believe the Amazon, so I send this to my brother right after I got this book. After he open this he really angry at me. It was my fault send it without checking, but I really disappointed. I could not imagine that kind of book condition, because I didn't buy a book in *bed quality."
1,Trash.,"Complete trash, waste of time, inaccurate, fiction, just another attempt of leeching off of the blood of the Tate/Labianca/Hinman/Shea murders and of course using the name ""Manson"" to garner interest. If you want to know about this case, there are no movies that lay it out factually. GO read a book, read them all and piece the story together. Most of the books are also not very accurate, use common sense. Avoid trash like this piece of crap movie."
1,Too full of themselves,While some of the information was good and interesting almost all of the characters talked like they were so sure of themselves and their opinions were the only right ones.
2,Ravaged by boy bands? Find solace under the rainbow.,"When I first listened to Mariah Carey's Rainbow, I was bored by it. I favored the brighter, bubblegum-packed tracks of the infamous boy bands. But months later, after finally struggling out of their forceful grasp, I reconsidered the Cd and felt quite different about it than I had initially. After being brainwashed by inadequate voices and simple lyrics, I was rather impressed by Mariah's capabilities. Not only does she have the most amazing voice, but she can actually write intelligent songs. Tracks such as ""Can't Take That Away"", ""After Tonight"" and ""Petals"" are sung with such convincing emotion that you'll find yourself swept up into Mariah's triumphs and tragedies. And whenever the taste for a little bubblegum comes back, there are a few tracks like ""Heartbreaker"" to satisfy the craving."
2,A forced upgrade,"Ok, I ran my business just fine using Quickbooks Pro 2004. I even used Quickbooks for payroll processing and direct deposit. No problem.Then comes along the email messages... my current copy will soon become obsolete, no longer supported, and I won't be able to use their payroll processing.But wait, there's a solution... just buy our latest version.No discounts for current users, ouch. At least I can save $50 by going through Amazon instead of the Quickbooks site. Quite sad really.The software works just fine. It's been reformatted and it doesn't take too long to get used to it, but I'd rather focus on growing my business instead of learning software I'm forced to upgrade."
2,They have done it again...,"What can I say?! It is action packed from the very beginning to the end. Lots of the same weapons, a lot more ""mazes"" to find your way out of. I would have put a rating of ""5"", but the ending was disappointing. The creators could have ended it differently...but that's just my opinion. Of course, I won't give it away, but if and when you get there, you'll know what I mean. It leaves you wondering why there isn't something else... For those of you who like to try this game on different levels, you will definitely like this game...just don't get frustrated. The ""hard"" level is so incredibly hard, it seems as though you will never get passed the first mission. SO, Go ahead, give it a try... :)"
1,"Good ideas, bad presentation","I was required to purchase and use this book for an Oracle database design class.Although the authors are experienced DBAs and have good ideas on database design and implementation, they convey their ideas rather poorly. They don't deal with topics one at a time and jump from one idea to the next at times within one paragraph. This book has good ideas, but one has to read this book several times and also must be an intermediate to an advanced level Oracle developer to get the most out of it."
2,A Coffee Table and Not a Pulpit.,"As an artist, I am immensely grateful for the New Kind of Christian trilogy. Brian McLaren steps away from brokering knowledge and chooses instead to ignite a conversation. There's humility here--a pastor who isn't looking for the last word in his writing. This book deserves careful study because though the chapters race by, the questions move in, find the spare rooms in our minds, and start unpacking their suitcases. They're going to be here a while."
1,"Been There, Done That!","I am a huge fan and I like to complete my collections with anything that my favorite artists release, but I am so tired of the uninspired ""comeback"" shows with companion cd's. Although I love the songs on this cd, I have to say that it will take more than 1 new song to make me pay $25 for this release. I work hard for my money and don't condone these old heavyweights pandering us for our money with old material whenever their funds run a little low. Roger Waters is one of the most gifted songwriters in rock, but also one of the laziest. There is nothing here for anyone under the age of 30 to relate to. Most of these songs were written DECADES AGO. Roger needs to write some new stuff or loose the declining base of 35+ yr olds fans he has left."
2,Great book for the new CBT Therapist!,"I am reading this book for my CPPR class in graduate school. Before I started, I only knew the very basics of CBT, and have found this book to be written in an interesting and understandable way that is easy to follow. Beck provides lots of examples to help you understand every step of the process.Highly recommend!"
1,Get the MZNHF800 instead,"Even though the 800 doesn't have a backlight, it has a radio, and uses a single AA battery instead of the dorky proprietary Sony NiMH + screw-on single AA battery adapter on the 900."
1,Not worth it,"The first time I used the dashboard mount, it slid right off my rounded dashboard during a normal left turn. Stick with the windshield mount that comes with the Garmin."
2,Leather? Who cares; great bag!,"Is it leather or isn't it? It might be, but Who cares, it's great. Very easy to open, and great practical storage areas."
2,Gem of a Cooker!,"Anything that makes cooking easier, is for me! I enjoy eating hard boiled eggs, but really dislike the odor, when cooking them. This egg cooker has much less odor, if any, when cooking the eggs. The compact size, quick cooking time and easy clean up, make this a real gem. Using this is so much easier than boiling eggs in a pot, timing and waiting/watching until they're done, hoping none break etc. Krups Egg Cooker lets you know when the eggs are done with a buzzer and they're always perfect. It also has a keep warm feature, which is nice when you're making other things for breakfast at the same time. Even storage is a snap, it has a place on the base to wrap the cord, so it's not hanging out. I think this would make a great little gift for your favorite cook, including one for yourself!"
2,bedtime story,"I love that the movie evolved from a bedtime story he told his kids. It reminded me of the tone the Neverending Story and the feeling it left me with. I loved this movie. ""They"" need to stop marketing his movies like a bundle and stand behind his individual creations. I would really give this 4 1/2 instead of 4 stars."
2,Best Overall functionality,Works in Windows XPAllows creation of image on network driveWorks in older Windows as wellSoftware setup issues typical for Windows softwareIt works for me
2,better than 1 and 2,"i think the first CD is considerably better than the 2ndmany of the songs have a good backbeat with excellent female vocals perfect on the dance floorthe best songs on the CD are:At the End (classic Iio with great vocals and backbeat)Diving (4 Strings in my opinion is always able to pull out a good song - Diving is one of my favorites)I Should Know (Despite the male vocalist, it was still a fairly good song, as it jut gives you an overall good feeling)"
2,On Meds? This book is a MUST for you!,"If you or a loved one is taking one or more medications, then this book must reside in a handy location. Find out which nutrients your medications deplete from your system. Exhausted and dragging when you're on an antibiotic? Find out why. Then you can supplement your body with the appropriate nutrients, vitamins, minerals, etc. Feel like your normal self again. Get the benefits of your meds and know what you need to do to replace what those meds take away from you. An absolute must if you're in the health and nutrition distribution business, as well!"
2,Simple but nice,"These are nice glasses. They have a decent weight to them (I am not a fan of the ultra light glasses). The blue stem is pretty. The way the stem curves into the glass is nice you can securely hold it and not touch the glass too much...I've been told you should hold a martini by the stem because the heat from your fingers warms your drink faster (yeah yeah not sure I believe it but...), anyway it feels like a nice little support it isn't ackward like i was worried about."
2,Tammy Wyanette,"Tammy has the most unique voice I have ever heard from a female singer, my wife and I love her voice and all of her music."
1,for 1994 oldsmobile Bravada vortec 4.3L,"did not fit the valve covers, they are too big. was advertised to fit. I cut to size and used RTV sealant, the package said once opened you can not return. so I had to make do."
1,Ludlum Shmudlum...when do we get a new plot?,"OK so I am against the popular vote, but give me a grabber with a new plot that doesnt twist predictably and I'll 5 star it. Go read for a quick sleeping pill. BH"
1,I Can't Believe I Paid...,"I liked Thank U for about the first ten listens, then I hated it. I hated all of the other songs on the disc after two listens. Anybody got any of Alanis' bubblegum pop CDs from her pre-Jagged Pill days? It's got to be better than what's on ""Junkie"".By the way, Alanis, if you're going to put a nude body in your CD, make it that of another Canadian, Pamela Anderson Lee!"
1,"Some good info, but seems biased","The Fanthorpes explore the Rennes mystery, and offer some good information in this book. However, it isn't always presented clearly and some of the theories and conclusions they draw from it don't seem fully supported. I was left with the impression that the book was half Rennes investigation, and half platform from which to denounce Holy Blood, Holy Grail. It's not surprising (given Lionel's clergy background) that they would disagree with Holy Blood, Holy Grail's conclusions. But this potential bias must be remembered when reading it, and their dismissive tone when talking about some of the more controversial theories about Rennes needs to be taken with a corresponding grain of salt. If they offered counter-evidence convincingly presented, that would be a different matter. Instead, their otherwise interesting investigation seems marred by jabs at other investigators...usually countering other investigators' arguments with faith instead of evidence."
1,it broke in 2 weeks,"It worked really well for 2 weeks, and then just stopped working. I dont think i treated it unkindly---i kept it in my pocket next to my cellphone.Maybe if i had treated it more gingerly it would have lasted longer. But what's the point of this form factor if you have to baby it?"
1,Receiver shuts off by itself,The forerunner 305 receiver occasionally shuts off by itself without warning. This is really annoying and affects your data at the end of your workout. I have seen this complaint in other forums as well. Shouldn't there be a recall or fix for this?! Some forum claims that this happens when you coast at the end of the lap or when in traffic or at a stop light. I hope there's a place in the receiver to adjust this auto shut-off annoyance.
1,Sad but true,I have all the Plasmatics albums and many of the EPs. They are my favorite band of all time. The Plasmatics were by far the most outrageous band of the last century and Wendy was one in a million. All the Plasmatics albums rock except this one. I am glad I have the Maggots CD just to add it to my collection but I never listen to it. I will admit some hardcore metal fans might like it. It is better than Twisted Sister and Poison but it is no Metal Priestess.
2,A picture is worth a 1000 words and lot less pain!,"Although somewhat expensive, the video showed what I was doing wrong on the snatch and other techniques although I had read the book, ""The Russian Kettlebell Challenge."" Thus I improved my technique and reduced the pain suffered during Kettlebell workouts. Bravo, Pavel!"
2,Funny and thought provoking - a Tour de Force of talent.,"I througly enjoyed seeing Robert De Niro tackle a comedic role, something I've rarely seen him do before. Ben Stiller is no slouch either and is the consumate funny man himself. Meet the Parents touches on both the funny side of meeting the inlaws, and the more serious issues of parents letting go of their little girl. As a male nurse, Stiller's character challenges DeNiro's friends definition of status (they're doctors) and gender roles by being proud of his professional choices. Meet The Parents left me rolling on the floor laughing and yet at the same time it made me think. Excellent indeed!"
1,not really intended for wider laptops,"My hubby bought this for me for much cheaper than this listed as a temporary lap table for use in bed and the couch. Although the spaces on the sides are nice the table top is indented and if your laptop is the wider kind it will not ""fit"" and slide. If you use this in bed careful if you move around (changing position ect) cause it gets off balance and falls backward. (note the legs are narrowed). Based off this one I am looking for one that is wider, has a wider leg stance. This would be GREAT for kids !!!"
1,The Chipmunks?,"I can't go higher than 2 stars on a CD set that includes The Chipmunks. People, this was released in 2006.Sure, they made it the last track on Disc 1 because they really knew it didn't belong there at all, but they were probably shooting for 36 tracks and the price was right.If you plan on ripping the CD, you'll have the option of yanking the Chipmunks. Otherwise you'll have to suffer through them every time Jingle Bell Rock ends."
2,Better as romance than slapstick,"The Bottom Line:A serious film that's marred by some underwhelming scenes of slapstick (though to be honest the boxing scene is really pretty well done), City Lights deserve to be remembered for the wonderfully sweet scenes between the blind woman and the tramp, not the crazy hijinks that ensue for the other half of the film.3/4"
1,High Entertainment Value,"I read this book many years ago and recall being hugely amused by it and its numerous stereotypes. In fact, I gave it to a sociology PhD candidate studying Chinese culture for a good laugh. I regret parting with it because it is quite a unique artifact, being quite comprehensive in its stereotypes of various Asian nationalities. Nevertheless, I can see the value of the book for those completely unfamiliar with Asian culture and desperately grasping for some way to categorize what seems to be inexplicable behavior, since the first response to unfamiliarity is to attempt to build categories to group and generalize. As such, I might recommend it, but only with the caveat that its contents should not be taken as authoritative."
1,Fun but...,"I have to say I'm disappointed. The ""new"" Creating Keepsakes (CK) fonts advertised are not really new at all - they're from CK's original font collections, which I already own. The CK art, too, is from their CD packages. Like another reviewer stated, the whole workspace and basic set-up really isn't any different than other Broderbund programs, either. I just invested in the new Printmaster version - this program isn't very different at all. The main advantage I see is its ability to create layouts/projects in 12x12, except I don't have a printer that can do that.It's a good program if you don't already own anything by CK or any of Broderbund's creativity software, but I give the program 2 stars because of its lack of originality and what I consider to be deceptive advertising."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought what I thought was a RETAIL DVD-RW external enclosure but what I got was a BenQ internal drive put in an external encloser that even BenQ wont support ................. Watchout for this guy he's a rippoff artist
2,My son loves it!,"I have 3 DVD's in this series, and toddler tunes is my favorite. My 12 month old loves to watch and dance along. I like him watching real kids do kid stuff instead of cartoon figures. The songs have great messages and are the ones I grew up with. (I am learning a lot of 2nd and 3rd verses that I didn't know existed.) A must have for anyone with kids."
2,Crunchy Treat,"I give these to my shar-pei instead of rawhide and he enjoys them a lot. They are dehydrated cow tails, so there are little crunchy bones inside of them. If your dog tends to gobble up things quickly or if you have a smaller type dog, I would probably opt for something else. I have had no problems giving them to my dogs (I also have a Doberman) who chew them slowly though. I like these because they do not contain four, corn, or other junk typical dog treats have."
2,Just as expected,"Set up was easy (just screw the arms to the bottom of the shelf and then bend to fit to the back of the dryer) and keeps my various boxes and bottles off the top of the dryer but still in easy reach.I love this setup b/c I live in an older home and can't easily hang shelves in the basement. These shelves fit easily on the back of my older washer and dryer (yeah, they're from 1978-I affectionately call them Harvest Gold Beasts). The ONLY reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that in the rare occasion that I just completely filled the washer lopsided (like if I'm washing a pillow or something awkward like that) and the washer starts to ""walk"" it can push the back of the shelf up against the wall and knock everything off of it. I've had one shelf for almost a year and that's only happened once when I washed 2 pillows and they both moved to the same side of the machine during the spin cycle (total user error on my part, I should have watched it a bit more closely)."
1,Zero Tech Suppot,"I bought this item 5 months ago. I followed the instructions on the included ""Quick Start"" card regarding the battery, which was to top it off every week if not using it. The battery now lasts 4 minutes. When I went to write INOi the FIRST time, I opened the pdf version of that card that was on the disk to include the erroneous instructions. Guess what, they are not on that version. I've written to INOi twice and they have not answered, I can't find a battery for it anywhere. I now have a $150 piece of junk - other firms market this type of device - look elsewhere."
2,"Great binoculars, great price","I was looking for inexpensive, but functional, binoculars to use with school groups in outdoor settings. These binoculars are WAY better than I expected for the price. The optics are crisp and the binoculars are easy to focus with the rocker-type focus (easier for kids than a dial that has to be turned). They are relatively small and lightweight (given the power). To be nit-picky, the only minor disadvantage is that they have lens caps that do not have straps to hold them to the binoculars, but that's the case with most of the binoculars that I have already. So...I'll set aside the caps and not worry about taking them into the field. The neck strap is a basic, narrow webbed strap, although the strap on the case is wider and potentially more comfortable for extended carrying."
2,Use the remote,"For quality pictures photographers prefer to use a tripod and cable release. The C2000 does not include a socket for the cable release; the answer is to use the remote to avoid camera shake when activating the shutter. It seems strange to put a ten-ounce camera on a ten-pound tripod, but it works great. (Incidentally, only use the LCD for composing in close-up mode, the batteries last forever.)"
1,just bored me,boring andi hate seeing how movies are made i like to be surprised when im going to watch a movie
1,piece of crap,"d-link needs to get its act together. this router of airplus is a laugh. never seen so much problems from one equipment. lost connection, rebooting itself every half hour, losing signal, rebooting computer to get back signal. returned twice over a span of 3 weeks. fianlly returned back for good for another brand. a linksys speedbooster. now that works great!!tech support wasn't helpful either..spent more time on phone with tech than anybody else. still didn't get the problem solved. each one kept telling me to return the router back and get another one after there book runs out of troublehsooting ideas. tired of that...:( the tech needs help with updatng there knowledge of the equipment and manners. d-link needs to rebuild there router again.its not worth it......buy a linkys speedbooster or netgear instead."
1,Bluffed into buying it,"My review is two thumbs down. It might help a total novice at the game, but it provides nothing for people who know anthing about poker."
1,Row away from this one as fast as you can!!!,"This book is a prime example of why maritime subjects should be written about by maritime historians.ERRORS! ERRORS! ERRORS! ERRORS! So, so many errors. If you want to get a distorted, sensationalized version of the Titanic, watch the Cameron film. If you want to get a distorted, sensationalized version of the Lusitania, READ THIS piece of ....The best part of this book is the title--An Epic Tragedy. Believe me, that's the best three-word description of Preston's big screw-up.(Note to publisher--if you want to publish inaccurate garbage, I can dig out a few of my old junior high reports that are apparently worthy of being circulated. I could use the $$$)"
2,excellent,"I read a review where an individual stated that ""this work was outdated'. Well the ancient druids certainly 'are' and here is a good collection of their history! It seems the more and more I read reviews of Matthews work I come across the complaint that its ""dry history'. While this may be true there are also gems within the desert if one cares to look. Also all the books that I've ever read about ""druid magic, techniques, shamanism etc...I have found to be worthless and just a dressed up version of wicca. The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom is another example of fine writing and research. Once again we must remember this was""an oral tradition""."
1,This can be done a lot cheaper,"Instead of purchasing the conversion kit and a spare battery(total of $80) you would be better off sticking with the AA versionand of the radio, and blowing $30 to $40 on a NiMh charger and eight batteries. This combination gives you over 30 hrs of operation on three AA size NiMh batteries vs. only 11 hrs with the Motorola kit. This way you will also have rechargable AA batteries available for flashlights, cameras, games, toys, etc..."
1,punch drunk,"This book is so worthless it's barely worth the effort to denigrate! Cashill, an allegedly human construction/cyborg, tries his best to rewrite the last fifty or so years of American history. Ignore him. If you're interested in The Greatest (yeah, Cashill-tron, Ali is the Triple Greatest of All Time! Of All Time!), read David Remnick's King of the World. If interested in MLK, Taylor Branch's remarkable biography. If interested in Robots, watch Lost in Space...."
1,Surf City Teresa - PLEASE DON'T STEREOTYPE GIRLS,"I consider Surf City Teresa very mediocre. I wouldn't reccomend it to children with vicious dogs, cats, or other animals that might choke on the doll's shredded head, hair, feet, or other parts that easily come off. It is not very fun for children with little imagination, as the dolls can get boring and end up either with their heads pulled off, in the ""Barbie Pile"", or fed to the bulldog. As Barbie Dolls go, they can get boring after awhile and are not educational.(...)"
1,Too complicated,These text messengers are way too complecated. The messages routinely don't go through. Even when following the directions exactly many of the functions don't work correctly. I couldn't even get the time and date to reset correctly. Definitely don't waste your money.
1,Oops.. She should'nt have done it again,"Thank goodness this girl is cute because that is all I can say for her. This CD is full of tired rhythm tracks, sloppy ballads(Dear Diary), and bad singing. The title song is listenable but only once. I did'nt know where she was coming from with the RollingStones remake(Satisfaction). It seems so out of place and awkwardly done. I received the CD as a gift and believe me,they should'nt have."
2,"In the modern era, Spidey is still the best!","Having been a huge fan of Amazing Spider-man since the age of 6, (1967 and still read it today!) I wasn't sure about the Ultimate series. I was pleasantly surprised! The story of Peter and his alter-ego has never been better. The artwork is outstanding. The stories stay true to the spirit of Spidey and still adapt it to the modern world that teens reside in today. It may sound incredibly strange, but Spider-man was the hero and inspiration that got me through the tough high school years. If I was a teen today, Ultimate Spider-man would provide the same service. This is a must for any true Spidey fan."
1,Wait for the next version,"I enjoyed German I & II, however I am having problems with German III. The flow is great between the previous CDs but the presentation leaves much to be desired.In German I & II the conversations were great with inflection in the speakers voices that could lead you to believe you were listening to a real conversation. In German III it is obvious the speakers are reading sentences on a page and have no idea how their sentences are to be put togather.The guy who says, ""Sagen Sie"" and ""Fragen Sie"" sounds like he is about to fall asleep. My CDs seem to have been made in 1998 by recording the cassettes from 1994 onto CDs. (You can hear the poor quality of tape compared to CDs.)I recommend waiting until 2004 when the new version is out for this product. German I & II have a copyright after 2000."
2,A Delightful book,"Sometimes Naughty, Sometimes Nice by Kimberly Raye is a delightful, sexy romp.Xandra Farrel thought she had the perfect relationship but when she is dumped she is not so sure. As the owner of Wild Woman, Inc. she personally tests all the new toys for women. Now she needs a test subject and sets her sights on her high school crush Beau Hollister. The man who was too quick their one time together.Beau Hollister has been on a mission to get his renovation company on the map. He is hired by Xandra to redo her home. Xandra is a walking fantasy and something Beau feels he needs to avoid. But when Xandra decides to get her man Beau is in a heap of trouble.Beau and Xandra both have issues from their past to work through. It was hilarious and deliciously steamy watching them become a couple.This is the second book I have read by this author and I am looking forward to many more to come. Especially Eve's story."
2,a series that will satisfy. . .,"I am most definitely pleased with this trilogy. From the beginning I was pulled into these books. The first book, Uglies, was full of excitement, the most thrilling book of this trilogy, and(as I always am with sci-fi)I was forever trying to learn more about Tally's world. The next book, Pretties, was a bit less exciting, but a very good book, none the less. I thought this second book seemed a sort of standstill, kind of a stall between the cliff-hanger beginning and the climatic ending, though still a good read and a necessary piece to this series. The final book was probably my fav., and, I thought, the most complex piece to this 3-part story."
2,"Good quality, as expected from Nikon brand name","Got this after I tried a couple of Meade binoculars. Came with a nice little pouch. Nicely coated lenses with good, clear image, even though the Brightness Index is only 6.25(by dividing the magnification, 10, into the objective lens diameter, 25, then find the square of the quotient. A BI of around 50 means the image you see thru the binocular is as bright as if you look with naked eyes. A standard for night time use.)I believe it's water proof or at least splash proof, though never tested it for that. I'd wish the body were made out of metal instead plastic. But I guess for the price ... that's too much to ask for. Overall I'm quite satisfied."
1,Worthless,"This reprint of what should be Schwartz's masterpieces are utterly worthless without the original artwork. The point of Schwartz's work was the true terror it inspired - if you want to emotionally coddle your children with ""less scary"" art, then why are you reading them horror stories to begin with?"
2,Remebering,"Fusion: SizzleI remember seeing this movie as a young woman. I liked the premise of the story, but I also really liked the alien -- Tom Tryon. He later became an author of several horror novels -- ""The Other"" and ""Harvest Home"". The movie is entertaining, and I enjoyed it."
1,A Proxy for Poor Little Rich Girl,"I call it a proxy, since this self-expose is absent any real feeling about what was in Jane's mind, other than daddy didn't love her enough. One has to figure the drama employed was inserted by a good, real good, editor. Hat's off to him or her, or them.Admittedly, I bought the book to get the chance to look into a dark soul. What makes people like this tick? There isn't much to find there once you sift the real from the expert editor. What made Jane sit smiling on the seat of an NVA anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down US pilots? What made Jane provide several radio Hanoi broadcasts, in which she called US airmen ""criminals""? What made Jane, who met the tortured POW's, call them liars even after their release from their torturous ordeal?You won't find it in this book. Only the highly edited ramblings of a poor little rich girl, who still doesn't get it.Such a shame, I was hoping for more. After all, there is no statute of limitations on treason."
2,Unbelievable,"One of the best movies that I have ever seen. The acting is fantastic and the storyline is great. Romance, suspense, turmoil, tragedy, sacrifice, this movie has it all. Not your typical action or romance movie by any stretch of the imagination. It will not disappoint viewers."
2,"Love him, love his voice...","There is a very good reason why once turned on to Michael Crawford, us MC fans love him forever. When you listed to this CD, you'll join the club, too.The voice of an angel that only gets better with time."
2,Happy Camper,"I received my copy of Life in a very timely manner, the product was in very good shape. I owned a copy of life in a vhs fomat,dvd is better I will buy again in the future."
1,Even for a seventeen-year-old....,"This is among the worst fantasy books I have ever read, and it infuriates me that it is getting so much attention. I could possibly forgive the utter lack of ingenuity of its plot or the language, which is more suited for a 7-year-old, if only I saw some signs of the author caring about the quality of his book. Unfortunately, it is obvious for the entire first third of the book that it was not even edited for basic grammar, and I find it insulting."
1,Binchy needs to stick to short stories,"I have being reading Binchy since she first wrote her short stories "" Dublin 4, and London Transports"", as well as her colum in the Irish Times, but over the years, the books she has come out with have got worse. Her first novel ""Light a Penny Candle"" was good but it has being a painstaking experience reading all the trash that has followed. Maeve, please go back to the short stories, you are great at it."
1,disappointed,"This was my least favorite of Dietrich's books. Slow moving and predicable, not near as engaging and fun as the Nathan Gage series"
1,If it walks like a duck...,"...and sounds like a duck, especially if it goes ""QUACK QUACK:, then it's a duck. This book is a load of horsefeathers. Frequent enemas to cure psoriasis? High colonics? Here's the best piece of advice psoriasis sufferers can ever receive that the book doesn't address in the detail it should: REDUCE STRESS. That's it. No all-apple diets, no enemas. Reduce stress. Examine your psychological state. Are you a nervous person? Do you worry about things all the time? That's your problem. You don't need this book to help. Yes, use the topical oils and listerine for the scalp for short-term relief. But a book on stress reduction and a regular dose of anti-anxiety medication or therapy will truly be your best friend if you want relief from psoriasis."
2,"Realy good, but they could do better","These is an excellent set, TFal usually last a lot and are extremely practical to cook in. This is a good complete set and I am very happy with it. However some minor details kept me from giving it 5 stars:- only the fry pans have the premium anti-scratch bottoms, the sauce pans have regular teflon (still work great in my opinion)- the glass lids only fit the sauce pans, they are to small for the fry pans- The way the handles are attached to the pans and lids sauces can get under the place where they are screwed in and it is almost impossible to clean..and on the glass lids you can actually see where it is dirty if you don't clean it properly."
2,"Statistical, factual information on boaters' preferences","Simple, straight forward book. A compilation of many different issues surrounding life on a boat, with the numeric results of the opinions of several thousand boaters. It compiles the experience of those that use their boats day in and day out, so it is a very valuable source of info on what works, what does not and what will break next."
2,Will We See Tomorrow,"This is one of the best WWII German autobiographies i have come across. It describes young soldiers adventures from boot camp to last days of Russian offensive, including action, humor and tragedy throughout the whole book. Defenitly worth a read as it includes an insight from a German cavlary soldier during WWII, describes the progress of the Russian campaign accuratly and keeps the reader in suspence from the cover to cover."
2,My kids love it.,"I have no clue how they found this show but they like it. There is no educational value and it really is for older kids. I purchased it because my little guy only asked for this at Christmas...talk about rock and hard place. From what I see there is nothing bad for the little guy, but some of the cartoon work/jokes are for older kids."
2,Great CD,"I bought ""Colma"" about a month ago and I love it. There are a few songs I don't like that much but most are awesome. It's fun to listen to and play guitar along with. Buckethead means business when he plays."
1,Rugged universal is well built but it is really to large to meet my requirments the smaller version is what i really wanted.,The unit i got is very rugged but i really needed the smaller size one for my insulin pump storage on my person while working if you could send me information i will order the smaller version as i am still using my old worn case for in use storage of my insulin pump > I would appreciate a reply to my e-mail address about another smaller size if possible . Thank you if the smaller one fits as i hope i will pass information along to the pump users in my group for future orders that stand up to the rugged use by pumpers at aa great price. Thanks Terrance Thompson E mail TTnLL@aol.com
2,WOW,The single most comfortable saddle I have ever had. I love this thing. Great for my twenty mile commute every day.
1,Too Quick and Stressfull,"I LOVE workout videos and because of them I got in the best shape of my life without a gym... Well now im pregnant... You can still do so much, but have to be safe about it thats why im still buying videos, but pregnancy ones & walking daily. I did not enjoy this at all, it was so QUICK and stressfull. The exercises are what they should be, but i would not get this one. Trust me when i say get Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout. Different things work for different people because everyones brain and body are different, this is just not for me. Good luck to all you pregnant ladies :)"
1,Save Your Money,Totally useless product. Not one of their claims has any truth. Don't waste your money on this product.
1,Service for this machine is no longer available!,FYI Earthlink is no longer providing mailstation service for any previously supported mailstation machines. No new accounts and exisiting customers cannot change their account to a new/replacement machine. We just found out about this after purchasing a new machine for our mom. Please remove your ad and do not sell these machines - they are of no use - now junk.
1,Not good...,"This book looks, reads and feels thrown together. The logo designs and shapes presented look as if they were produced in a middle school design class. Stay away from this book, I would not even suggest it to beginners."
1,It would be great - if we could actually do anything,"It would be a great game if you could do what it says on the box. You need money and the problem is, you are never given enough. It has too much complicated financial stuff in it and before you even know it, you are bankrupt. Most of my time is spent waiting for money levels to rise. It would be a great game, if they actually let you DO anything. The sky is not the limit, its the money. Do NOT buy this game!"
2,Love this iron!,"Used this curling iron for the first time yesterday and I have to say that I love it! I curl my hair often and until now I used a Conair Instant Heat curling iron. This iron is so much easier to use, and it really feels like it's smoothing your hair, not gripping or pulling. The 1 1/2 inch size is great too, especially for those with long hair. I didn't use any hairspray so the curls fell out over the course of the day, but my hair just looked like it had been blown dry really well."
2,A great piece of writing,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""River Town"". Completed it within 2 days. I'm typically someone who reads 3-4 books at any one time, and my fallout rate (ie. books I don't finish reading) is pretty high. But my attention was captured from beginning to end when reading Hessler's book. Well done, Ho Wei ! I've been to the main cities in China, but have relatively little exposure to the interior, especially the towns in the inner depths of the Yangtse. This book has inspired me to make a slow trip down the yangtse next year, and to see the Three Gorges before it disappears. I might just pop into Fuling !"
1,disgusting,This book advocates child abuse and should be pulled from Amazon immediately. It is not even worthy of one star.
2,Great CD,If your a Matt Dusk fan you won't be disappointed.If you don't know his music try it and you will become a fan.
2,Stirring and engaging,"This book is emotionally packed and made me weep buckets. In it, Naylor displayes her gift to write with a stirring, emotional power. Although I do like the Women better than the Men of Brewster Place - just because some of the men have a real hard time acting right - I'm glad that Naylor wrote this book so that the men could finally have their say. And what a say they have, and their words are important enough that I recommend that people looking to read a good story should listen."
1,cancer warning?!,"This saddle was not as soft as I thought it would be but it was still a bit better than the stock seat on my Fuji bike. Definitely harder than expected. The only thing that eats at me is the health warning on the back of the product packaging, stating in tiny print """"WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm."" I'm usually not a worry worm but I wish I knew about this warning before buying so I can make a better informed decision since there are so many other saddle choices out there. I'm surprised none of the reviews mentioned this. I guess either the warning is so small that no one noticed, or others have noticed but didn't care."
2,Marriage Counselor,I thoroughly enjoy Tyler Perry's Videos. A needed point is always addressed in his media.
1,Wrong item sent,"I ordered two boxes of Cranberry twist tea. The first box was fine, but we just opened the second box and found that it was cinnamon instead of cranberry. We cannot return it because we don't have any other to drink, and do not want to go without. I guess we just have to choke it down, but it is very disappointing to get the wrong thing."
2,Wonderful!,"This, like the other episodes of 'Allo, 'Allo, is excellent British comedy. Any fan of British comedy will love it."
2,Whoa.,"When I won this cd in February from the local radio station I listened to it, said to myself, that's ok. Somehow whenever I wanted to listen to a cd, that's what I listened to. On a long car trip I listened to the entire cd, and loved it! I'm listening to it again while I write this, the least I can do for to promote this great cd..."
2,Yogitoes,"I purchased this because I had issues with sweaty hands in Adho Muka Svanasana. It does prevent me from slipping, but I do prefer the feel of a yoga mat over the towel for my practice. Another problem is the fact that even with the silicone nubs on the back, the towel tend to shift around the mat, and needs to be readjusted several times during the practice. Overall, it was a good purchase."
2,Erase the damage,"At my young age, I managed to get, small spider veins. This product literally erases the damage... I also recently went to las vegas with my husband. While in the Rios casino buffet, I hit my leg, on a metal chair. This product has arnica in it. The arnica portion eliminated my bruised leg. Swanson vein essentials definitely has multiple uses."
2,One of the best books I ever read !!!!!!!,"Jeremy Leven makes you think about our being, makes you look at things in a different way.I deeply recommend this book to everyone who wants to find new ways of thinking."
1,i did not buy it,"I cancelled my order for this product, therefore, I do not have anything to review."
1,Didn't last 2 years,I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn't like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough. I've had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won't turn on anymore. I've had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/
1,Boring,"I keep HOPING with each book, Cornwell will regain some of the glory of the earlier stories. It obviously isn't happening with this installment. The book reads like a rushed first draft that was never seen by the editor. You don't care about the characters, the plot is contrived, and the suspense is nonexistant. As of this book I am officially giving up on Scarpetta and her adventures, which is such a same"
1,COM w/o ASP discussion! What's up with that?,"It astounds me that a 1500+ page book on Delphi 5 programming could present COM and not even mention its use in developing objects for use in Active Server Page development. I'd be willing to bet that 90% of all Delphi programmer questions about COM are motivated by an attempt to use Delphi for web development. And, under Windows - which is where Delphi plays today - that means ASP.It's like writing a treatise on the uses of rubber in commerce and industry, and not mentioning automobile tires.I think Oswald shot Kennedy - I'm no conspiracy buff - but it's more than a little puzzling that this book, along with the Harmon book (Delphi COM Programming) choose not to discuss ASP.What's up with that?"
2,"Incredible book, highly recommended for all men","I got a lot out of this book. It is very challenging to practice some of the things that David proposes, but definitely an enriching experience. This book is probably one that I will refer back to in the future.Highly recommended."
2,Finally...,"Yep, that'll do it! Seymour can be a bit tougher to follow than Clancy, Ludlum, etc...but man, is it worth it! Had been in a bit of a rut in finding an engaging read, but once I saw Seymour's latest(?), read the jacket, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. This guy is seriously under-rated."
2,Looked bigger in photo but works great,"Like everyone else said, size specifications would have been great. I'm gonna order an additional, bigger one.I'm using this for jewelry parts. It's too small for the bigger stuff and the really tiny stuff seems to 'leak' under the dividers into the next section unless you really cram the divider in there. But overall this is awesome, especially considering it's not made for jewelry!"
1,acurate and complete but it will seriousely put you to sleep,"I read part of chapter 1 and didnt read any more.. extremely dull. Good for reference,not for reading"
1,Sensationalistic banter,"I won't argue with the facts that Sean Hannity presents, but I disagree with his exaggerations and sensationalism when it comes to delivering his message. This guy just walks the extreme right tight rope and refuses to listen to the other side of anything."
1,bad,"nanci needs to get back to her roots. I would just like to hear some new work from the ""old"" nanci. This cd is terrible"
2,The Best!,"For being such a simple product (i.e. a mousepad), this is great. I bought two to place under my keyboard and mouse, and they are awesome. I am going to order two more to cover most of my desk and to put under my computer. I have not seen this size of mousepad in stores anywhere, only online. And the blue color is great, much better than boring black! If you want something to cover up a majority of your workspace then order several of these.Some people are commenting that this has a bad odor, but I really don't notice anything. It does smell a little ""rubbery"" when you open it, but it's barely noticeable and nothing that any other mousepad doesn't smell like. I can't recommend this enough!"
2,Great Replacement,"Has worked well for me for almost a year now. Doesn't get as hot as previous power supply (that actually self distructed). Nothing fancy, but does exactly what it is suppose to do."
1,a poor novel for all dedicated Rice fans,"I found this novel to be thoroughly disappointing. I loved The Vampire Lestat (it's among my favorites of the vampire chronicles) and I also particularly liked The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned. After such books as those, I was almost embarrassed for Rice's effort at this book, which was so obviously far removed from her normal standards. This book lacked excitement and pizazz. I will never read it again. I rate it down there with Memnoch the Devil, which was another poor and disappointing Anne Rice book. My advice to you is: check out another book of hers. Don't read this one."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"With an in-store and mail-in rebate I was able to purchase this burner for ($). What a mistake that turned out to be. It installed easily and performed well for about one week. After that the CD's I burned would either (1) not be recognized by any CD player or (2) sound very distorted and garbled when played. I tried IOmagics online support, phone support, and support forum. None of the suggested fixes worked. Want more horror stories - go to the IOmagic support forum and read the nightmares owners are having with this product. If you buy this item please call me - I have an old 8-track tape player I would like to sell you."
1,waste of money,"Bought this on a whim after I bought my Canon A75...looked like a good deal for the price. I'd have to agree with all the previous reviewers and say ""don't waste your time"". The bag is big enough for the camera and maybe a spare memory card, and it doesn't have any straps (just a belt loop). Save yourself a couple bucks and go to Walmart and get the Samsonite bag the previous reviewer mentioned (I got one for under 4 dollars with plenty of room for extra batteries, cards, etc.)"
2,These are the cutest shoes!,"The picture does not do this pair of shoes justice! The detailing is fabulous and they work well with skirts/dresses as well as pants. Very comfortable, too! Get out the sandpaper at first though, because these are really slippery until you get them scuffed on the bottom. I've had these shoes since December and can't say enough about them! I get compliments everytime I wear them."
2,Four year old loves this toy,My four year old loves this toy. He loves John Deere and has recently taken an intrest in fishing so this was perfect. This item was also received in a timely manner. overall great product
1,very disappointed,"I bought the dvd player to use on a long plane trip.I was inflight when I used the dvd player. I was very disappointed to find that the dvd did not load correctly. I got sound but no picture. I thought it was something that I was doing wrong. I attempted to access the dvd again when I arrived at my hotel room- to no avail. When I returned home, my husband was able to get it to work for awhile then he too was unable to get a picture. I returned it to the store within 30 days. Now I'm trying to find a light weight dvd player with at least a 10 inch screen and a decent battery- Wish me luck"
1,marketing channels,This book is hard to read. It lives me feeling like i'm going in circles. I may drop the class that uses this book. I'm having a hard time answering assignment questions and am very frustrated with this book. Please think before you assign this book for a class.
1,Who ever wrote this book...,"Who ever wrote this book must have the dumbest tattoos on their body. Like many others, I was drawn by the cover and interested to see what cool designs lay inside. There was no imagination in any of the drawings, and I guess that's the readers responsibility. But seriously, there are more interesting works on the internet to look at for free. Unlike the rest of everyone else on here, however, I got the book from the library so it cost me nothing. At least I wasn't stupid enough to buy it! Oh!"
2,Came quickly good price,"The book came quickly (3 days) and was in acceptable condition, slightly used as was stated. It was hardback and I hope to get many years of use out of it."
1,Terrible,"Terrible writing, grammar, plot...all around awful reading experience.Don't waste your time on this, I got it from the library and the person before me was correcting Berry's numerous grammatical errors with a pencil!Some of the plot devices were straight rip-offs from other novels...but that's fine, nothing is original any more. But the way he goes about using the plot devices is flat out laughable.Also this might be the most stupid main character I have ever had the displeasure of following. Lord is a ninny. The way he refuses to realize who can or cannot trust is baffling."
1,terrible,"This book is required for all the calculus classes at my university which is unfortunate, it has some challenging problems ill give it that, but the examples/explanations are TERRIBLE, it explains the easiest and most basic version of the material and then expects you to be able to figure out their extremely challenging problems, I don't even bother looking at the examples them anymore. Only buy this book if its required for your class, if you're trying to teach yourself calculus this is not the right book for you because you will learn nothing."
1,La Bella Figura means: shallow but pleasant,"La 'bella figura' is the concept of putting on a pleasing appearance, regardless of how shallow an affectation it may be.Unfortunately, this same idea of shallowness dressed up in a pretty package describes the entire book--which is charmingly written but comes across as a facile, patriotic celebration of bogus 'Italianness'. It upholds every stereotype of ""theme park Italia"" you've ever encountered. Italy has existed for less than 200 years, but the author seems barely aware of this fact. If Walt Disney produced a treatise on Italy--this would be it!"
2,all jesse stone videosand books by robert parker,robert parkers is one of the better mystery writers and the jesse stonenovels is no exception.the movies follow the books quite adequite.tom sellec is perfect match for the jesse stone character.I have the complete set of books so far and will obtain the subsiquent videos.
1,Too bad it doesn't work with Windows 7,"It started out GREAT, when I first installed it on my new HP laptop. As soon as windows started updating with all it's ""fixes""..that was the end of it. After that, every floppy disc was unable to be read from my computer. Message reads ""disc must be re-formatted, in order to be used"". Apparently same thing happened to someone else here, reviewing same TEAc product."
1,Dated and disappointing,"This book promises to teach you how to ""Globalize your business with digital and online technology"". Unfortunately the book was first published in 1998, so the information is at least four years old. Furthermore, the author is much too pedantic for my tastes. (He begins chapter 1 : ""In the eigth century B.C., when Homer wrote the The Odyssey ...).If you are interested in expanding to international markets via the Internet, this book is unlikely to help."
2,Solid collection -- with 1 all-time CLASSIC!,"This is as solid as NE Tiptree collection, but worth it all 4 ""A Momentary Taste of Being,"" 1 of THE most devastating SF stories U'll ever read. Impossible 2 Dscribe, it takes 70 pages, but U'll B knocked out. Should've won an award, Cms 2 B completely overlooked, even by Tiptree's fans -- would make a great movie: the enormity & the Dspair, as U discover what Man's Ultimate Goal really is. Vivid, riveting, totally involving. A tough read, but what an impact! ""Her Smoke Rose Up Forever"" is pretty powerful, 2. Tiptree's suicide was a big loss 2 the SF field. I also recommend her novel BRIGHTNESS FALLS FROM THE AIR, & many of the stories in her earlier collection, WARM WORLDS AND OTHERWISE."
2,Very pleased with my purchase and seller's response!,"This butter keeper fits perfectly in the margarine/butter shelf in the door to the refrigerator. The clear plastic keeps the margarine/butter within sight so I always know if I need to put another stick in. The seller responded almost immediately and it was actually delivered earlier than the estimated delivery date! All in all, I consider this a good purchase with excellent response time. Thank you."
1,Stopped working a week after the waranty expired,The CD player on this unit stopped working within a week of the warranty expiring.
1,Worst,"Worst product ever order over internet. Coffee maker was not new as advertised, would not work. terrible product that I received."
2,Defies Time,"'Knowing God' is a great resource for anyone is either beginning their walk with the Lord and desires to know Him more and desires to know more about God's attributes or someone who is aged and never studied theology. You don't need to be a theologian to understand this book. Although written in 1973, this work holds up incredibly well and stands the test of time. It is still culturally relevant, pointed and clear. Read 'Knowing God' and be in awe of the Lord."
1,Very Disappointed,I thought I was going to love this router and all my computers would share a faster single. Well it didn't work out like that I had to reinstall it 3 times on my main coputer and it still didn't work and to make matters worst after i added and rebooted the third time my hard drive crashed now I have to send off for a restore disc. My laptop can still get the signal but the router stops sending basically when it wants to so I lose my connection in the middle of work and can't get it back up for sometimes hours. My other belkin routers work like a dream and this is a nightmare. I've lost everything off my other comp and this one I'm afraid is not far behind. I don't know if I'll ever buy another belkin product.
1,"After replacing my Hoover for this today, I am returning this Bissel tomorrow.","Unfortunately, my Hoover died after 13 months and I replaced it with this today. The sample cleaner in the box had spilled out and that was my first negative when preparing to use this. It appears to clean the carpet well but for some reason about 4 minutes into the cleaning it makes this vibrating noise. If I press the nozzle to release the soap solution it will stop for awhile but will come back again. This may just happen to be a lemon and others may not do this.The tank in tank is not a good design. It is very difficult to clean even with the kitchen sink sprayer. I feel like it has to be filled with water more than other cleaners. You also have to empty the waste water more. The parts are all plastic and appear will be broken in the future.I gave this 2 stars because it does clean well but may not last long. Also, the scotch guard feature is a positive."
2,A good and almost complete book,"Well, I've read the 2nd Vol. of this book (the first is about basic Mathematical Methods in Physics). The vol. II contains a complete and well explained treatment of Group theory in Physics, a good and equally well explained review of Manifolds, tensor calculus on Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian Manifolds, Mathematical aspects of General Relativity.In brief: a good book on necessary maths for those who want to get a matemathical basis for QFT and GR. It contains a (first) good treatment of group theory (very useful for QM and QFT) and an original treatment of tensor analysis on manifolds based on a geodesic coordinates formulation (not the best for a first study but stimulating for those who already have a basic know-how of the subject) . A recommendable reference."
1,Warning: Do not buy Platano Records Edition,"The Platano Records edition (2005) of Piel Sin Alma is a Macrovision ""protected"" CD that will not play in a PC or a Mac/iPod, which is how I listen to music, or even some car stereos. Raulin Rodriguez is great, but be sure to get the EMI (not Platano Records) edition this CD. -- DJ Arnoldo"
2,A great read two-times!,"I suggest you read/listen to the book twice. First time to get the setting of the time and place. The second to enjoy the story. Dickens is such a good writer that an average person, like myself, cannot appreciate his ability to paint a story. He is an artist as well as a writer."
2,The Duchess of Duke Street Series 2,"This is the BEST. Great show, great acting. Worth every penny. Just wishthere were more in the series."
1,Save your money,"This gun has no problem shooting any kind of nails that we buy, and it has done about 200 square of shingles. The problem that I do have is that it will shoot nails crooked. While this may sound like the man running the gun having the problem, believe me when I say that the nail SIDEWAYS in the shingle is not a operator error. The gun is also super loud. I bought it after reading all of the great reviews that it got, but for all for nothing. The other gun that we use is an older Senco. It has put down countless squares of shingles and still operates great. It is smooth, fairly quiet, and best of all, drives the nails straight every single time. Don't waste your money like I did, spend a little more and get something that is a quality product."
1,Through the Madness!!!,"First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!"
2,Very Scary!,"This is a rather scary and faulty movie. Nothing in this is biblically correct, but it still manages to scare, regardless to how absurd the film is. Perfect to watch with The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. Watch it alone in the dark."
1,Ghostbusters III (be warned - SPOILERS AHEAD),"Here's a point by point analysis of Ivan Reitman's latest insult to the intelligence of movie-goers everywhere:GHOSTBUSTERS / EVOLUTION1. 3 white guys and 1 black guy / 3 men and 1 woman2. They are shunned by the scientific establishment / Same here3. Ghosts start popping up everywhere / Critters start popping up everywhere4.

1,This a Demo - not a real product,"I only gave this product a 1 because 0 was not an option.This is not a real product. This is a demo. This CD only contains 2 out of 8 English lessons. The rest are part of the ""advanced"" product. (More money please)The learning time module consists of learning ""o'clock"" only. No ""quarter past three"" or ""three thirty"". Just 3 o'clock.For other languages (Portuguese, Chinese etc.) it only contains the first Exercise in the first lesson. Just enough to learn to say boy, girl, cat, dog. I'm not kidding.I don't know how they get away with saying that this has been selected by the State Department. Certainly the State Department didn't select this demo. I find it hard to imagine that they would even select the full product from what I saw..."
1,Time passed this,"2 1/2A perfectly mediocre live capsule from this minor folk-proggie does capture a few instrumental moments of passion (the second half of Year of the Cat and some creative liberties with the following Pink Panther theme finally breathe much needed life into the disc), but the majority of singer-songwriter-slush feels autopiloted-bland at best, worse off for that pretentious late 70's British sort of lyrical and vocal delivery. I would say that if you enjoy newer Steely Dan, then rock out with this."
2,Great DVD,I have bought coaching products before but they have always cost me a fortune and I had to buy a whole set of DVDs.Glad to finally have everything on one disk. I especially like the tactics section as it was nice to see everything put into practice !Highly recommend modern tennis essential tools.
2,THE best mixer,the best mixer ever plan on buying another one soon it has so manny great things and sounds effects too
2,Love the china,"I've sently purchased 3 boxes of the Loft china. I love it, it's a good classic design. But beware that the bigger plates might not fit your dishwasher or your cubords. It didn't fit our normal cuboards in our case. Luckly we could free up some space in our corner cabinet. But when you're having a dinner for a few people I'm sure you'd prefer if they fit in the dishwasher. So measure first, and maybe consider buying the pieces separatly so that you can choose a smaller since on the dinner plates."
1,Does not fit all Ridgid Shop Vacs,I have a Ridgid 9 gallon shop vac and the filter was about an inch too long. I actually had to cut an inch off the bottom and drill a center hole in the bottom plate to re-mount it. I don't know the model off hand but it was purchased in 2008.
2,easy to read and follow; better for PROC SQL begginers,"If you are new to PROC SQL, this is the right book. It covers all the basic queries, complex queries in simple content, some troubleshooting, and a little bit of efficiency. The layout throughout the book is very easy to read and follow. All examples contain PROC SQL codes, results, appropriate explanation, as well as part of SAS LOG and comparison in some examples. This book might be a little basic to power PROC SQL users. But compared to SAS SQL procedure user's guide, it is way better to have."
2,FoodSaver,Great product and reasonably priced. Seals food great and is easy to use even for first timers.
1,It's Greek to Me,"I'd been wanting to see this movie because I haven't been able to find a review that tells what happened. Well, I've now seen the film, and I still don't know what happened. I'd never seen any of the actors before, so I didn't know who was playing whom. Now I see that Matthew McConaughey was Adam, but he told the FBI agent that it was his brother Adam who had killed all those people. I thought I understood what was going on during the boys' childhood, but during the grown-up scenes I became completely confused. My husband and I even watched the last part twice, but it didn't help. I guess I'll go to my grave without any answers regarding this film."
2,Cardbox box is toddler proof,"I love this movie and so does my 2 1/2 year old. But I want to review the box. Some reviewers hate the all cardboard packaging. I love it. My toddler loves to hold DVD boxes, she always accidentally breaks both plastic kinds. This one she walks on, pulls apart (when the disk is not in it) and it still holds and protects the disk. And she can get the disk out without abusing it. I hope this packaging becomes dominate while physical media still exist."
2,Saves You Time when well maintained,"This unit will vacuum a level of your home while you go out to run some errands, do laundry, play with the kids, etc. It vacuums to you don't have to. One can say that one would vacuum more often using this device than an active hand held device. I certainly do. I vacuum every day. Multiple times per day. Literally. This device enables you to do that.However, everything has a price. The price here is maintenance. However, you can do that maintenance at a time where you have time, and keep the unit running in peak performance.Buy a spare batteryiRobot Roomba APS 4905 Batteryand a fast chargerROOMBA P/N2004 Rapid Charger for Roomba and have continuous service after swapping the battery and emptying the dust bin!Buy One for sure!"
2,Cool Car for Lego Men,"What a cool transformer. This one was fairly easy to transform (following the instructions of course), except for the few times where parts fell off which were easy to re-attach. I so like it how a lego man is almost the perfect size to sit in the car. Now my lego man can cruise the carpet in style. Can't wait to get the other Alternators."
2,Years with this Product... still not disappointed,"I've been using the Nioxin system on and off since I was 16... when I began shedding hair at an alarming rate. Waking up and finding a pillow full of hair doesn't exactly feel right to a teenager. Luckily I heard about Nioxin and after 3 months of use my hair was back to its normal thickness. I continued use for a few years and then bounced back and forth between several products.It can be a bit expensive to continue the Nioxin system, and that is the ONLY reason I ever switched to other products. I found a cheaper solution in DS Laboratories Revita. It worked! For the first bottle anyway. I was on the second bottle of that stuff and I started to shed again in the shower. My hair thinned out so much on that particular product my family and friends noticed. I panicked and went BACK to Nioxin! My hair is finally coming back to normal, and I learned my lesson. From my experience, I can happily recommend Nioxin to other victims of premature hair loss."
1,"Beautiful, handy, but not durable!","I bought this grass trimmer by the end of last year to trim my small garden. After only 4 uses, the motor broke down! I took it to a Black & Decker authorized dealer in my country (I'm not in the US)and they told me the motor was broken and that there is no way to fix it. They offered me a new motor, but it was more expensive than a new trimmer so I just left it that way.Consider other options, this trimmer is not good."
2,For Kids - But Great for Adults,This book is written for kids - but the author has written it in a way that works for adults also. Good solid information that is communicated for all ages. Excellent for the person thinking about raising goats or the novice just beginning with goats.
1,Junk History/Science,"What a bunch of simplistic, wordy, and mindless gibberish. This kind of ""Junk History"" contributes nothing to the advancement of mankind's journey. It only serves to feed the simplistic and lazy mind to make overdrawn conclusions and in this case this tome tends to lean to the right on the political spectrum. Never has the nation and the world been in such dire need of rational and sound thinking to guide us through this difficult time.Yet, we are now turing(no pun intended) to this kind of junk thinking, simplistic answers from religious zealots and useless polemics from mindless politicians. If our species is to survive and our enlightened culture to progress, we must reject such simplistic models...the thinking minds among us must do the hard work necessary to discover rational solutions to our most perplexing problems. This book does not contribute to this endeavor."
1,world war stories,The book was easy reading and interesting. I thought the book is overpriced for a paperback and the size.We have heard good reviews about this author who writes of his true experience during World War II
2,An Excellent Read!,The Rebel follows Melinda Metz's wonderful ability to keep the reader hooked. One problem is solved and another begins for the teens.The Rebel is my personal favorite thus far in the series. The eerie presence of the collective consciousness and the struggle between environment versus biological ties were truly mastered.I would reccomend this series to anyone from 12-60. It definitely leaves you wanting more!
1,Really? What a Let-Down,"After all the hype and friends' recommendations, I figured I would adore this book - the dry sense of humor, self depreciating jokes and slightly off-color topics sounded right up my alley. What I ended up reading was a thinly-veiled diary of a self hating, chain smoking (current? previous?) alcoholic, filled with a lot of ""You Had To Be There"" stories.Notaro's most successful when reminiscing about her family, but even those you can't count on 100%. You can tell the effort was there when this was being written, the product just falls way short and reveals how hard she had to try to be funny. I'll stick with Sloane Crosley from here on out."
1,Easily the Worst Children's Book We Have Ever Read,"It isn't funny or entertaining in the least. Our daughter (almost 4) is good at getting the jokes that are aimed at her age, did not understand why this boy's mother had abandoned him. I had to explain what was happening. The mother depicted in the book represents a truly poor parent by dumping her son with some aunt in a department store basement while she spends an extraordinary amount of time shopping for luxury stuff for herself. When she comes back she admonishes him for going to slow because they have ""miles more shopping to due"". I guess you're supposed to say ""Yeah that's really funny, I'll have to try that some time"". This bozo need to stay away from writing children's books."
2,Anatomy Trains,An excellent read that discusses the functional relationships of muscles within the body. A must have for any student or practitioner of bodywork of any kind.
1,Should be a -5 rating,"I have wasted more than 200 hours with HP Technical Support--what a joke--and have gone through 2 ""refurbished"" replacements. I use XP Pro and this machine will not maintain a wireless connection. Paper jams. Will not print with a wired connection. I was promised another replacement that never arrived. When I called HP about this, HP said they had no record of their promise and that now my warranty had expired. HP has the worst tech support of any company in my experience. This product is a lemon. HP should have recalled it."
2,Caruso Model Steam Rollers,"My sister swears by these rollers since they are easy to use and give a good curl. When her rollers started to wear out, she couldn't find this product in any stores so I found them online and ordered for her. Excellent product and highly recommended by my sister."
2,BUY THIS BOOK! BUY THIS BOOK! BUY THIS BOOK! BUY THIS BOOK!,i really enjoyed this book & i think 2 really under-stand this book you have 2 fall of a horse...just like i did...i really under-stood this!!!
1,Far Far Overated,"I'll give this one 1 star-for the very good creature special efx only. But, that's the only thing that this sequal bettered than the original. One reviewer, at the time of the films release, noted that this is little more than ""Rambo in outer space"", and they are right. This is an ACTION movie-not a Horror-Sci-Fi movie. True fans of horror: the atmosphere, the tension, mood ect , will not think this is a classic. It was at this period that action movies really came to the forefront and this indeed does belong in that slot.Stick with the original. I also think the under-rated 3rd Alien is much better than this. Forget the ridiculous ""Resurection"", I never even got past the silly part in that one where the born-again Ripley prooves she's a basketball star.I will say this is better than ""Resurection""-but that's about the only thing it's better than."
1,One of the Top Ten Worst Movies of All Time,"I am still in shell-shock that people of quality such as Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo-doo, this thing is beyond horrid - there aren't enough words to convey how much this thing stunk! The movie starts out ok, steadily begins to make less & less sense, becomes just utterly non-sensical, and THEN takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy - and WAY over-the-top gore. NONE of it making any sense, mind you. NONE OF IT. Not the time structure of events, not the things taking place, and most assuredly not the moronic ending. I was quite angry that I'd spent $1.08 at my discount video to even rent it."
2,"DVD Review of ""The Odyssey""","I really only got this for The Odyssey as I remember it when it was on a TV miniseries in the '90's. Still as good today as it was back then. Although some of the special effects are dated the story is at the heart of making this DVD special. It does follow closely to the original story by Homer. Great cast and Armaund Assante is excptional in the lead role. My daughter is studying mythology in high school and thought this was a good opportunity to introduce this to her as I remember really enjoying it when it was first broadcast on TV. It did not disappoint.As a bonus we get to watch Gulliver's Travels with Ted Danson, which I understand, was one of the better renditions of the story. All in all very satisfied and the price was right. Glad I found it on DVD!Bob"
2,Clear Concise and Politically Nuetral,"Great first book for a lesson on educational reform in the U.S. The authors deliver the facts without bias and judgment. Although this book is 15 years old, its use and application to today's education reform discussion is essential. Very deserving of the award they received for the book."
1,A Field Guide to trees and shrubs: NE and North-central US (Peterson Filed Guides),This book would be a lot better if it had more pictures. It's hard to compare a real specimen to a written paragraph.
2,Johanna Lindsey is Back and Different,"I have been an avid fan of Ms. Lindsey for years. I have each and every one of her books and am always anxiously awaiting the next one. I had been very disappointed with her last few books and was not expecting much from this new one. Boy, was I wrong! I loved this book. The characters, particularly the secondary ones, were endearing, and the protagonists were lovely. I like this new and different perspective from Johanna Lindsey. The main characters did not tear each other apart with words, but fell in love talking! Though I would have liked to see more passion, I was not disappointed with the passion in the book and I found myself seduced by the growing love between Sabrina and Duncan. All in all, I'd say that this was Lindsey's best novel of her last 3. I reccommend it wholeheartedly!"
2,Catches all of my sons drool and keeps him dry,"This has been the only set of bibs that have successfully caught all of my sons drool, while keeping his shirt underneath dry. Its got an inner lining that does not easily allow his drool to soak through. A resounding success. Also large enough to keep up with his growth."
1,101 Things A College Girl Should Know,This is an absolute waste of money. This book should be priced at $1.00. This tiny book has little content and is a ripoff.
1,"Call it what you want, but this ain't Camelot!","This video ambigously portrays Merlin as cold on one hand, and compassionate on the other. He was neither. Often the mysterious recluse, he was motivated only by his own interests. Absent are the brute savagery and violent blood-letting commonplace during Merlin's time(5th century). The cost of historical and literary integrity results in a slick, commercialized rendition pandering to a more family-oriented audience. Many of the familiar mythologies are either stripped down or missing- The Knights of the Round Table, origins of Excalibur in detail, the purpose of the Quest for the Holy Grail, King Arthur, etc.,. What we end up with are snoozy speciel effects, corny dialog, and a `happily-ever-after' ending which the 3 to 10 year-old age group will find very apealing. If you're a true lover of Arthurian mythology you'll most likely look elsewhere for chivalrous inspiration because you won't find it here."
2,Your Labrador will love it.,Wonder full book. I had one years ago and lost it.It is the best traing book available.Thanks for getting it for me.
1,Excruciating Disappointment,"This could have been a wonderful movie. Avater The Last Airbender is a great show, and I am a huge fan. When this movie came out, all of my friends and I went out to see the midnight showing. It was a terrible disappointment. Honestly, everyone walking out of that theater was either too let down to say anything or cursing M. Night. Shymalan for ruining the movie that has been looked forward to for so long. Do not waste your money; this is a terrible movie and an insult to the real show."
2,Good enough,"No problems with the function of the unit. I like the 3 settings (low, med, high) and the auto setting. However, the high setting is ridiculously loud and I often turn it off for that reason. It cracks me up to notice when the air quality gets worse according to the unit: when I open the window, when the dishwasher is running, when I vacuum, when something is cooking in the oven.Unfortunately, the uv bulb doesn't last very long (see my review on that product)and the replacement filters are half the price of the unit.Otherwise, I have noticed less allergy symptoms since I've purchased the unit and it removes smoke and other unpleasant smells quickly."
1,"Not really ""revised and updated""","If you already own the original Scrapbook (which is great), don't bother buying this ""revised and updated"" version. The only ""revised and updated"" things in the book are a new cover and a new chapter added to the end of the book that summarizes her projects over the past few years. The first chapter of the book, which details her vital statistics, still states she is single...it has not been updated to reflect her marriage to James. Also, her discography in the book has not been updated to include her past several albums. This is just a few examples of pages in the book that have not been ""updated and revised""....there are many, many more. What a disappointed and waste of money."
1,Not a Null Modem Adapter,"Despite being sold, and labeled as, a null modem adapter, pins 2 and 3 are straight through. Unfortunately I wasted 45 minutes troubleshooting software and serial port settings before breaking out the multi-meter to verify pin wiring on this adapter.Look elsewhere (unless you need a simple DB-9 gender changer)."
2,Great deal,"I've been a subscriber before, but let it lapse -- the amazon promo for -$10 got me to renew for 2 more years"
2,Great memories,I was lucky enough to see this great play on broadway many years ago and owned the LP. Needed to upgrade my music collection to more modern times (AKA CD) The story is still so true in today's society so the music was still very enjoyable. We lost a great composer and singer with the passing of Anthony Newley.
2,wonderfully gory.,"I absolutely love this movie!2 weird sisters that get revenge on the schools popular girls!in then end it, gets a bit goofy but, still its great!The prequel is also great!!"
1,Riped in 2 setups,I put the tent up for the second time and the slots riped where the poles go in. So I would say this is a horrible tent.
1,A BIG Disappointment,"Is this a joke, why does Chris now sound like Big Bird. I love Saves the Day, and I heard that this CD was so aweful but I could not believe it, then I heard it and I actually laughed...this CD is a joke right, I am hoping STD will release a real album and tell us all April Fool even though it is not April. I am still a fan, but damm after hearing this stupid CD it is kind of hard to tell people that, if you are a true fan of the STD style, you will hate this CD, don't listen to these other idiots that rave about this CD, it is probably the first time they heard of STD, trust me!"
1,Stick with 2.4GHz,"I bought this VTech phone last week from a local retailer and ended up exchanging it for another a few days later because we couldn't get the handset to recognize the base, even after entering the base ID into the handset over a dozen times and unplugging everything and letting it sit overnight. The 2nd phone found the base perfectly. However, the reception was so poor that I'll be returning that one too. The sound cut in and out and I could barely leave the room where the base was - taking the phone outside wasn't even possible before it dropped the call.I really liked the design and the functionality of this VTech, but 5.8GHz or not, this is one phone to avoid. Our house is brick and we've had reception problems with cordless phones in the past, but we've never had any problems with Panasonic. Go with the Panasonic KX-TG2700S instead. It's only a 2.4GHz, but I'm getting perfect reception with the Panasonic AND can take it outdoors without any problems."
1,How long does it take for 1 item?,"My son wanted this DVD because he stated ""I have the Mickey's Twice about a Christmas, I am interested in knowing what happened in Once about a Christmas, mom can you order it for me""? I said why not I see it is pretty reasonable, so I did. I ordered on November 25, 2012 and I still have not received the DVD. Today is December 10, 2012. I am not happy with the performance of this company. I will seek another company and stray away from this one, a red flag has gone up."
1,WARNING TO CARING PARENTS AND OTHERS !,"Many people write as if this film was a classic. Even considering it is 27 years old, right from the beginning the film has some really nasty anti-gay comments and words that are said matter-of-factly by the heroes of the film. For those who have GLBT family and friends, this is very hurtful and we would not want our children to think this kind of hate talk is acceptable. There are also unpleasant references to women, to welfare recipients, and to Germans. Shame on the writer and director for having children say these thoughtless lines. Adult curse words are used by the children regularly and they smoke as if it was OK. In general, the screenplay is very weak while the acting and make-up are OK to good. Watch this at your own risk and remember that "" children will listen "" to what they hear. Be glad much of our society has moved beyond hate speech being tolerated, let alone encouraged."
2,EXCELLENT!,I think that this book was great - all three of them. It really shows kids fighting for their freedom and risking their lives for their friends.
2,At last somenthing that makes sense!,"With this new book the author has given to Isshinryu a new and more advance approach. The techniques in the book are not based on the traditional ""block, punch and kick"". Instead of describing the bunkai as ""everything is pressure points"", the author analyze the techniques from the perspective of locks, Chin Na, White Crane, Kuiai Jiao and others. The author also give another surprising theory about the Isshinryu patch, presenting proof of its origins. The book is a must for the advance Isshinryu martial art."
1,Annoying design,"I bought these to replace my iPod ear buds and was sorely disappointed in them. The sound is decent, but in order to actually hear your music without turning the volume way up, you need to actually press the earphones against your ear as it's impossible to get a snug fit. I'm also utterly confused by the need for the right headphone to be attached to the left headphone - it's just replacing a wire hanging in front of you with a wire hanging behind you. I'm taking these back today and looking for something else."
1,waste of money,"I would recommend that you stay away from this product. Don't even think about buying it. If you are sanding buy the 1"" adapter for your sander and look elseware for a vacuum hose. Poor design, low quality plastic materials make this product a complete waste of money. RUN AWAY!"
2,Great 80's Concept Album !,"It's moody, a little dark, like for driving down the highway at night . . . But that's why I loved it in the 1980's ! I just was never able to find the CD ! To me, it is the most well-done, well-produced album by Tommy Shaw, as I have heard most of his others to date . . . Still, yes, it has a certain heavy keyboard-80's sound, but it is more 'serious' than his other efforts in my humble opinion . . .So, dark, but GREAT guitar, it should have really been the concept for another Styx album, instead of the more light-wieght stuff they all have done . . ."
1,Didn't last long,"We simply loved this toaster for 13months which is how long it lasted. It was the most used appliance in the house. Toaster, oven, warmer, etc but one day it just stopped working (right after warranty lapsed, coincidence?) Too bad because I thought it was actually a very well designed, simple to use toaster oven. I'm tempted to buy another one because I liked it so much...but I simply can't bear to spend that much money for something that won't last me long. I think I'm going with the t-fal this time."
1,WOW!,"I can but echo Jerry Sapperstein's review. I, too, have read all of Griffin's book and have also reread a few. This one is obviously NOT Griffin. Griffin's economy of words goes a-begging in this one. Extremely disappointing. Don't bother with it."
1,A Great Idea but zero support,"A wonderful idea, and when it works it is really neat. But I had a heck of a time setting it up, had to throw out a perfectly good digital phone (it won't work with a digital phone anywhere in the house, Uiden and Vtech are hybrid digital, beware) and it took forever to get it to connect to the local phone line.Support is non-existent, I've sent three e-mails and never a response. Phone call (not an 800 number) take over a 1/2 hour to answer and you will be as knowledgeable as the tech support goof they connect you with. Frustrating.I love the idea, but they mislead you on the cost of the contract, which is way too expensive for the lousy service.It was a gift that has so far cost me $220 ($100 phone and $120 subscription service).Again, a great idea and a real pleasure while it works. But don't buy one for your parents or grandparents. When mine craps out that will be the end of it, I've never been this fed up with a company as I am with Ceiva."
1,"I'm in college, that means I'm smart and you should listen to what I say (I'm kidding, but seriously)","There are various reasons to listen to music. Some rap (such as Jurassic 5) can be appreciated for their fantastic lyricism. Others (such as Lloyd Banks) don't have much in the way of creative lyrics, but the impressive beats are a draw. I view rock music similarly. My point is, Seether really offers nothing to the game. ""Remedy"" is a solid song, it's really catchy. It's too bad that the rest of the CD isn't the same. Want proof? I own a hard copy of the CD. On the bottom of the back it notes ""Mixed by Randy Staub except Track 2 mixed by Rich Costey"". From this, one can deduce that the rest of the CD really is nothing like ""Remedy"". You'll never know when the song changes, it literally all sounds that similar. Do your sense of taste a favor and just download ""Remedy""."
1,2/3 good,About 2/3 of the movie was excellent but the last 1/3 had so much noise and static on the tape it was not viewable and hearable
1,bad just bad,"dont even waste your time, all the movie has to offer is in the trailer...just watch that, its actually better than the movie just because its only a minute and a half long."
2,Promising debut,"This the first studio album from lene marlin, it had a main single which was ""sitting down here"" and in the uk it done reasonably well. The album did recieve quite alot of good press but was never a big seller out of her own country of Norway.Most of this album has alot of gentle songs, guitar and soft beat driven. It has some more up-beat songs aswell, with some light electric guitar influence. Definately an album to invest in, may not grab you at first but is a definate grower, in my opinion the best albums are the ones you don't get too bored with easily after a few listens, and this is one of them."
1,Torture,"I have been attempting to read this book for two months. I refused to put it away without finishing it. But, the thought of reading it was torture. It is soooo slow paced and drawn out. I feel like the real story could have been told in half the time. Did I really need to hear about how she juggles her time in the car between time on the cell phone. How about her time at a diner while on the cell phone. I mean really? Why should my time be wasted on this?"
2,From Renaissance to Nutcracker is brilliant.,"The Los Angeles Guitar Quartet's Nutcracker Suite is a triumph for guitar arrangement. This selection is an excellent choice for one's holiday listening enjoyment. In the Renaissance dance suites included here, the L.A.G.Q. masterfully utilize a number of the percussive timbres available on the body of the classical guitar to complete the instrumentation and invoke the spirit of the pieces. Though the recording is not as loud as most of the other L.A.G.Q. recordings, the quality of the performances more than makes up for it."
2,Excellent made-for-TV WW2 true story,"This is the best made-for-tv movie (broadcast network) that depicts true events I have ever seen. Rutger Hauer and Alan Arkin are excellent as a Russian POW and a Jewish concentration camp prisoner who lead an uprising in a German concentration camp. It left me feeling ""at least SOMEONE in a concentration camp stuck it to the Nazis."" It also made me wish more had been able to. It's surprisingly graphic for a made-for-tv movie (I think it was on CBS); it shows naked women lined up to enter the showers (gas chambers). Just a word of warning to parents."
1,"Crystal Rainbow Castle short of ""Magical""","The castle is cheaply made and comes with so few accesories worthy of mention and without the types of accessories that would make it something fun to play with. My daughter has hardly even played with hers, with the exception of opening and closing the castle just to hear the sound! She also noticed on her own that the apecial ""wand"" used to open the castle was not like the one in the adverstisement....""Mommy, there's no crystal on my wand, look!"" Also, the dance floor so weak it's nearly impossible for my 5 year old to even manuever. A definite disappointment for the $$"
2,Persevere,"Michener makes you earn the rich rewards in this book. He makes you read the first 100-150 pages which are tedious & boring unless you are a geologist or paleontology freak. This is because the first 100-150 pages are set millions of years ago telling how the Rockies were formed & a boring story about diplodocus the dinosaur that has little to do with last 800 pages which are set in the last 500 years.Even though the start was a complete yawnfest I'm still giving this 5 stars as the rest of the book is as captivating & as compelling a book as I've ever read.Someone should have had the guts to order Michener to severely edit the start, as alot of people would not have the patience.I didn't know much about the real cowboys & indians but Michener paints a picture so vivid it's extraordinary.This is the first book I have read from Michener, it won't be the last."
2,I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD,"I bought this keyboard to replace the keyboard that came with my Dell Dimension 8200, on which the volume keys had ceased working. I usually purchase Logitech, but I picked the Microsoft because of the price and looks. The sales guy didn't seem all that impressed with it, but I didn't want the cheapest ($10-$12), but didn't really want to spend that much. I love the quiet touch of the keys and all the pre-programmed keys which seem to work so fast. Really enjoy the My Favorites 1-5 keys as well. I liked this KB so much I went and got another one for my Dimension 4700C, which came with a Dell KB that seemed small & awkward! The Microsoft KB is very comfortable to use and I'm really happy I picked this one. I'd recommend it to anyone, especially with the prices on some of the keyboards. Except in special circumstances (like the one I have attached to my big television), who really needs wireless keyboards anyway.I am totally pleased with the Microsoft Digital Media Pro Keyboard!"
1,Out of nowhere.,"I received this album in the mail two weeks ago and haven't been able to stop playing it. The funny thing is that I didn't even know what it was when I opened it, I thought I'd been sent a Rob Zombie album as a joke 'cause Damian is so white!But I started playing it and damn man this is Public Enemy from '88 to '91 music. You love the beats but you want to hear the words, it makes you think and gets you up.I'm going home now to hear it again."
1,Not as described,I ordered these insoles for my casual shoes. They are useless as they are very thick and my foot is almost sticking out of the shoe. I cannot use them and cannot return even as i have cut them to fit into my shoe. Waste of money
2,"Great quality (for me and my setup, at least)","Some people have had problems with these Sony DVD+r, I personally have had no problems whatsoever.I got these for $18 at costco, and I was a little apprehensive as I always order Verbatim from Amazon, with 100% perfect success rate. However, these Sony DVD+r have worked perfectly for me, 100% error-free burn rate in the 15 DVDs I have already recorded.So that you understand my setup: I have 2010 iMac (Mac OS 10.6.4, 4gb ram) that comes with the standard DVD-CD burner/Supedrive (HL-DT-ST DVDRW GA32N). I mostly record DVD-video media (.mov, mpeg2, .vob)."
1,Info based on stereotypical information - not research,"For example, William Sidis is described as 'burned out', or unbalanced. At the time of his death - his friends did not think that he was either. He wasn't. He rejected capitalism, for that he is remembered, even in new books - as unbalanced. This author did not do research."
1,"Leaky, cheap and poorly thought out","If left full water leaks out of seams on the bottom and pools around the base. Fill indicator is located behind handle and difficult to see, especially when holding the handle (when filling it, for instance). Markings on fill indicator have worn off less than one year after purchase (again, indicator is behind handle). I HIGHLY recommend buying a more expensive but higher quality unit."
1,"Awful, flimsy, bad product",Really hoped this would do the trick to block air under the doors. You have to cut it shorter than the door for it to close and it falls off when you open the door. Would NOT recommend to anyone
1,horrible toy (...),"(...)kids want it, but is frustrating to build and impossible to build unless you are 21. save your money and your hair."
1,Not really supprising considering the source,"Cornelius Rumstuckle aka J. H. (Herbie) Brennan. co writer of the such gaming books as Sagas of the Demonspawn Aztec Quest, Egyptian Quest, Greek Quest, Roman Quest and Grailquest, amoungst others. So it is no supprise that his current book has such game book as part II, He has written some on occult topics such as An occult history of the world and Magick for Beginners: The Power to Change Your World. But then is anyone realy supprised that such a book is coming from Llewellyn. He has three books currently in print with Llewellyn, they are Magick for Beginners: The Power to Change Your World, Magical I Ching, Time Travel: A New Perspective."
1,iPod showed up inoperable.,"This is a wonderful product, however I bought it refurbished from the vender, and it showed up incapable of communicating with my mac. I am currently working on the problem, but it appears somewhat grave because I've been through all the general troubleshooting on the Apple website, to no avail. The bottom line is that a I received a busted version of a great product from a second-hand dealer."
1,"For A Younger, Less Experienced Audience","I bought this book hoping to get detailed, in depth information about many of the more famous serial killers as well as information on the different types of killer's profiles. I bought the wrong book. After reading this book cover to cover, however, I can say I was entertained and did learn some interesting facts.The book never really gets that in-depth in to WHY these people comit the crimes they comitted. It is also a little too light-hearted in places in dealing with a distasteful topic. I would have preferred a much more respectful approach to the topic.This book IS entertaining as a light read on an airplane or something like that, but there are other books on this subject that would be vastly more interesting to the discerning reader looking to learn something about serial killers."
1,confusing internet setup,"i wanted a camera that could email photos but this camera will not go out through the router and the manual setup , to punch a hole thru router is confusing."
2,Love this headset!,"I've been using this headset at work for the last year and a half and absolutely love it! The sound quality is supurb, the weight is light, and the range is decent (up to 100 feet or so with thin office walls and cubicles in between).I just ordered another for my wife (who works from home) who will need to answer the phone from throughout the house once our first baby arrives. She's already tested it in every room of the house (2-story), and the back yard as well without the slightest loss of signal (base unit in loft in middle of house).I believe the sticker price for this was far more than I expected, but thanks to Amazon I was able to spend $150 less than my work did for mine!Excellent...."
1,Unsatisfactory,Had great hopes to use this photographing my jewelry. The box itself is fine. The lights are insufficient and the tripod uneven.
2,"Cutting Edge Thriller. Smart, Fast Read.","Whew! I sat up all night with this one. Besides a plot that doesn't let up, this spooky, vivid tome is filled with very readable science. This CAN happen! Darnton is a terrifingly great writer. Eat your heart out Thomas Harris!"
2,"Great Deal, Finally","Finally, I can have both copies under one packaging. Now I am able to allow the kids to watch the movie at home on the blu-ray player and also when they're strapped in their seats in the mini-van when we go for longer excursions. And considering that Disney standardizes all their prices, this is a great price deal. Paying $20 for each disc seemed a bit of a rip off considering I'm buying the same movie twice."
1,Very disappointed,"I like only one or two tracks on this CD. I had listened to samples of selected tracks before I purchased so I was surprised by my own reaction when I received the CD and started listening to it in its entirety. I don't think I have experienced this before but the more I listen to this CD, the less I like it. Some of the vocalists wander -- smearing notes instead of hitting them clearly. Some are annoying to the ear, while others are just plain boring. I think I'd have liked it better if they'd skipped the vocals entirely."
1,Not much of a mystery,"After I read Alexander Mccall Smith's very funny Op-Ed piece ""The Really Terrible Orchestra"" in the NY Times, I decided to try one of his books. In the Company of Cheerful Ladies (No.1 Ladies Detective Agency) was a real bore. No actual story line and certainly no mystery. I will pass on the rest of his books. MER"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,this sequel is very bad! it has a totally ridiculous plot and it was so boring i just turned the tv off 15 minutes into the movie.
2,We Got A Hit!,"I am so happy to have this wonderful piece of new Who music. It's creative, powerful, inspiring... all those things we tend to take for granted from Pete. The more times one listens to this 11:00 minute masterpiece, the more the inspiration, the melody, the sheer brilliance shines through. I can't wait for the album, and seeing them in person in NY and again in San Jose."
2,Vanessa Scores Again,"Why she isn't a huge star baffles me. I can play Vanessa CDs all day some days and just levitate in the coolest, happiest, love-filled space. This CD has a cut or two that are below her usual brilliance, but overall its a smash. Husband Peter - keyboard wizard - and Vanessa continue to meld retro styles with millenial chic ambient downtempo techo chill in a unique and pelvis-grooving manner. Vanessa continues to write about love in all of its carnaland transcendent facets.It's a logical step from Plutonium Glow, Slow to Burn, and Zipless (how is it that Slow to Burn remains out of print??). I can't wait to hear her latest.We love ya, goddess."
1,cheated,"I ordered 1-black & 1-tan envelope, I got the black one ten days later with 2 day air. The tan never arrived,so I emailed 4 times no response , that was 2 months ago on 1/16/2009 the order was paid. the envelope was nice but I at least expect a refund or the product or notice of back order. The product is still being offered by seattle gift shop as available."
2,Funny,"Funny and practical sayings inside, however the enunciation cues are not as helpful as I need for such a guttural language."
2,Haven't the slightest clue about the show.,I didn't know this was a part of a show at all. I was itching for new music when I found this and thought it seemed interesting after a couple intros.Awesome. I was so happy I purchased this. The variety of music is nice.
2,Excellent!,Great flavor and texture. Can be frozen after baked. Good price. Very happy with the product. Family agrees:-) Worth a try!
2,Beyond your expectation for sure,"I am a very picky person and I have researched for all the 7+ mega pixiel cameras and finally decided on SD500. I found this camera can perform beyond my need. It has so many functions that I doubt I will use them all. But ONE thing I love the most is the ""Photo-Stitch"" option that allow you to take a panormaic scene. When I loaded the series of pics on my computer, the software easily (and within a nano second) stitch up the pictures into one perfect, flawless panoramic scene. It will be good for travel and special event.A few complaints I have are: it is complicated to get to certain functin because Auto-mode allow you to do certain thing while manual and scenic mode allow you to do abit more. It is difficult to remember all that while you need to shoot in a hurry. Also, in the video-mode, there is some hiss-noise which quite bothering.Other than that, I give a 4 stars rating for this little devil!"
2,"saw it in the book store, planning to buy online.","It has a hard cardboard cover with plastic slots on the inside to hold the quarters. Between the covers is about 50 or so pages, with a small page about each state in the order of their entry to the union. There is some basic statistical information about each state. It's a pretty good deal if you are looking for a simple place to keep your quarters. But if you want a display, it's not of high enough quality."
2,GREAT SPEAKERS,Bought these speakers for my out door pool deck . and was concerned the sound would not be great. Hook them up and they sound awsome . great bass and highs . could not be any happy with them . did a lot of research and trust me for the price they can not be beat . 5 stars
1,Does not work,"Bought this product for my daughter. The first two times I used it, it worked OK. The third time, it filled with water. Followed directions explicitly."
1,Damaged,"3 times I returned this product and each time they sent a replacement it was damaged. The spine was pulling away from the binding. It makes me wonder if Amazon offers such low prices on books because they are ""seconds."""
1,new version *fail*,"The original product lasted at least 6 years.September 2011 bought new one from Amazon....seems motor or button faulty.CALL TRUDEAU 800#!!Trudeau sent replacement in March.Now it's April 2012.Again poor motor or button..Called Trudeau 800#!!They are sending a different pepper millSo.good customer service, something sub standard about new version of what used to be a good product."
1,not too tasty,"I bought this tea because my job was stressing me out and causing a lot of anxiety, indigestion, etc. and I use and love the other flavors of Yogi tea. Unfortunately, I can't handle the taste of this one. It's just too strong - almost burns your tongue because it is so spicy. I normally like ginger but this is too much."
1,Waste of Money--Broken after 2 days of light usage.,This ugly blue polyester covered heat pad broke less than 48 hours after I bought it. I used it three times within my house. Nothing crazy. When it worked it was nice but what's the point? I think I'm going to try a different manufacturer.
1,Spreading medical disinformation,"I am a physician/pathologist with a special interest in these tumors.The book contains a poorly written four page review of the literature on these tumors.The rest of the book contains general information for cancer patients on a variety of topics. This information is not useful for women with this particular tumor. The authors do not mention the virtually 100% survival rate for this ""cancer."" Most of these patients do not have ""cancer,"" and this book is dangerous because it will support the misconception that they do."
1,Just Average,"Not sure why this was a bestseller. Found it flat, predictable and just plain not interesting."
1,Misleading Packaging,The packaging for this car adapter says that it will convert 5 volts. It doesen't. There is no 5 volt adapter included.
1,Flimsy earings.,"I just received those earrings and was very disappointed. They're a lot lighter than I thought, the clasp doesn't close very well and the frame is very thin.I will probably be returning these!"
1,"Kenny G ""Faith""","I enjoyed Kenny's first holiday release ""Miracles"". So much so that I couldn't wait to listen to ""Faith."" However, I was extremely disappointed. The music is just O.K. It lacks the moving Kenny G style of his first holiday release. I hated the Auld Lang Syne millenial mix. I found it extremely distracting. Not something I would enjoy as background music while entertaining guests for the holidays."
1,THEY COULD BE ALOT BETTER!,"Read the reviews. seemed OK. got a pair. decent sound. I'm not a big sound-a-phile so I was pleased with the sound reproduction - forsitting on the bus or darting around town - they are/were just fine.the biggest disappointment is the cheap rubber sleeves that cover theearbuds (that are placed in your ear). THEY FALL OFF & YOU LOSE THEM!!the package does come with a replacement pair,BUT THOSE FALL OFF AS WELL!!and once you deplete the originals AND the replacements(which doesn't take long) YOU'RE SCREWED!!THIS IS A HUGE DESIGN FLAW! save your $20.00 & use it to buya better designed product.even though the price was right, i would not recommend these.unless you like sticking a hard piece of plastic into your ear canal!"
1,terrible phone!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the battery on this phone is terrible...evewryday i'm charging it, and the reception is very poor.....i miss my nokia"
1,Cost me 20hrs of time to recover from,"Added more memory to my Athlon XP 2800+. Thought it was a good price - system crashed randomly all the time. Eventually dug out memory testing tools, and the thing was trash.Took it back and got the PNY product, works like a charm. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,Great Watch if it works,"I bought this watch in 2010 and it worked for a good solid 8 months. After 8 months, the second hand would go to 12:00 and then fall down to 6. Then the battery died and after replacing the battery, the watch will not function. It worked great and was a fanatastic field watch...when it worked. Sadly, I will not pay to have it repaired as the repairs will cost more than the watch. Buy with caution."
1,amusing but unnecessary,"the content of this book was very different than what i expected. i was expecting a book full of ideas for the WEEKLY ""artist's date,"" but what i got was a DAILY cartoon book, offering SOME artist's date ideas, but mostly just cute (albeit inspiring) cartoons that don't pertain to the concept of the artist's date. the fact that it was a ""daily"" book, instead of weekly, is inconsistent with the author's suggestion for the artist's date. upon first glance, i found it both confusing and disappointing. not worth the price."
1,Ho hum,"This book was basically mildly mediocre. Maybe it's because I already know something about the antitrust laws, but I didn't feel that this book actually told me anything new. I feel that perhaps in their effort to make the antitrust laws ""readable"" by a layman they have made the material useless. You could probably find just as useful an introduction to antitrust laws online someplace for free."
1,"Nice try, BORING","Great attempt at trying tackle a sensitive topic, however it failed miserably. For an hour and half long movie, it drained the life out of me. I do appreciate a good cerebral thriller, this is not it. I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews, because the best acting performance was a toss up between the baby and dog.You can't rent this movie, so don't bother buying it. I would sell my digital copy to you if I could."
1,Terrible make-up,"I am sorry but the monsters do not scary, they just look like B-Monsters from a B-Movie."
2,For the Savvy Investor,"Fascinating insights. Gives you a more thorough understanding of savvy investing, which is all about reading the market and becoming aware of smart opportunities. Well written and well done!Dr. Henry ToofCambridge, MA"
1,"Badly designed, much too small, VERY messy and unwieldy.","This litter box sucks. I had to throw it in the dumpster after using it for ONE DAY. It's too small, even as a secondary litter box my big female cat made a huge mess of herself trying to use it, the top kept coming off (it is not attached at all!), it doesn't keep odor away even with the filter, the ""ramp"" is a total gimmick, litter consistently goes in the cracks of the device, the stairs, EVERYWHERE really. This thing is a total piece of garbage. TOTAL, UTTER, COMPLETE GARBAGE."
1,This book is full of incorrect information,"Somehow I have the feeling that author tries too hard to find ''average'' or ''transatlantic'' Portuguese usage in which differences between Continental and SouthernAmerican usage are minimized...But, by doing so, you get a distorted idea of both Continental and Brazilian Portuguese.The only chapter worth reading is the one on Brazilian diglossia."
1,Boring,"I love running and I was looking for something new to read about running. This books just wasn't for me. I read about half of it. The author's story is pretty interesting and if the book was just that, I probably would have finished it. The book is more about animals, their aerobic capabilities and their evolution. Too much animal kingdom science for me."
2,Great beginner toy,"My son got this as a gift when he was 6 months old, he is now 10 months old and it continues to be one of his favorites. He is still fascinated with the different instrument sounds and loves pushing on the keys."
1,"Boring, unlistenable","I love Metheny, but, if you have nothing to say, don't make an album. I can't even listen to it, it is so trite. I don't think I heard one melody. The CD sounds like a collection of the middle or endings of their older, inferior songs. And we used to get some time before the guitar synth was introduced, now it hits you in the first song. I would challenge Pat to put this collection into a songbook, I'd like to see the lead sheets-no melody, just chords. And to add insult to injury, I played Letter From Home this weekend. How far the fall!"
1,Never ending effects.,"This story has some events that could be proven creditable. Most, maybe even the entire book is based on all the effects that it takes away a good true story if that what it be down underneath."
1,An Unnatural History,"Professor Rybczynski's work demonstrates the power of the good vocabulary and writing skills that come with an education. He has managed by providing the reader with the history of the project, the tools in his tool box, the discussions with his wife that led to the identification of the screw driver as the subject of the book, to overcome the lacunae between a pamphlet and a 176 page book. This is unfortunate. The book contains just enough of the chronology and individual lives involved in the development of the screw and the tools required to turn it, to provide a real technical historian a terminus a qou from which to produce a fascinating book. This one however should have remained a pamphlet."
1,Really???,"This video looks as thought it was shot in the 1980-90s (based on the other vehicles). The speed seems to be a bit fast, and the movement of the camera makes me feel sick. Why does it often turn to the outside of a turn, rather than the inside (where we normally look when steering through a turn)? A lot of the footage is beautiful, but it certainly doesn't make me feel as if I'm riding or running. The music also sounds as if it's from decades ago.I wouldn't recommend this unless there's no other options."
1,I've read them all -- though I should've skipped this one,"I have savoured every ""Prey"" book and look forward with great anticipation whenever a new one is released. However, I was disappointed with ""Easy Prey"" and felt that Mr. Sanford took the easy way out. It seems that at some point he must have realized that the story was coming to an end and that he had no good suspect, so he had better make one materialize. I am glad to say that this is the only ""Prey"" book that I would give 2 stars, just about all the others warrant 5 stars. I suggest you skip right to ""Chosen Prey"", it continues where ""Certain Prey"" left off."
2,Good enough to read the rest of the series,"I enjoy historical fiction and this type of book raises one's level of awareness to the different perspectives of racism. another very good book is Candle in the Darkness by Lynn Austin, could not put that one down."
2,Fun and a good easy summer read...,"As a rule I avoid books by celebrities simply because 99% of them are self absorbed know it alls who are so far removed from us commoners that they don't see how superficial and stupid they sound. This book is one of the rare exceptions simply because its more fun and admits this from the get go. And it's a good, easy summer read."
1,WOW. Spielberg made this garbage?,"Worst Indy movie by far, If you haven't seen this movie keep in mind that the movie starts when Indy gets blown up by a nuclear bomb and fly's for miles in an old refrigerator. And then it gets worse. Aliens, Mind Control, Swinging like Tarzan through the jungle, man eating ants, dimensional portals? 3 waterfalls and a cliff? Also, since when is Indy a war veteran who also works for the CIA? I always thought he was a archaeology professor. I bet you that Spielberg wanted to make sure that no one would every harass him again about making another Indy movie. I bet he succeeded."
1,Oh fer pity sake.,"I ordered the vanity on Feb 19. It arrived in a timely manner. I had to laugh reading the other reviews because it did seem to take 1/2 hour just to get into the package. Once I got into the thing, I found it was missing a leg for the vanity entirely, and a couple of others we unusable on both the vanity and stool that came with it. They did replace the parts, but it took forever, and they sent damaged replacements. Finally resolved on Apr 11. It took 62 emails back and forth. I gave 1 point for what is a really cute piece of furniture and 1 point for a really good customer service rep. Otherwise, it was a complete nightmare. I'm pretty sure they shipped me somebody else's return. I was leery about ordering furniture online, and don't think I would do it again. This was an utterly exasperating experience. They refunded me a 10% discount, but you know...."
1,ERRORS ERRORS ERRORS,This book is FULL of errors!Ask your professor for the ACS exams - or to take them at least to get a feel for the types of questions you will get asked.
1,"No ""Certificate of Authenticity""","Received my order, started loading software, then prompted for a key code. Clicked the help to determine location of key code. Discovered that the ""certificate of Authenticity"" had been removed from the box. This leaves me with nothing more than a ""Trial Version"" at this point.I have contacted Amazon for a possible remedy.Haven't even had a chance to check the software out yet.......so no comment on that aspect.Received an e-mail from Amazon.....new product is being shipped! Two thumbs for Amazon on this one."
1,BEWARE: Three movies with same and similar title,"This one was produced in 1998 and stars Jeff Rector. Basically an FBI agent finds that vampires are killing people--then add gore and juvenile acting.NIGHTFALL (1988) was based on Isaac Asimov's book and stars David Birney, Sarah Douglas, Alexis Kanner--good sci fi. ISAAC ASIMOV'S NIGHTFALL ( 2000 starring David Carradine) is recent version, better version of same novel adaptation. In my opinion, LOOK for either one of those, not this dud."
2,"Conker is good, but there are some flaws...","Let's start out by saying this game should be rated ""I"" for immature, not ""M"" for mature. It's rude, it's crude, and it's pretty much all toilet humor. Outside of all that, it's a great game though. The graphics are amazing; there were points were it looked like a Dreamcast game! And the sound is equally good. The voice-overs are spot on and the characters actually move their mouths in sync with the words!(A first for N64 games I believe)The only problem lies in the control and camera angle. You will swear more that Conker does, I guarantee, due to the fact that he moves more at the speed of a water buffalo than a squirrel. This makes the game INSANELY DIFFICULT at times. But all inall, you'll forget about it after awhile and just enjoy the game. (Especially the Gregg Grim Reaper parts! They're the funniest thing I've ever seen in a game!) Buy it now, if you don't mind a few flaws in your gems."
1,Disappointment Guaranteed,Radiohead without the emotion. Oasis without the tunes. Mark Knopfler without the lyrics.
2,"good product, nice minimal packaging","The phone works great. I'm excited that it uses standard rechargeable AAA batteries. Those will be much easier to maintain. I like being able to listen to the answering machine from the handset. The calls are very clear all over and outside the house.As a plus, panasonic ships these in very compact packaging - well protected during shipment, but much less material to dispose of after opening than typical electronics."
1,Long winded and disappointing,I have been an avid Irving fan since I was in Jr High. I anticipate all his new arrivals with tingles. I am sure that I will laugh and cry. This time I did. Part 1 was great. I was curious about Part 2. It was all I could to finish it. Why? It totally faltered and was dull and predictable. I am afraid the creator of my all time favorite character has let me down. Next time I buy paperback and read the reviews.
2,Amazing,"Great product, smells a little like for older ppl. Either way i like the smell. Sometimes, i prefer juicy couture viva la juicy"
2,Buy it! Now!!,"If you like Fluke and The Prodigy, The Propellerheads and The chemical brothers: Go ahead! Buy this CD, you won't be deceived. It's the best of electronic music I've ever heard. You'll love it."
1,"The DVD is a Copy, not an Original","I received the movie in a very timely manner, but it is a copy and not an original. The print quality of the paper in the case is poor and even cut off. The DVD has a copy of a label too and is creased and trashed. The movie plays. I just feel ripped off."
2,I re-read this book every 5 years,"Whenever I re-read it, which I love because of its pathos if nothing else, I get a new gem of insight. Leon Uris is a masterful writer of historical novels. This book led me to other Uris writings and I have enjoyed them all. But, don't read this or any Uris if you want a happy ending. Realism is his game, and most of the endings - including the one in Trinity - are heartbreaking.The first time I read Trinity, I was still in college and preparing for a semester abroad. In later re-readings, I finally noticed Uris' uber-masculine lead characters, and the fact that most of the women were given little to do but look good and stand by their men. The feminist in me rebels at this kind of writing now, but Uris' books are so good I can overcome it. Also, Uris' books are mostly set in times when women's roles were more limited. So, I guess I forgive him - and will keep reading."
2,A Celebration of Tulips but no planting advice......,"While I purchased this book thinking it would help me learn about planting tulip bulbs, I didn't find any planting information. What I did find was still equally enjoyable. I learned that my favorite flower once grew wild in central Asia. I also found a creative idea for a ""Tulip Ice Bowl."" There is a short history of tulips and Chris Mead's photography captures the free, optomistic and swaying in the breeze life of the tulip.If you are looking for a house warming gift, this would be so well received with a bunch of fresh tulips. When I look at this book, it reminds me of visiting LaConner, Washington for the Tulip Festival.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Packaging,"The Po-Ke-No box had mildew on the inside of the box. Not very happy about that. I would have returned the game, but I was playing with a group of ladies a few days later, so there was not anytime to return the game to the seller. I will be more careful who I order from next time. Re-ordered this same game from another seller."
1,Completely disappointed,"This CD-ROM collection is not what I expected it to be. I can't believe National Geographic is even releasing this... And considering today's level of 'digitizing' methods, this collection is very poor. The text is hardly 'readable', and viewing is unacceptable. I wrote to the software manufacturer (I believe its a third party) and not one reply. So I'm completely disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one. The map collection is a 'relief' though in comparison."
2,Awesome,This is the best album that I have heard so far. Kelly Clarkson really knows what people want to hear. I recommend this album to everyone even if you really don't listen to music very much. She really proved that she is the original American Idol with this album.
2,"truely magnificent, beautifully crafted","I was truely amazed at the quality of the workmanship, I have seen many in the stores and was depressed.... but I look for quality and detail to things and was never impressed until now...... this armoire is exquisite!!!!! my beloved grandmother would improve infact it reminds me of her bedroom outfit..... thank you ever so much I will cheerish it always...... truely a magmificent armoire that i'd be proud to hand down after i'm gone......"
1,Intelligence insulting,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. It's a terrible shame because I love Dan Akroyd! It just wasn't funny at all. At some points I was bored to the point of wanting to go to sleep. Chase and Akroyd's characters never reached the potential they seemed to have at the beginning of the film, and the attempts at humor were ridiculous (in a bad way). I'm not sure how this has 4 stars here on amazon. I generally love comedies and am rarely ever disappointed with a movie, but that's exactly what happened with this one. Surely pass this one up."
2,good product,"I bought this to go with the Larenim powdered eyeliner I recently purchased. Works as advertised, seems like a solid, lasting brush."
2,I LOVE this product!,"I LOVE this steamer!! I use it for almost every meal. It is easy to use and easy to clean. (I had wash everything!) My favorite thing to make is sweet potatoes! They come out perfect every time and the skin just falls off.I haven't tried any meats yet! I am waiting on a steamer cookbook to come in with some recipes.I think that this steamer is discontinued. This is unfortunate because this is an nice large oval shape which is wonderful for asparagus and longer potatoes and large batches of cabbage, or veggies. I LOVE the double decker feature.Valerie in Texas"
2,Finding Humor in Pregnancy Pain,"I read this book twice and both times I laughed out loud! It is not meant to be informative, but rather funny. I did learn a lot, but it was the ""real"" stuff about pregnancy that you don't read in medical books. I HIGHLY recommend this book for all pregnant mothers looking for a good laugh and some girlfriend truths."
1,Seems to have a File Size Limitation,I had mixed results using the PNY Attache 8Gb. Works great as long as files are less than about 100Mb. Large files greater than 100Mb become corrupted for some unknown reason. PNY tech support is not very helpful and down right unbusiness-like as they refuse to answer my emails regarding this apprarent limitation.
2,James Taylor Christmas CD - a satisfied customer,I received my Christmas CD in time to enjoy the holidays and in perfect condition. Thank you for excellent service!
1,"Throw you obsolete junk away, don't sell it","This piece of junk is for iPods sold SEVERAL years ago and doesn't work with any 30 pin or shuffle iPods. When your stuff is obsolete, do the world a favor and toss it!"
2,Familiar...The Original and Still The BEST!,"I loved this book. Familiar is the smartest cat detective on the scene and I always enjoy reading about his adventures. This book was thoroughly inventive and original. For the record, the original Fear Familiar book came out in March of 1990, BEFORE Sneaky Pie Brown and Midnight Louie arrived on the scene. I think only Lillian Jackson Braun's cats beat him on the scene, and hers don't get into the cat's head the way the Familiar books do. Familiar was a groundbreaker, especially in romance, and this book is a good example why. Compelling characters and loads of humor and suspense. I feel this series is far superior to the others, proving that the original version is usually the best. People accusing authors of ripping off other authors should know what they're talking about before doing so."
1,Disappointment,"This book was such a disappointment. It was too short, the plot was incredibly transparent, and the romance was clumsy. And at the end, frankly, I think Tony Hillerman just lost a large portion of his female fans."
1,Not worth the money,"First let me say the seller was fast and I have no complaint about the seller. However the product is all but worthless.I purchesed there bits to drill some holes in 12x12 cermic tile to install a grab bar. We used a continues spray of water to help keep the bit cool, however the bit was dull before we finished drilling the first hole. The diamonds should have been impregnated into the metal and ran though the entire metal of the bit. It appears that the diamonds on this bit are attached with epoxy and wore off quickly."
2,"like my ""kitchen machine""","Feel this machine does a great job overall, but must confess that I just use one of the attachements, the chopping blade. I did try a few of the other attachments when I first got it, but wasn't thrilled with the performance of the other attachments, such as the one that slices thin slices. I also tried the juicing attachment when I first got it, but decided that it was more trouble than it was worth to use it. It has been a long time since I tried any of the other attachments, but if you just mainly want a blade for chopping up stuff, it works great. Very powerful and does a quick job of chopping up everything that I put in there. I have used it for cabbage, carrots, garlic, onions, nuts (made nut butters with it using raw nuts), sweet potatoes, frozen broccoli, and other fruits and veggies. No complaints, would buy it again."
1,NOT as good as the original,"I've had a few of the old style orbit track ball, and I loved them. so whenI bought a new computer I figured I would upgrade from my old Orbit.Ordering and deliver from Amazon are always great, but this productis second rate. The body feels flimsy and the one deal breaker is thatthe track ball itself does not stay in the body of the device, it just sitsin a slight depression and falls out with ease.The old Orbit had the ball snap into the body of the device and workedflawlessly, why make such a stupid change??I'm sending this back without ever plugging it into my new MacBook Pro."
2,Extremely fresh,"These candies are delicious. The shipment arrived within 2 days of the order date (thanks to prime) and were extremely fresh! They did not have the consistency I was expecting, but they're great nonetheless. I guess I was expecting them to be a little more ""tough"", but that can be easily achieved after opening the bag and letting them.. stale up a bit.. But either way I was very impressed with the freshness and taste of these gummi candies as well as the prompt delivery."
2,Weather Watcher,"This is a good piece of equipment for temperture & humidy indoor & outdoor. The clock is good as it reads the atomic clock every 4 hours.Its weather forecasting is poor as it can only use pressure readings to forecast & pressure reading alone is minute part of weather forcasting.This unit is to busy, it has to much information in a small space. We are pleased with the unit especially during cold winter days, as it tells youthe outside temperture."
1,IMUS. AMERICA'S COWBOY,"This is a very poorly written book. The author comes across as being too smart by half. For instance she writes of a radio station XELO out of Del Rio, Texas that had an early influence on Imus. She goes on to explain that the station got around FCC transmitter power limitations by locating the transmitter in Juarez. If she had checked her geography she would have noted that Juarez is about 400 miles from Del Rio and the transmitter was actually located across the Rio Grande from Del Rio in what was then called Villa Cuna.She goes on to tell of Imus and his friends doing parodies on a con man named Billy Sol Estes, whom she writes was involved in a salad oil scam, when in fact it was chattle mortages on fertilizer tanks.This may seem like nit picking but given these inaccuracies how does one accept the rest of this book, or any of her other books as being factual?She does give some insights into Imus's character and background that are interesting.....if true."
1,"A Bad, Bad Cd","When i ordered this cd i was thrilled, when it came, i was depressed, this was one of the worst cd's i've ever wasted money on. two thumbs down! I thought, the songs were very bad, and i really hated her voice. I always wonder why i wasted the money on that cd."
2,"nice pictures, sturdy","we use two of these cameras for kite photography, and the pictures turn out great. we've had more than a few crash landings with both cameras and both are still going strong, going on four years. great camera and easy to use, nice pictures even when you just use point and shoot mode."
1,Young Rip off is more like it.,"I pre ordered this dvd, I am a huge fan of the TV show ""Young Justice"". I am not a fan of being gouged by Warner Brothers.a measly 4 episodes? Had I known that I would have not ordered. Please avoid, they will release these either in a box set or the price will drop, save your money.Instead buy the ""Justice League"" full seasons."
1,Ours was unreliable,"The second day we had this, a quarter of the screen went black. We returned it. If you do buy one of these, get the extended warranty because the unit only comes with a 90 day warranty. It's a shame it didn't work well because the design is very convenient."
1,Copper coated aluminum,"Copper coated aluminum, low strand count. Garbage wire; my speakers sing now that I've replaced this aluminum junk with proper oxygen-free copper wires."
1,rotisserie,"First motor did not work, returned the entire item. the second item arrived and the motor sounds so bad , I went out and got an after market motor to use. Everything else is fine the motor is really poor!"
1,Difficult to use Software,"My objective in purchasing this scanner was to be able to place a scanned photo on the same page as some text. After several sessions,I have not found a solution. Scanning is not the problem; rather, sending a scanned image to another application such as word so that one can combine a word document with the image. The software gives no clue and reaching Epson's technical support is a joke. Consider another brand. I'm selling or giving this one away."
2,Great product,"Bought this to make perpetual calendars. Stood up pretty well, is starting to shred a little but I gave it a pretty good work out."
2,Good ancient history lessons for children,"There are 15 to 20 illustrations or photos of artifacts on every page. Iti s very interesting straight history, it's not in story form, and it is good for the type of children who like science or history channel, rather than those who only like fantasy books or movies. So, if your child enjoys facts and history, this is a good supplement for their school history, social studies, through all years of grade school.There is a lot of information and the good thing is that it teaches children only two pages of each ancient culture, so they get a very detailed and broad picture of world cultures as it relates to history. They can relate what they read to what they already know and what they themselves experience, play, compare ancient education to their own school, and so on.All the Dorling Kindersley Books that I've seen are very interesting and detailed and are good for most children."
1,Mediocre,"In a book designed to discuss the mythology surrounding [Robert] Johnson, it seems odd to begin with an information-dump polemicizing against the revisionist practices of the post office."
1,Horrid,"Day one it had problems, one major problem was that it has no glass scan surface so only flat paper items can be copied, no cards or anything else. On the first day we noticed problems but we opened the ink and we couldnt return it. For so long, people have not been able to fax anything in, our copies are horrible, theres a black line running down any copy or fax. DO NOT BUY! SERIOUSLY! This is old equipment too, buy something newer and better."
1,Broke,"My husband loves these pens, and at the price they're somewhat of a splurge. I'll buy them at Office Depot next time since the Amazon-purchased pens exploded inside their barrels, leaking ink all over the mechanism. Booooo!"
1,Lost intrest,"My daughter really wanted this for christmas thinking it would be so cool and wanted to preform magic. But the performance table is pretty lousy and the props there arevcheap and flimsy. My daughter lies that wand and hat but when she cleaned her room, i found out that he put away her kitunderneath her bed and hs never played with it since..... Waste of money."
1,Not very powerful - only lasted a year,I bought this dryer based on the revlon dryer a friend of mine had. It was not the same. This dryer is very weak at blowing my thick hair. After about a year it blew up in my hand and the case on the outside cracked. I recently bought the Conair infiniti pro and I absolutely love it.
1,Completely out of date,"This book offers very little if anything at this point and sounds comical at times referring to, ""The Information Super Highway"" a/k/a Internet and referencing positions that no longer exist."
2,Happy with the Hoover,"Purchased the hoover Flair Bagless Upright in January. We have a small winter home with tile floors in all rooms except the bedrooms. The Hoover does a very good job on the tile and carpeting. It is not noisy, the cord is an adaquate length; you do have to make sure the filter is kept clean for optimum service. For the money, a very good buy."
1,Almost there ...,"5 stars for including the live CD 2. The mastering of the 1st CD isn't bad (I have the earlier Japanese CD to compare to). But like at least one other reviewer mentioned: THE LAST SONG ON CD 1 IS CHOPPED IN HALF !! Unforgivable, but I only bought this for the live CD anyway. And why did they change the cover? Nothing wrong with the original IMO, which is better than this one.There are also ""bits"" of something at the end of tracks 5 and 7 that shouldn't be there.As for disc 2, kind of bright actually. They could have brought up the low end a little more. Also, there are these annoying gaps present between each track that shouldn't exist. (Like what most MP3 players do: insert a gap in between each track.)I guess no one bothered to listen to the finished product."
1,Junk,This product is horrible. The middle part of the play yard will not lock. We haven't even had the chance to use it and it is already broke. It is horrible. I will never buy anything from Evenflo again.
1,Best for couples with kids,"My husband and I have a great relationship, and we are always looking for encouraging devotionals to build us up, and even convict us in areas we need it. This one is ok, but highly geared toward couples with kids. We have only found a few devotionals that focus on the couple with out children, or make the couple the priority of the book. This one does not fit into that category. My husband and I thought it would be better titled for ""Moments together for couples with children"" since so much of the book focus on that are of a couples relationship."
2,Beautiful movie!,"I don't know how many times one of my daughters and I have seen this movie! We really enjoy it. Yes the romance, chivalry, the costumes, the customs, etc are really enjoyed!If you're in to romance, this is the movie to get!"
1,Loved that Red Cape!,"While I loved the red cape and the demonic clown was disgustingly good, this movie was so weak. Character development was nonexistent. We never learned enough about Al Simmons before he is turned into the crispy superhero to really feel for him. We don't see him with Wanda to get a feel for why he would give up his soul for her love. The only thing this movie had was special effects, especially that red cape."
1,Not the Book I Hoped It Would Be,"I was disappointed with this book. I read every page from beginning to end. The reasons for his strategy are interesting but as other reviewers point out here at Amazon, the actual part where he shows you how to use his method is really bad. It has mistakes. It talks about the S&P Industrial Index when it means the SP500 Index. I get the feeling that Michael farmed the last part of the book out to the coauthor. Whatever I suggest just reading the end of the book at the bookstore."
2,from an average reader,"When a book is as highly lauded and unanimously recommended as Revolutionary Road, it invariably fails to live up to the expectations created by its would be cheerleaders. Thankfully, Yate's novel comes damn close to meeting those expectations. The setting may be the 1950's, but the characters are those same wanna-be bohemians you or your friends might become if you're not careful. If you're already in your late 20's with a wife, a kid, and a few shattered dreams, then you should find plenty to relate to in Yates's novel. If that doesn't describe you, then the novel is still a great gut-wrenching portrait of the kind of person you never want to become. The book offers up a pretty bleak point of view, but I'd say it's more like black humor than just a ""depressing for depressing sake"" kind of story."
1,Hooey and Rot,"I do so regret having paid good money for this bunch of claptrap! The alarm bells went off for me even as I read the first few pages and sensed that this book was a turkey. The author did what so many others in recent years have done; she jumped on the ""mind, spirit, body"" bandwagon for an easy buck. She borrowed a little bit of this, and a little bit of that from herbal remedies to Feng Shui to conveniently throw together a pretentious pile of pap. It insults the intelligence of the reader. Also, I found it depressing to be dragged through the final days of her failed marriage, and the implication that we wives should dump our husbands, ""clean house"" as it were, in preparation for this new phase of our lives to be disturbing, indeed. I suppose I should credit the book though because in flatly rejecting it, my confidence that I have the wisdom to manage menopause on my own was greatly strengthened. Notwithstanding, I do not recommend this book."
1,¡No son los Humildes!,Este CD dice que es de los Humildes pero no lo son. En realidad no se quien interpreta estas canciones de Juan Gabriel. Si no fuera porque costó barato lo habria mandado para atrás para que me regresaran el dinero. Que mala onda que dice que son los auténticos Humildes y en realidad es una farsa. Totalmente desatisfecho.
2,great camera for lots of uses,"This was a purchace for work. We needed a camera with easy to read and use settings, easy to take quick snaps shots, as well as good close up, detail shots in close quarters. The flip out display makes it very easy to use in a lot of situations. I bought two, actually-one for my use and one for the department to use. I also bought the same camera for my husband's birthday. It also takes video with sound, for those funny moments at work..."
2,Put aside some time and spend a little money.,"I bought this album because of One Week and a little sample I heard from a friend. It has clever lyrics and a perfect melody that is in every song, but none of them sound alike. From the pop smash One Week to the beatiful When You Dream, this album rocks. It doesn't hit any explosions of wild, uncontrolled noise, so it's easy on the ears. The only bad songs on it are Light Up My Room and I'll Be That Girl. My faves include Some Fantastic, Who Needs Sleep, Call and Answer, and my personal favorite, Never is Enough. It's great to listen to get yourself relaxed at night. I'm mean, who needs sleep? Tell me what's that for."

2,Fine protractor,"I like how the swing arm was offset just right, so you could actually make the correct mark of the angle along the edge of the arm."
2,A Student's Perspective,"This book was required reading for my Civil Rights class. Although at times a bit too detailed and tangent prone, Hemphill's style is very gripping and kept my attention. The way in which the formation and development of Birmingham is disussed, enterpreted, and explained is superb. Hemphill does an excellent job of juxtaposing the racial, economic, and social climate that evolved and gripped the city of Birmingham throughout the years. I would consider this autobiography of sorts a must read for any person interested in issues pertaining to the Civil Rights Movement. Just get through the few dry parts, the rest is well worth the read!"
2,"Great, Practical Gift Making Ideas For Kids - Highly Recommended!","""Gifts In A Jar: For Kids"" is a very cute spiral bound book that contains some great recipes for ""kits"" that are portioned to fit in 1-quart canning jars. We found this on sale at a book liquidator for a lot less than it is being sold here at Amazon. That being said, now that we have seen the book we would have paid the full price.The spiral binding is very useful since it allows the book to stay open when laid out on your counter top. This is handy as you measure out the ingredients to be placed in your canning jar or, as my daughter (16) did for 12 of her classmates, plastic gift bags.The included instruction/gift tags are a nice touch, but we did not want to pull pages out of the book. We just scanned the pages into the computer and printed out the needed copies. You could also make your own labels.Not just for kids, this is a great resource for anyone needing quick and relatively inexpensive homemade gifts.Highly recommended!"
2,Fun mystery,"John Pellam is a great hero! Having gone for a while without a Deaver book fix, I was happy to see that this Location Scout Mystery is in reprint.Scouting a movie location in small-town Cleary, NY, Pellam and his young partner, Marty, are just happy to be almost finished with finding prime shooting locales for the next Hollywood blockbuster. Unfortunately, this small town isn't as thrilled with them, and after a horrible murder, John finds himself fighting for his life, fighting for his reputation and acting as novice detective to clear his name. Along the way, Deaver throws in oddball locals, a love interest, and a twisting, surprising conspiracy.This was a fun read, and I enjoyed it all the way through. The writing is a bit different than some of Deaver's more recent works, but this is a good thing! I'm anxiously awaiting the reprint of the next 2 Location Scout books. Buy this one and enjoy; it doesn't disappoint."
1,I just couldn't wait for it to end & be done with!,"I must disagree with most of the others' comments about this book. I did not find it to be a good read for me. I found it to be very difficult. The style of writing was quite flighty & I often got lost. It felt to me as though the writer was trying too hard - Plain and simple. I didn't bond with the development of the characters at all. I am a huge book fan, and this just doesn't cut it. I suggest reading ""Caramelo"" instead, by Sandra Cisneros."
2,nooice!,"this is a heck of a watch for the money I spent more for much less at wallmart couple years back.I will never use all the features but as a simple chronometer it is well worth the cost, I have to say the thermometer is goofy at best.I will research it and try to make it actually work otherwise I might take off another point as a working thermometer would be handy."
2,Love this book,"I have tried about 4 receipes from this book and the hubby and two young children and my self have all been very happy with them and they are reasonable ingredients to obtain, and seem to be a kit with the kids!! Bonus!!!"
2,Great,Very informative-just what I was looking for. I have enjoyed reading and practicing the Brush work essentials. Would certainly consider this a necessary book for any upcoming artist.
2,2012 Review,"I love the writings of Steve Fry. This book is totally a must! Good pricing, and totally not outdated writing. He Reveals the beauty of worship using God's word and His own experiences. A Good READ!"
1,"Did he have to fulfill some kind of contract, or what?","What a stupid book. The idea of ""skipping Christmas"" is only remotely interesting (news flash - there are lots and lots of people who don't spend $7,000 on gifts, an expensive party, custom Christmas cards, and Christmas decorations every year!!) Its poorly written for starters, and the main character is just pompous and mean and inspires no sympathy, who really cares if he skips Christmas? It reads like some creative writing assignment from a junior high schooler. He obviously was hoping to cash in by writing this slapdash little story in about ten minutes and selling it to people for the price of a hardback. If you're a normal person who doesn't have a special stationery boutique that takes it upon themselves to phone you personally to design your Christmas cards (ever hear of Walmart?) then you will not relate to the characters in this book."
1,"Oops, she did it again...",After reading this book I can't tell if Ann Coulter is evil or just plain stupid. I found her arguments lacking serious logical merit. Throughout the book Coulter shows no interest in making a logical point but rather seeks to destroy her opponent's and silence dissident opinions. Each page of this book was like reading one paranoid accusation after another (based on what are probably her own neurotic impulses).Ann Coulter reminds me of a modern day Ava Braun in a Prada suit. The girl who used to get drunk at college frat parties on jello shots only to go home with various members of the football team. The girl who woke up one day and decided to salute the party to the farthest extremes by spouting their rhetoric with hateful furor.
2,lone wolf:small book with a big bite,"The writer transforms the legend of Lone wolf and cub from a classic samurai manga into a pseudo samurai jack comic. The artwork and the action packed storyline is the best thing about the volume. However due to the small size of the book,it can be lost easily. Never the less, if you love stories about samurai then you will like this book."
1,So so,"For general kitchen use the mixer appears to be alright, we had it for about 3 years now. We don't make bread nor do we use it every day but it gets used 3-5 times a week.The whisk attachment is total junk! The wires came out of it within first 2 months of having it, maybe got 6 uses out of the whisk. Replacement parts are expensive and not of good quality either. It is somewhat loud and pricy for the quality.I can't compare it to Kitchenaid ( I wish I could) but I wouldn't recommend Cuisanart standup mixer again."
1,No Customer Support,"I bought this software and was unable to load it on my computer. My computer met the minimum requirements, but after I came home and tried to load it on the computer it would not load. Come to find out, XP users may have difficulty.....WHAT? It says XP on the box. When I tried to get support, they have no phone number, no e-mail (fishy for a software company) and you have to write them a letter, which they never write back. DO NOT BUT ANYTHING FROM VALUSOFT!"
2,Jermaine Stewart,A great follow up to his previous album. He had style and class. A great mix of pop and soul that makes you feel groovy and romantic!
2,liz,wow what a great come back of micheal meyers. I love the fact that i was able to purchase my halloween collection at such a great price at Amozon.com.
2,Works.,"This product is great. Good antioxidant and you need to use on a daily basis. If you don't get much fruit in you diet, this is for you."
2,Dragonball is ACE,"this season is amazing just like all the rest the only problem with the dragonball seasons is that they are R1 and R4 but the dragonball Z and GT are R1,R2,R4 and R5"
2,Good Basic Overview,"I have used this book for several years to teach a ""Bible 101"" class. It is a very good resource for learning a basic overview of the entire Bible, from the geography and structure to the main characters, themes and teachings. It is a great catalyst for a follow-up in-depth class."
1,"HATE IT, HATE IT, HATE IT!!!",This thing does NOT work like it's supposed to. There are no odors UNTIL you open the darn thing to get the diapers out and then it's horrible! The smell is literally gagging....I think it's a combination of the scented bags plus the yucky diapers but it's downright gross. Ours never cut the bags like it was supposed to and the diapers never stayed twisted half the time. I stopped using it long ago and now put our dirty diaper in ziplock sandwich bags and then in the trash. SAVE YOUR MONEY....DON'T BUY THIS...!
2,"Would be a 5 star, but no breathe.","This is one of the best U2's dvd. Not as good as slane, but as great as Zoo TV. I think these are the top 3 U2 dvds.Audio 5/5Image 4/5 not really HDUnlike the Elevation and Vertigo show, the editing is not annoying, I actually liked it a lot, gets 2 thumbs up!If you a are a casual U2 you can't loose on this dvd.For fans we get the 2 dvd pack, which is really cool.For die hard fans, you get the $100 set."
2,Solid melodic ambient,"The term ""ambient music"" is used in so many contexts today that even the subgenres (""dark ambient"", ""space music"", and a world of other headings, all used by different to describe wildly different sounds). Yet Carpet Musics' Weekday can only be described as ambient sound. It's not pure synths--some conventional instruments are also used. The resulting sound isvery pleasing, quiet, atmospheric music with a strong hint of pop sound. This is good music to relax and enjoy. There's nothing earth-shatteringly new here, and the pace is quiet and easy, not rip-roaring. But Weekday is a perfect sound for the""need to concentrate"" times, or for the times when a stressful day requires non-saccharine release. Carpet Musics has done a worthwhile CD here, for the fan of ""quiet melodic ambience"".This is more in the pop tradition than the new age tradition (thank goodness), but it is really more atmospheric than either genre. A good purchase."
1,NOT VEGAN,"This product is NOT VEGAN. LEGALLY, something cannot be labeled as vegan if it has BEESWAX in it. I am using it because I bought it and I opened it without noticing the label so some bees suffered somewhere for it for no reason if I throw it out, but I am really ****ing pissed that this was labeled vegan and it is not."
1,Padding is too thin.,"The bed has a nice, durable nylon base material. The top plaid material is soft. The bed is easy to clean using a vacuum cleaner. However, the padding is too thin. I had the model smaller than this one, but it got torn apart in a fit of rage by my shephard/lab. When I was looking for a replacement bed, I read a review that said these beds have padding that is too thin, and that two pads for a single bed is needed. That gave me an idea. I bought a new bed, and put the pad from the torn-apart bed into it. I pinned the pads together, and the bed is now really soft and plush. My dog loves it. Keep in mind that I was forced to get another bed since my dog shredded the first one. It really does need more padding. I was fortunate in that I had padding from my first bed I could still use to supplement the new one I just bought. If I knew how thin the padding was, I wouldn't have bought the first bed. If this is the scenario you are in, avoid this bed."
1,"Half done, bored, skipping pages, and the ending is poor?","I loved Bonfire and think the comparisons by the so-called experts are ridiculous. This book is tedious, the characters don't interest me at all and I'm halfway through. I find myself like many of your readers skipping many pages because I know where each scene is headed or I don't care enough to find out. I want to finish the book but the thought that I will come upon a lousy ending is truly disheartening. Just like the movie reviewers, I wish we had literary critics who were more honest. You can like the man and not like this book and should tell us so."
1,Not very durable,"I was disgusted when this camera stopped working after only 1 week. I bought the A560 to take on vacation, and kept it well-stored in a padded case. With less than 200 shots, the lens cover stopped opening/closing, and then the view screen died. (You could still preview a shot in movie mode, but not in camera mode, and you could still review stored pics - very strange.) The AA batteries tend to last only about 75 pictures, by the way, so keep plenty on hand. I had bought a Canon this time because neither of my Kodaks had held up more than one year, but I returned this and bought a Kodak Z712 instead."
2,Such a great movie,"I've seen a lot Chinese action movies, but I've never seen anything like this. Exaggerate Kong Fu, mixed with scientific effects, just awesome. It is funny, yet serious. It is weird, yet interesting. Totally recommend it to every body, especially those who love action movies."
1,This movie lacks as the sequel to Gone With the Wind,"This movie should not have Gone With the Wind as the prequel. I thought the characters would not act like they did so I was dissappointed. Also, the movie was too long. It is six hours long!"
2,Very readable and informative.,"An excellent book for the general reader not familiar with the subject. Learning to recognize situations and ""name"" them is a very powerful tool."
2,Bounce youre way out of here,"I should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from Squaresoft, it is like a jazzed up version of Streets of Rage or something. It has many good things about it, and many bad things.First off, graphics are amazing, and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it. By all means this is a great game, it's got story, it's pretty fun, and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever.However, the game is extremely short, about an hour or two, depending if you skip movies or not. And after beating the game a few times, the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds. I would like to have seen more RPG elements in this game, instead of movies then fighting.If you want to showoff your playstation 2, or you have some freinds to fight with, then this game is for you. However, if you are more of an RPG-er and not much for just battle games, then just rent the game first."
2,Good Experience,"I was going to rate this five stars but my more objective side said, ""Naw, four.""I liked this movie better than the first -- it tweeked up the action and the dramatization (a little more `Hollywoodish').A Special Note: This is FICTIONAL history, although it does to a greater than lesser extent follow actual historical events. Hence, do not expect this to be accurate to a fault; just enjoy it for what it is -- enjoyable and entertaining so much so that I await the next installment.P.S.: It's great to be able to discover a better than mediocre action, drama type movie without excessive violence, offensive sex scenes and language. For this, at least, it deserves my support."
2,This lock has successfully resisted attack,"I've had this lock for over a year and it's still protecting my bike. I have noticed a few digs into it, penetrating the plastic sheath and showing a little wear on the metal interior, meaning it's successfully thwarted theft attempts. U-locks are awesome and sometimes I want to cut someone's dinky chains (and not take the bike) just to show that they should really get a U-lock."
2,One of my Favorite Woods Books,I have read all of Stuart Woods books and this one and palindrome seem to have become my favorites. I recently reread New York Dead and it was once again a fresh and enjoyable read. I had a hard time putting it down for the second time. Like most of his books they are are a good fast read with characters who pull you into the story.
2,"Good Info, Some Typos","The subject of Adobe Camera Raw is covered well. There are some typos when talking about the controls in the Basic tab. In ACR version 4.* the Shadows adjustment has been renamed to Blacks. The author makes a point of discussing the change but then proceeds to call the control by it's old name, Shadows instead of Blacks."
1,Ok when brand new but depth adjust needs an overhaul.,The depth adjust has way too much play in it and slips regularly. It was awkward and not well designed even when brand new. Controlling depth should be one of the most important features in a router and this one fails here. You'll wish you never bought this the moment you ruin the piece you're working on.
2,Excellent intro to early Arvo Part,"Of the many Part cds I've listened to and/or owned, this is the best introduction to his earlier work. It includes some familiar titles that are available in other recordings, like Summa and Fratres, but these earlier versions are different in interesting ways. ""Wenn Bach Bienen Gezuchte Hatte"" is almost worth the price of the cd and doesn't get recorded much for some reason."
1,Aliens for everybody,"In the future of man kind, the leprechaun has become something of a threat to human existence. He hijacks a space craft to catch a spoiled princess and kill some dumb jocks with guns. Their only hope is the ship's female doctor and any member of the crew with a brain. Starts off well for a space movie with a refreshingly calm performance by the leprechaun. But the whole film goes to hell fast as it fails to use anything new to keep our attention focused. The viewer is left pretty happy to see it end."
2,Works great,"I had read that this firewire didn't work for some people, so I was worried. But it is working absolutely perfectly for me to download high-def video from my Sony HDR-HC5 to my MacBook Pro."
2,invicta 8926 watch,"for $85 A GREAT buy. if your looking for a big, bold watch and do not want to pay rolex prices this is one to check out"
1,This book kind of sucked,"I didnt really like this book, I didn't find it scary at all it made me unintrested and not want to read it. There was really no mistery to keep you on the eagde of your seat."
2,The Two and Only,"We will never see the likes of these two wonderful guys again. Their deadpan, absurd humor manages to be both mundane and other worldly. I think they started or refined the comedy of inertia. Their characters in skits never seem to get anywhere or accomplish anything, and the not getting there is hilarious. I'm afraid a lot of the younger generation won't get their type of humor, which doesn't rely on shock or vulgarity, but that is their genius. To me, they have been like two demented uncles that I love to just listen to. I wish there was a lot more video of them on this DVD, but the final piece is a delight to see them at work. I love these guys."
1,A total let down,"I have been a fan of Skid Row and espically Sebastian Bach for the last 15 years and was very excited to hear he was putting out a DVD. The DVD was a total let down. The concert footage sound is terrible, and the excerpts from his VH1 special were boring. I will forever be a fan, but don't bother with this one for your collection."
2,Chellie's done it again!,"I've been waiting for Chellie to come out with a new book since about five mintues after I finished her first one, The Wealthy Spirit. I love Chellie's positive and pragmatic approach to wealth, not to mention her sense of humor. I've turned many friends on to her earlier book, and am sure I'll do the same with Zillionaire.If you ask me, $16.95 is a small price to pay for Chellie's priceless life wisdom!"
1,Useless quality control,"Owned a Sonicare original for over 10 years until the batteries finally wouldn't hold charge for about 2 days. Bought a new e5500. After 24hrs of charging it will run for about 2 minutes. If unused, it doesn't hold a charge after 30 minutes (elapsed time, not 30 minutes of use!).Seems like the Philips buy-out ruined their quality control. Very unhappy with this product."
1,An unfortunate disappointment,"I have been a Neil Diamond fan for 15 years and discovered with this album that his voice is certainly not what it used to be. If you're looking for his greatest early tunes, make sure you get the originals. Save the live tunes for when you actually go to the performance. He will always be an awesome performer."
1,"Not as unlikeable as it should be, but still","Ivy annoyed me. I'll just put that out there right from the start. I found her character grating at times. She was whiney and pathetic, as well as devious and mean. Combine that with the very preach tone of a lot of the book, and I should be rating it a lot lower than I am. And yet, somehow, the book was still tolerable - and I'm not sure how. Looking back on it, thinking about it analytically, I should have hated it. But I'll rate it as 'just okay'. It would be a good commuter audio book, I don't know that I'd invest free time in listening to it."
2,A classic!,"The Clark's Desert Boot, what more can I say other than it's a classic that I get compliments on daily!I ordered a half size down from what I normally wear (us 10 down to 9.5) and they feel great, I may have been able to go down to a 9 but I didn't want to chance it.Amazon delivered expeditiously as always, while having the cheapest price i found!I had received some advice to try Clark's as this is my first pair. They look great no matter what I wear them with and I know that I bought a quality item, The beeswax finish is beautiful!"
2,Travel stick,The stick is great to use to get the blood flowing in your legs before a contest or match.
1,"Good content, but...","Male mate kissing a fellow male mate.. Hey mate, male don't mate with male mate. Male dogs don't mate with male dogs, same with cats, horses and all mammals in the world, why humans want to be the exception and promoted in this show? I know it is science fiction and that is acceptable, but male mate kissing male mate is not good science fiction and it is also not natural, mate. Thanks, mate!!"
1,bit set,"product was shipped quickly and everything looked good untill I used the bits and found several were not true and couldnt be used. Some of the ones with a hole in center for security torx, the hole wasn't in the center so I couldn't use them either. I don't bother a company fussing with them, I'm the consumer that just don't go back to them again. I would not have written a review normally, but Amazon bugged me thru my e-mail to write a review, bottom line is that I do not think very much of the product."
1,I agree with Mark Twain,"I read opinions before buy this product. At beginning it worked nice. Then a ""no disc"" message is all it does. I will not buy Philips electronics again."
1,Does This Toy Work?,I don't like it a lot because I can't figure out how it kicks. The directions don't make that much sense.I would like it if I could figure out the directions. I would like this toy if it worked.
2,Dead or Alive?,"This book is about Sunny and her family. She has, well had, a older sister named Jasmine, but everyone called her Jazz. Their parents named them after flowers. When Jazz dies in a fire, their family falls apart. Then one day a letter arrives from Jazz. The return address says only, Jasmine. Sunny thinks it is really from her, because Jazz always thought everyone would know where she is. The letter said that Jazz was alive and coming home. Sunny doesn't believe it is Jazz, she thinks it is someone disguised as her. She finds out, that what she thought was true and the girl leaves. But her parents say they will talk about it again, and it never happened. So she calls her grandma, who no one, except her, likes. Her grandma says she thought it up. She shows her, the proof. Her grandma says she wrote it, because she can forge anyone handwritting."
1,Zell Miller would have hated JFK,"To the moron from PA (Samuel Noriega) who reviewed this book before me: Republicans hated JFK and would have hated him even more today, considering his adulterous affairs and him being a Northeastern liberal from Massachusetts and all. JFK was a liberal, and no doubt he would have opposed King Bush II and supported John Kerry, just like his brother Ted Kennedy.Keep in mind JFK was even MORE LIBERAL than his brothers RFK and Teddy, and both RFK and Teddy ended up becoming poster boys for the liberal Left. But then again since you are an illiterate idiot Mr. Noriega (a fitting name for you), I wouldnt have expected you to know this."
1,Play Oblivion Instead,"I have not been able to play the game. Every time I have attempted to, it restarts my system. I have downloaded all the ""patches"", installed, uninstalled, and over again trying to get this game to work on my pc which does fall within all of the specified game requirements to be able to play the game. Obviously there is a huge problem with the game and I can not understand how a game publisher/game developer would release this without working out these major issues. Also, I am out the money it cost me for the program, since they have all of the laws against piracy which leaves me with a game that doesn't work, and without the money that it cost me for this glorified coaster."
1,Where's the rest of it?,"Was this just a hiccup in the Cat Who.... series? This book is so thin, just like the plot and everything else going on in the book. The paperback version will probably be 50 pages long. There have been over a dozen books in the series, dedicated readers don't need to be reminded of back story ad nauseum at this point. I always look forward to a night of reading new adventures of Koko, Yum-Yum, and Qwill, but when my book arrived in the mail, I was disappointed that it would be more or less an hour of reading. It's as though it's an afterthought to the last book, as though the author forgot stuff to mention."
2,Knitting Basics and More,"Very helpful to the beginning knitter. The instructions, along with the pictures were very precise, and included alternativesfor completing each area of a knitting project."
2,Halo-The Awsome Adventure,"Halo was the first game I got for my X-box console. I heard a lot of good stuff about it and wanted to know what all of it was about. I started playing and knew I'd be hooked. I love first-person shooting games, and this is the best one I've ever played. Also, unless you don't like minor blood or you get dizzy, anyone can play this great game. You don't kill humans or anything (unless you play multiplayer, which is one of the best aspects of the whole game), so it's cool. The only drawback is the complicated controls, but you get used to it after a bit of playing."
2,Great software for to make your own DVD's.,"Tsunami software Encoder XPress will convert your files to mpeg2 format, which is good quality for to use in a DVD authoring software. You can get Tsunami 3 pack suite, which has this Encoder, an Editor (which I don't need), and a good Authoring software as #3 piece. This Tsunami 3 pack is a sure way to make your own DVD's. It sure is quality better than Creator 9 or Nero stuff. This is good software. Do know that the Encoder is slow to translate files, which is it's main job. However, it might be that all Encoders are slow. This Tsunami Encoder does the job good, and can make a mpeg2 file of the highest order, which can be sent to an Authoring software. It's good."
1,Have not received it yet,"I am sure this will be a great magazine, but I have not received my first issue yet."
2,Groundbreaking,"This is Wolverine at his finest.This 1982 miniseries by comics giants Chris Claremont and Frank Miller deviated from the medium's accepted format at the time, eschewing thought bubbles in favor of the now-standard internal monologue. And what an internal monologue it is!Logan is depicted here as a deeply troubled but honorable man, a modern day samurai looking to find his place and reclaim his one true love.Claremont's script is tight and compelling. However, it also appears infused with some of Miller's trademark noir influences. Speaking of Miller, his pencils are perfect for this story. He draws the most ferocious, yet noble, Wolverine I've ever seen, on par with John Byrne's iconic Wolvie. For 1982, this is as brutal a mainstream book as you'll find.Claremont and Miller perfectly capture all the elements of Logan's character that Marvel has seemingly tossed out over the last decade."
2,Great introduction to sign carving!,"I purchased this book about 2 years ago and have read it cover to cover about 20 times! There is a lot to digest for a beginner. In any case, I found numerous helpful tips from everything from router set up, techniques. It helped me to learn the science and the art of sign carving. I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning how to carve signs. There also are some great videos out there to actually see how the techniques are done. Enjoy! Good investment!"
2,Understand and instrument your site,"Nothing is more frustrating than launching a site and not knowing if or how it's being used. This book gives you 100 different solutions for finding out who is coming to the site, where they are coming from and what they are doing. And there is an awful lot to know. The hacks that I liked took it to the next level by not only finding out what people were doing but using that information to develop customer loyalty.This is an impressive work on an under-covered topic. I highly recommend it."
1,Fancy look but doesn't make good coffee,"Product looks nice and sleek with the stainless steel top and glow in the dark clock, but doesn't make great coffee. The temperature is never hot enough even when it is set to ""HOT"". It also started leaking from the back every time I use it. (which is not that often) I would rather pay for a cup of coffee in the neighborhood than use this machine!"
1,Disappointment,"I agree with the other reviews. This so-called ""Unrated"" DVD is certainly not. It has been edited so heavily, it could almost have just a PG-13 rating. And the editing was so obvious. If you could find the original unedited version it would be worth it. Athena Massey is very nice to look at. But this heavily edited version just leaves you disappointed."
1,Brando Sleepwalks Through Dull Western,"Co-star John Saxon memorably summed up the basic storyline of ""The Appaloosa"" (1966): ""Boy meets horse, boy loses horse, boy gets horse."" No wonder Marlon Brando looks bored in this lackluster effort - he's doing little more than fulfilling a Universal contract. Russell Metty's impressive photography is offset by the pretentious direction of Sidney J. Furie. It's a pity that Brando never made a truly outstanding Western."
2,Wool socks,Highly recommended. These are the only socks my husband will wear now. I am so glad they are available through Amazon. The price is just as good as purchasing through the product website.
1,a good behind the scenes artist,as a writer she is alright but vocally she still seems to be a mary j clone.the album doesn't go anywhere it's typical puffy infested material.very run of the mill.
1,Not ergonomic.,"Bought this scoop because of all the great reviews. Was disappointed pretty much right of the bat. Yes, the scoop is big, and yes it's sturdy, but the angle of the handle is so steep relative to the shovel, that when you have to apply any pressure, you have to make your wrist do the work, rather than your whole arm as it is with most other scoops. Also as some have mentioned, the gaps are pretty big, and after a few days of scooping, the litter had lots of little debris floating in it. This could be a great scoop if they lowered the angle a little and reduced the gap size. I'm going to give this to someone else hoping they like it and will try the other metal scoop available here on Amazon...Edit:Added a picture of my scoop, I received a brown one."
2,Thought the book was great.,"It's hard to imagine someone who has been through what Delores has been through, but then that is why I read. I found the first half of the book very depressing. She could not get a break. I felt all of her problems came from her isolation. There was absolutely no one that she could honestly share her problems with or get any kind of advice from. She had to rely solely on her own experience - a rather dour prospect. As the book comes to an end, the character of Delores finally blossoms as she uses all of our life experiences to be so loving and empathetic to isolated people like herself - the Mr. Pesci's and Roberta's of the world. I was touched by the real family she finally created for herself. Bravo for Delores and Wally Lamb. I am looking forward to his next novel."
2,Ross' Atlas of Descriptive Histology,This book covers an immense variety of histological images that are a good review right before a histology image test. Comments and descriptions associated with each image are extremely useful and surprisingly insightful.
2,5 plus stars,Top Seller Book! I dearly love this book and would recommend it to every church going person in the world. You MUST read this book. Thanks Jane for your work.
1,Lots in common with vacuum cleaners . . .,"Oh, it's authentic all right - an authentic pick-up band (hopefully) sight-reading isolated parts from marching band arrangements. Poor voicings, arrangements and technically sloppy - at best! I believe this is the worst recording I have ever heard of a more-or-less professional recording group. Buy it if you must, in quantity even, and make a beeline for the nearest skeet range so this recording will not have been made in vain. I do believe I smell horses . . ."
2,Finest work since Ten Summoners Tales - Simply Brilliant,"This is an album that needs repeated listening and reading of the lyrics as you listen, it will definitely grow on you. The song with the silliest title has to be Stolen Car (Take Me Dancing), this song however is amazing. Sting has always been a brilliant songwriter, bassist, guitarist, etc. I highly recommend this album as well as his new book, ""Broken Music"" I've just started this book and it's quite fascinating."
1,No fun without a joystick,"Great game on the PC, but it stinks without joystick compatability. In fact the designers must of known how difficult it would be to navigate the game with a D pad, so they didn't even bother hiding the invincibility option.You can also download the entire FMV sequence on a fan website, making this game a complete waste."
2,New to philosophy,"I read this book last semester in my Philosophy 100 class. I thought it was probably the most influential to me because I seem to share a lot of views with Fromm and he can be easier to read than I thought Nietzche was. Very interesting, if you want to read some philosophy and make sense of it, I would recommend this one."
1,Piece of garbage,Piece of garbage. Super annoying to reassemble after washing. Can't get the thing to seat onto the base easily. Seems to cut stuff to smithereens in like 2 seconds. Which makes it hard to make a decent pico using the thing.Probably deserves 2 stars but I'm giving it 1 to balance out all the overly positive reviews.
2,The Best,"I'm in love with Stacey's music for almost 15 years and this album stands as my favorite CD of her. Forget about Stacey queen of the dance floor, anthemic club songs as ""Two of Heart"" or ""We Connect"". Boomerang is totally different, more country-influenced, with a rich variety of music: pop, rock, and more. Stacey put her heart into this effort and the result is breathtaking and heavently. One of the rare CD I can listen to over and over. Definitly one of the best CD ever and Stacey's best work to date. BUY IT NOW"
1,Filter is a pain and expensive,"I have had other sink filtering units before and normally I would get a few months out of each filter. I don't even filter the water I cook with. Just drinking water this current filter lasts me about 3 weeks. Not kidding. It will be a slow drip after 2-3 weeks of use. You can continue to use it, but filling a 12oz glass of water will take 5 minutes."
2,Men of Courage,"I found this book to be an eye-opener to the battle of March 2, 1968. My husband was with B Company (Manchu). It hurts my heart to read of the wounded and dead. The Brotherhood of these brave men is beyond words as being a woman I don't think I could have gone through what these men did. The tragedy unfolds in this book very stirringly. The writer made me feel as if I was there. I would recommend it to everyone. In fact, I've already started recommending it to people I've talked to. I would like to thank L.D. James for writing this book and all the men who participated in their input because I know it wasn't easy to talk about since it brought back the bad feelings of the conflict.RNTaylor50@yahoo.com."
1,Not so great,"Billy's voice is now just ordinary, a victim of puberty, and his choice of material is tired and boring. Buy some of his earlier work because this is pretty poor."
1,The Numbers Are Wrong:,"Mr. Buchanan should have looked up some demographic numbers, and trends.The West is not unique, it's just a little ahead of the curve. Take a look at some TFR's -- Total Fertility Rates (numbers of children born in a woman's lifetime. Note that 2.1 is replacement level:Iran: 2.01 (Twenty years ago, over 5)Turkey: 2.12 (Twenty years ago, over 5)Tunisa: 1.99 (Twenty years ago, over 6)Indonesia: 2.58 (Twenty years ago, over 6)Most Islamic countries, particularly the bigger ones, are well into the ""demographic transition"" to lower birth rates. Even ones which still have high birth rates have started on it -- eg., in Pakistan the percentage of married women who use contraceptives has gone from less that 4% in 1989 to more than 35% in 2001.The whole world, not just the West, is headed towards stable or declining populations. We just pioneered it.Mr. Buchanan should find something more credible to worry about."
1,Overrated,I heard this book was amazing. A must-read. It isnt. The plot is pretty good. I was drawn in by the writing and intrigued by the subject. But the relationships are not very believable and the ending was just ridiculous fluff. Don't waste your time unless you're REALLY hard up for something to read.
2,Love this Tool,I have a smaller 128 and needed more space. I am a Tech and uses these almost every day. I love the protective rubber holder on these models.
2,Excellent!,"I have used this product for the past 10 years for my two beagles. They have never had fleas. Unfortunately, I did not pick it up this spring and, for the first time, they got fleas. I used this on them and within a week - no more itching, no more fleas. Be sure you stay consistent each month with applying it, otherwise it will lose its effectiveness."
1,WHY DID I BUY THIS BOOK?,"Thank God I bought it USED!!! This was the WORST, UNBELIEVEABLE, book of Robinson's that I have read, and I have read them all!"
1,ripped off,Advertised as new. Obviously not. Does not hold a charge as well as my old battery which has been in my phone for 2+ years.1 star because there's no option for 0.
2,One of Hossam Ramzy's best! Wonderful rhythem changes,"Excellent, dancable music. Lots of variety in rhythem changes and dance moods"
1,Coming down fast,"Not the most riveting book out there about the Manson clan, with large sections of the text lifted virtually verbatim from ""Helter Skelter"".Murphys' original material is also fairly unenlightening . For interesting new information on the subject read Jess Bravins' sensitive biography of Lynette Fromme, ""Squeaky""."
1,garden gnome,"A real let down the pictures look so good, but in reality they are very small and get lost outdoors in a garden setting, the plants overwhelm them, good price but they are not very practical"
2,damn tight,"This is a fun game that exercised your mind. Not only is luck of the draw involved, but also stradegy. curves are thrown at you all the time. I highly reccomend this game. The only down side is the graphics. If you think pokemon is to kiddish for you, get this, it's much more mature.yuuuuuuuuuugiiiiiiiiiohhhhhhhh (sorry, can't resist)"
2,Makes the cut!,"So far so good! Ingrediants are half way decent,(still don't like the added sugar) fair price, kids like them and I have even noticed a change in their behavior as well."
2,Absolutely brilliant!,"George Lamond is absolutely brilliant in this new reggaton cd. Together with K7, he has created a danceable cd that you won't be able to stop listening to! Once again, George has showed us his unique ability to adapt to the changing latin music world and has his finger on the pulse of what's hot. I highly recommend this cd!"
2,Trice's Review,"I believe that California Suite is one of the funniest plays that i have ever read. I am fairly new to Neil Simon, but I have enjoyed everything that I have read from him so far."
2,"What a ""dream"" girl, call Sasha and make a date.","Sasha Grey is a porno star (she won an award for her performances).Her customers are long-term. They view her as a girlfriend and not a prostitute. I won't ruin her line, but her character explains that she becomes what her customer's want and not her real self.No, this is not a great movie. However, it deserves more attention that it's received.As players walk around the pool table looking for their shot, let me say that one view of the movie would be guys are looking for love in all the wrong places. Yet another view is these men want and are willing to pay for the ""dream"" girl - the dream being what they want at the moment since they eventually change girlfriends.Thoughtful movie."
1,Terrible,"Terrible acting, terrible writting, terrible movie. Took me 3 days just to get through it. Got someone you want to punish? Refer them to this movie."
1,1 star being kind,"100% agree with the reviewer Ron Sullivan.This is a piece of crap. Even the forced sex scene can save this piece of s..t.What I still can't understand about Uwe Boll is, if we already knows he makes bad movies, box-office flops...how the hell he is capable of putting on a cast like this? Ben Kingsley, Billy Zane, Michael Madsen...damn!See it at your own risk. You already have plenty of advises here to not do so."
1,unsuitable for music because it skips constantly...,"unsuitable for music because it skips constantly...very disappointing!don't buy this if you want to use it for music!it works with my 2nd generation ipod nano, but it noticeably skips constantly.it's fine for voice memos, but why bother building a stereo mic then...?very disappointed by Griffin!i would have returned it, but I gave it to a friend to record his lectures instead."
1,Not worth the money,The story is not bad but certainly not the best. However what gets me is paying almost $3.50 for a book that's smaller than a 3 x 5 index card. So be warned.
2,Exellent! My absolue favorite CD,"I love this CD! I take it evrywhere. Riding to school, mowing the lawn, playing my PC games, and working on my website. want to give it 6 stars :)"
2,"great rollers, long & heavy hair","I have very thick hair and it's really long (almost to bottom of my breast). All my hair fits in the rollers given but I do suggest getting the white clips to use with the product. These do not ""curl"" my hair but adds great bounce and fullness to it. Heats up fast and curls fast too. I'm able to get the kids ready with the curlers in my hair, even though they are a little heavy because they are ceramic. Would definitely recommend!!"
1,Leaks,So much for being remanufactured. Mine had a leak in one of the gauages. Don't waste your time with this piece of junk.
2,Load testing is the best way to test batteries.,"I first purchased an inexpensive battery tester that only checks the voltage. This was not useful at all. As noted by another reviewer, the battery voltage without load is a poor test of the battery. A bad battery can show almost full voltage. Load testing is the best way to test batteries. I find this unit works perfect on alkaline batteries.I have found a problem with testing 1.2 volt NiMH AA and AAA rechargeable batteries. The battery tester showed a good charge and yet the batteries would not operate a device properly. I found that the old batteries would also not hold a charge. I suspect the tester should place a higher load when testing these batteries. If your rechargeable batteries are old, and do not show 100% after a week or two after a charge then replace them if they are not doing the job."
2,Simply A Fantastic Soundtrack,"Everyone who loves music, both old and new should go get the Parent Trap soundtrack. The songs featured are just great. The song ""LOVE"" by Nat King Cole is the best. Other wonderful songs include ""There She Goes"", ""Top of the World""."
1,Kindle edition no-nos,"The Kindle edition, as of 8-21-2011, has no table of contents, which it desperately needs, and horrible formatting. The html version at Project Gutenberg is better than this one. Hopefully some day these will all be fixed. It really sucks having to click though page after pager after page just to find the story you're looking for, when simply clicking it in the index would bring you there in no time.It's free. Download it and check it out for yourself.*edit*Someone in another color book review mentioned that there is a collection of all of these that is much better anyways. Check it out."
1,sell outs,"this album ranks along brittaney spears and hilary duffsell out musiciansthey were good back in the days of dude ranch and chesire catthat was good punk rocknow their just like the other ones; sum 41, good charolleteuntalented and very boringi wouldve stopped buying their music at ""Enema""wouldnt buy their new one cause i can spot the beat and rythym a mile away"
2,What took you so long? Amazing,Ordered 3 bags when they frist came out. What took you so long to start selling these things? I hope you didn't throw them out in the past. There great. I just ordered 3 more bags and had to try the hodgepodge too. Just got here and i'm not at all disappointed in the selection i got. Jelly belly's at a great price and look at all the new flavors. Ronnie Reagan would be proud. Thanks again
1,Disappointed!,"I loved the 70's AG, but I couldnt help but think all the way through this CDGawd!He sounds like Tina Turner during her 'Private Dancer' days.(For most folks that would be a compliment)--but 4 AG?no way!'I Can't Stop' seems to sample all the '70s hits and it just doesn't work. I think AG made a secular CD because his friend Willie was ailing.Al Green should take a few lessons from Allen Toussaint.Stay true to Urself!!!"
2,Tennis whodunnit does not disappoint,"Having a vested interest in tennis, I have always enjoyed stories with tennis in the background including the movies 'Match Point','Wimbledon' and 'Strangers on a Train'. The combination of tennis and Harlan Coben was therefore hard to resist. Coben always tends to write tightly plotted novels that do not just plod along but actually race with several twists along the way to the finish line. With the U.S. Open Tennis Tournament as the setting of the initial murder, the story integrates this with an earlier murder of a senator's son and a few other killings along the way. Nothing is obvious and what seems obvious changes constantly and the author devilishly takes the reader from one wrong assumption to another to a satisfactory conclusion. Definitely worth reading even if one is not into tennis."
2,"Great product, very powerful","Delivery was prompt. I have used prescription estrogen in the past. I would equate this product with the pharmaceutical. It is very powerful, I use only half the recommended dose, and not every day. After a few days, I started to feel much better, with improved mood. I noticed too my hair started to get much longer. The main reason I purchased this product is that it is used externally, avoiding the possibility of negative impact on the kidneys and liver. I do recommend it. I want to add I am not using the full dose, which I found too strong. A little of this product will go a long way. I purchased two, I do not want of run out."
1,"Delicious, then irritating","I was lovin' this book up to the scene where the title's meaning is revealed. Loved the nine pairs of woodcuts, each with one tiny, crucial difference; loved the history of book-bindings and -burnings. Loved the meditations on the greatness of Dumas and other swashbuckling trash; loved the allusions to Sherlock Holmes. I was hooked, for a while, on the occult events, baroque settings, and twisty plot. But the ending was the lamest ""faux-po-mo"" cop-out imaginable. Bah humbug! I said, and threw the book across the room. I exchanged it for ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""A Scandal in Bohemia."""
2,Dranzer S=Awesome,"Dranzer S is AWESOME. I have lost a few times because it sometimes lands in the penalty pit but that's the only problem. It can spin maybe up to 1 minute and 40 seconds alone if your a strong launcher. If you get Dranzer F and the electronic launcher, you're not going to have any trouble winning."
2,A delightful read for middle-grade kids,"School Days Daze is a novel for young adults, narrated from the perspective of a twenty-two year old young man as he remembers his days at Rootstown. Packed with joy, challenges, and wacky adventures such as the great French Fry Feud, School Days Daze is a delightful read for middle-grade kids, and also lends itself well to being read aloud for story time. Catchy poems intersperse the upbeat vignette stories in this warmly recommended novel. ""Dodge Ball War"": Curls in her hair / A pretty dress / Bows, blue and red / Grab the ball / Fling it through the air / And knock her on the head // It's picture day / Shirts and shoes and ties / Running in circles / Getting all sweaty / Avoiding where the ball flies // We should stay neat / All prim and proper / But that would be a bore. / Hey this is recess / It's important business / And it's all part of dodge ball war!"
1,the worst chemical brothers cd ever!!,"This cd flat out sucks. First off, techno isn't supposed to have words, and second if you were going to have lyrics, why in god's name would you pick noel gahlager. He has the worst voice ever. I loved exit planet dust, but this can't even be labeled as techno, it's more like pop/rock. If you like oasis, and like pop/rock/techno/crap, then be my guest go get this album, if not, come on over to the side of people with good taste, and do yourself a favor by buyin any cd buy: Daft punk, underworld, fluke, juno reactor, the orb, orbital, autechre, etc.Don't waste your money, it sucks!!"
1,Worked fine until cleaned,"Out of the box the product worked well for a few weeks.When our cleaning lady inadvertantly washed it with whatever cleaner she was using to clean the shower the mirror surface lost its ""magic"" -- now it fogs up quickly. Running a stream of hot water over the surface give momentary utility.Sure would like to know what to do to rejuvinate the surface and make it work again."
1,Talk about PIMPS . . .,"Why is this book being sold for almost $100 by those who have a used copy?! Those, I might add, who likely purchased it for $12. Is this NOT the greed that the book discusses? Don't pimp the public. Why should you earn almost $100 (less fees) for someone elses literary work? What hypocrisy!!"
1,They are inexpensive- now we know why,"The compasses were very inexpensive, so we were thrilled. We purchased 30 and have used about 12, of which 3 or 4 were unusable because the tightening nut is stripped out - in other words you can't tighten it to hold in any position. This makes the tool useless! I need to purchase more in the future- hopefully another brand."
2,"Great, but unexpected.","While ""Lover the Lord Has Left Us..."" is a great album in itself, it isn't a worthy follow-up to Tiger & The Duke, which is an absolute masterpiece. There are quite a few stand-out tracks, which include ""The Heretic"", ""My Horse Must Lose"", and ""Horses in the Sky"", but none of the tracks scratch the surface of what Tiger pulled off.We can only pray that TSOAF will work on another album and make it a bit closer to Tiger & The Duke."
2,Scale works,I bought this scale because I wanted a digital scale to replace my old dial scale that was difficult to accurately read. This new scale seems to be a good choice. It measures to the half a pound and seems to be accurate.
2,Protect your Macbook,"A friend of mine has this case in Red and it looked great, but I didn't want to make a statement, just wanted to protect my new MacBook Pro 17 inch beauty. So I picked up this case from Amazon.com and let me tell you, it's terrific. Fits like a glove and takes all the scuffs and scratches life brings it's way instead of the silvery smooth MBP itself.I highly recommend this simple, effective, shell style case. Available for MacBook and MacBook Pro in various sizes and colors."
2,Caribbean person's review of Black Jacobins,My interest the book was kindled by Michener's reference to it in his book 'THe Caribbean' which I only read recently.When I would see black people holding high office in the US army I would see it as evidence of the enlightened attitude of the American society. I now know that that 'enlightenment' wast the result of a lesson taught by Haitians since the 1790's.An excellent work which should be read by all especially Caribbean blacks!
2,This book is inspirational and practical.,"I judge this as the best book going for motivated people wishing to lose weight. I found the stories of ""plain folks"" to be highly inspirational. Their tips for losing, and especially, maintaining weight loss were immensely practical. I followed the Jump-Start diet and lost 5% of my body weight in six weeks. More importantly, I was able to modify the diet so I can follow it for a lifetime. I've never enjoyed ""dieting"" this much!"
2,Excellant!,"I has searched high and low to find a copy of ""Always"" on DVD and never found one. Finally decided to try ""Amazon"". I was very sceptical in purchasing an item from the internet for several reasons. first-payment. I was afraid that the card would get comprimized. And second, I thought the quality would be below average. But,I am thrilled with the quality of the DVD. I expected it to be like a priate copy and of poor quality, but it was't. It is crystal clear. Thanks! I will be purchasing again soon."
1,Cheap $0.99 Store Item,"The item arrived broken, so super glued it, as it was going to cost more for the return than the watch is worth. Bought the watch for $6.99 when it arrived the packaging had a price tag for $0.99. I put the watch on my sons wrist and it broke again, more each use. After, my son was upset, the watch kept braking. I ended up throwing it in the trash."
1,Terrible album.,"I wish I could give ""The Sounds of Ancient Fifes and Drums"" zero stars. Every piece is played in the same key. Ear piercing instruments with no substantial accompniament. The CD has fifty five tracks but I felt like I was hearing the same piece fifty five times. Very annoying and terrible CD."
2,Favorite Elizabeth I fiction,"Absolutely my favorite fictional recounting of Elizabeth's story. I especially appreciated the way the author didn't limit herself to Elizabeth's perspective, but also offered the perspectives of others in her life, including, to name just a few, her mother, Cecil, Dudley and Mary Queen of Scots. This created a much more well-developed character than I've seen elsewhere; a character whose actions good and bad are strongly influenced and explained by the vicissitudes of her childhood and young adulthood. So many historical novels romanticize their protagonists, creating a one-dimensional hero out of a real person. I've always thought that that creats a cognitive dissonance for the reader because there is no way to similarly gild the historical characters' less attractive deeds. This Elizabeth is a complex and realistic character who, while not sanitized, is still highly sympathetic."
2,Great Chinese Cookbook for beginners,"This was my first Chinese cookbook. I highly recommend this cookbook to the novice and intermediate Chinese cooks. The book contains many pictures and illustrations. Each recipe has its own photo, therefore, you have a sense of what the finished product should look like. The recipes are simple and very easy to follow. I have probably made every recipe in this book. The dishes turned out to be superb (even for a novice like me). I have since purchased many more cookbooks by this author. I have yet to be disappointed."
1,Order the bigger one,Cats were fascinated initially but it was too easy to reach their toys. Order the bigger one - cats need a challenge.
2,A Classic,"I am surprised movies like this are still being made today. The quality of the acting, directing, and (especially) the cinematography are excellent. The use of lighting, in particular, is first rate. I thought the choice of actors was also excellent, without exception. I'm very pleased to have seen this movie, and I will purchase it for my collection."
1,Just not cool.,"Other reviewers were generous. I respect that.I'm not much of a hater, but this product made me mad. I can't imagine the inventors actually film. The casters switch directions in the middle of a motion in any direction. I practiced over and over, and it kept doing the same thing.I didn't end up using it for quite a while after I bought it, for various reasons. After one use, realizing it was useless to me, I smashed it for some anger release. I will say it worked quite effectively for that purpose."
1,"No original theatrical editions, no sale","Sorry, Lucas, not this time. Never again. You had a chance to redeem yourself in the eyes of fans by including the original versions, remastered and in HD on this set, and once again you shun the people that made you rich in the first place. Well, not this time. Until the original versions are released, in remastered HD quality, you're not getting another penny of my money."
1,Hummm... Not too much,"I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best."
2,Hilarious,This film is a reality check for all those rock bands out there who take themselves SOOOOOOO seriously. Ha!Good on ya Rob Reiner!
2,The Magician's Nephew,"This book was nice and entertaining. The Naria book was about the begining of Naria, and how it came to be. This book is rated 4 stars, compared to my favorite Naria book: The lion, the witch and the wardrobe. I thought the book was nice, so I rated it 4 stars. I would recomend htis book to anybody who just likes to read, which is not me!"
2,My child sees herself in this book,"More families today look like ours -- an assortment, rather than a matching set -- but it's still rare enough to find a book that features a family like ours. Heart of Mine tells the story of a Vietnamese baby girl's adoption in perfect toddler/preschooler language. Every child's favorite story is her own story, and finding herself in a book like this means a lot to my daughter."
2,It's Christmastime and the family business is going up on the auction block,"Three generations of the Giorgio family have been in the lobster business in Brooklyn. When the bank that had their restaurant renovation loan went under, the FDIC insisted on immediate payment--if not the place goes up for auction.Oh yeah, and it's Christmas.It's a great tale of a long-time family that struggles and survives, keeping their fight, their ingenuity and their sense of humor."
2,fight the fat,I have never been overweight but i can say that i have struggled with weight loss and body image.This book is very funny and brutually honest everythingfrom clothes to sex. It is a must read if you dont want to read another diet book.
2,Good balance of cost and quality,"My Antec EA500 has worked fine for half a year. It is not the noisiest fan in my system, though not silent either. It is pretty heavy, which usually indicates high quality."
1,Worst Yet,"This product is the worst yet! If you are looking for a multi-functional toaster oven this is NOT it. The temperature is inconsistent, most foods I have tried to bake take twice as long and cook very uneven; burnt on the outside, raw in the middle. Toaster function usually dose not toast at all or burns to a crisp. Don't be fooled by the high price, you won't get your money's worth!"
1,Another rip-off.,"Just my opinion, but this appears to be another gimmick to sell books and get your 15 mins of fame. Like doctors and dentists are clueless. Didn't convince me of anything."
1,Red Sonja review,"It's bad but not as as bad as Arlond's other films. The fight scences are pretty solid & the settings are stylish. The best actor is the kid who played the prince. Some scences & quotes look and sound like a porno like ""Only women may touch it"" and ""She wants you for herself"". It also has plotholes like ""Why did'nt the Wizard kill Red Sonja when she was near him?"" The worst part of the movie is the robot sea monster. Where did they make that thing? Radioshack? I give this film a 3 out of 10."
1,No good vibrations for me?,"I only got 40 condoms. Most of them were flavored or ""extended pleasure,"" which do me no good. Also, instead of 2 vibrating rings, I got 0."
2,"Meeting Mr. Right or Thanks, Mom","ROMANCE AROUND THE CORNER is a clever little book that was given to me as a Christmas gift--by my mother! She read it, enjoyed it, and recommended it so highly that I just had to read it also. WOW!!! The author, Valerie Beck, practically takes your hand and walks you through the steps toward meeting Mr. Right. Anyone can follow this creative plan, including me--an overworked, single physician.Simply by improving my wardrobe and smiling more, I have improved my outlook on life, thanks to Ms Beck. Plus, by following her plan, I am actually dating again! (Perhaps the reviewer ""Sally"" should do more than read the Table of Contents and eat fewer sour grapes to improve HER outlook.)In conclusion, I give ""2 thumbs up"" to this cute, pink book and have purchased several for my single girlfriends-just $12.95 for the paperback!"
2,Decent Grill,"I really like this for jobs that won't fit in a cast-iron ""frying"" pan, so I don't have to make things in stages. But, like most cast-iron, you're going to need to season it to make it non-stick. I don't care what the description says above - this grill and all other cast-iron needs work to make it get that sheen and nice non-stick finish. I made chapatis first and it worked well, but I could see that this was going to take some uses (maybe 10 or so, with washing afterwards with hot water and steel wool, drying right away, and oiling all over) to be useful for pancakes and other items. I made tempeh today, and it came out great.The downside, besides the expected work with seasoning, is putting the item away. It's fairly large; I simply put it on its side, wrapped in parchment paper (to catch excess oil and not scratch my white cabinets), and put it in the cabinet."
2,Brilliant explanation of his love for god,Evander is a strong christian and in no other book is this as evident as this book.
2,Great,"This product may be old school, but really effective. All gophers gone in three days. Make sure you tie the end to a stake to make sure it doesn't go down the hole. Wear gloves to prevent the odor of your hands on the trap. Good hunting!"
1,Falling down,"As a huge fan of the series,I cannot say I'm pleased with this season. I just wanted to see what happened with Carter. The characters are weak,the storylines too. Very disapointed."
2,Squash History,Thoroughly enjoyed reading the background on the creation and evolution of the best sport in the world. Escapes me why it hasn't made it into the Olympics at this point (editorial comment on the state of sport in the world)!!!
2,Essential Penczak,"I've wanted this book since I first heard of it, and that's been about 4 or 5 years ago. I seriously did not expect this book to be so good - but then knowing what I know about Penczak, how could it be anything but fabulous?Yes, there is some basic Wicca stuff in it that most of us seasoned readers on the subject are already familiar with. However, there is more material here than I thought there would be geared towards the gay Witch/Pagan.And this book fits my path, my thoughts, my practice, and gives me more depths into which to dive headlong.Thank you, Chris, for this awesome work."
1,Not worthy of the name of Maeve Binchy!,"This has got to be the most stupid movie I've seen in a long time. The fact that Maeve Binchy wrote a book with this name (that this movie is ""adapted"" from) is the only reason I bought this in the first place. I watched the VHS version tonight - 2 volumes, and was less than 2 hours in length. The dialogue was jerky, disjointed, and somehow didn't ""go"" with the picture at all. Music was occasionally inserted, but almost as an afterthought. Things just weren't ""right"" with this movie! It was so bad, I can't even describe what I disliked about it. I wouldn't advise buying this movie, but you have to watch it to see what I'm talking about!"
2,A Great Movie All Around!!,"This is the best romantic comedy I know. It's realistic and very light hearted. The DVD does not have great features, but the basics are there and the movie is good enough to overcome what the DVD lacks. Worth the buy."
2,Winning The Affiliate Game,"Using just a few of the principles found in this book is helping me turn my sites into cash generators instead of just static sites hoping someone will stop by. Thanks Declan for providing information that truly helps the average, everyday person become successful in this awesome frontier called the Internet."
1,What the?,"I'm trying hard to read this book but the characters are so stupidly implausible that I don't know if I can bother to continue.We have the typical rich, handsome tycoon who runs into (literally) the typical gorgeous woman in a hotel hallway. The minute he sees her he starts begging her to marry him. Oh, shut up! He talks her into having a drink, then spends the whole evening getting drunk (trying to impress her) while simultaneously begging her to marry him. When he wakes up the next morning (in her apartment), he immediately begins begging her to marry him again. She's so amused and continues to play hard to get, and I'm so bored out of my mind at this point that I can't believe I paid for this!Good luck."
2,MR.SPATS CAT a COMB,"Over the years I continue to purchase Mr.Spats Cat a Comb, and over the years I continue to have one Major criticism of this otherwise ""unique""and ""most worthwhile product"". THE VELCRO!!! This company should definitely change their Velcro to ""INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH"" Velcro, since the Velcro they enclose with the product is good for nothing. Their Velcro eventually pulls away from the wall or wherever it is placed, causing a half-on the wall - half-off the wall Cat a Comb. I purchaed some industrial strength velcro, removed the pads that come with the wall comb, and now everybody is happy...especially my fur-babies. D-CAT-LOVER"
1,Lousy DVD,"The season one dvd was not 16x9, does not have closed captions, nor did not allow selection of chapters (scenes). In summary, it has the technical status of pre-1990's collections. Even the MacGyver dvds were more sophisticated. I am especially perturbed that they claim to be closed-captioned, because I need the captioning. Before some ignorant wag recommends that I simply turn up the volume ... how effective is shouting at a deaf person?"
1,NOT VERY GOOD,THIS IS SOME WHAT CHARMING BUT THE MOVIES SEEMS TO BE ONE BIG TRAGEDY AFTER THE NEXT.THE THE LAST MINS ARE TOTALY UNFUNNY SLAPSTICK.ALSO WAS WAS JAMES CROWELL NOT IN THE MOVIE MORE HE WAS PART OF THE MAGIC OF THE FRIST ONE.I WAS VERY DISSAPIONTED WITH THIS.
2,Great Bible Study Book,Our D-Group read this book over the summer. Very good book and Lundgaard did a great job at bringing to my attention things I was oblivious to.
1,Buy this for Ms. Kenyon's story,I should know better by now than to buy this type of book--3 stories by authors with a similar theme. Ms. Kenyon is an automatic purchase for me and i did enjoy her story the most. The other 2 just did not hold my interest...I had not read anything by either author before. Be forewarned.....
2,Love it,"For once, the critics are right on. If you love either ""Harvest"", ""Harvest Moon"", or both, you owe it to yourself to pick up ""Silver & Gold"". It's Neil and his harmonica at his acoustic best with flavors of bluegrass and country occasionally thrown in. This is the follow-up to ""Harvest Moon"" I hoped for back in '92. I'll take it and love it a decade later."
1,Magellan Explorist with no company support,"The magellan company has probably the worst customer service of any company on the planet. I bought an Explorist XL several years ago and still the company has not put out the DVD map software for it. I still have no street maps for it. If you call them they lie to you about a release date. Every time I called they would tell me it would be available in 6 weeks. They did this for a year. The story then changed to ""It would be available as a download at their web site"". That was also over a year ago. Bottom line:They sold me a gps that would never have the proper software for driving.If you e-mail them you only get an automatically generated response that tells you to call them. I finally quit calling. I do not like being lied to.My advice: Buy a Garmin or a Tom Tom. Magellan does not care about their customers. Guy"
2,Excellent,"O ítem é excelente, muito útil, prático e um designe avanado... Muito boa compra... Gostei muito... Compraria novamente se necessário..."
2,Excellent but exhausting,"The paperback is bound to be a lot less awkward and unwieldy. But the used copies of the hardbound are dirt cheap. I bought the hardbound.Each of the selections are very short, dramatic and intense. I found it hard to read more than a couple of them at a sitting.Of course the selection is skewed to include a lot of British explorers.The inclusion of a number of anecdotes about the deaths of explorers, usually either by starvation of hostile natives, got tiresome. You really got the feeling you were being sold martyrdom stories, that these guys were martyrs for civilization.But apart from these minor criticisms, this is an outstanding collection and many of the selections make you want to go and find the full versions of the original sources. I did this with respect to Rene Caillie's Timbuctoo journey, for example. Many of the sources are out of print, but they can be found for free in PDF form on Google Books and other archive sites."
2,Good to go!,"The shipping was quick, the package arived in good condition, and everything was just as advertised. These are a great sized single use individualy packaged unit, perfect for adding to your custom tailored FAKs(First Aid Kits)...You can, and should always build a kit to suit your needs better than the large mass marketed kits which generally tend to be filled with nonessential cheap filler items like small bandaids and sanitising wipes. Those and similar items can often be easily improvised if need be, and those type kits really should be marketed as ""boo-boo"" or ""snivel"" kits, as opposed to First Aid Kits. A firsst Aid Kit, in my humble opinion should be heavy on over the counter mediciness, decent large wound dressings, and other essential Aid items...One good solution is to buy one of many small basic kits and add to them, these make a great addition!.."
1,Gosh.,"I'm glad I got this vid from the library because it would be horrible if I had spent money on it. The cueing is horrible, and downright frustrating. I turned this off and put P90x Cardio X back on."
1,Not a new book!!,"I was so very disappointed to receive this, only to find that it is only a collection of the first 3 books in the series!I love this series, and I was so happy to see a new title that I ordered this as soon as it came out. I should have waited for a review to see what was really happening. I'll do that with the Brightwell books from now on.Other authors publish collections, but you always know from the titles that they are collections. I was tricked into thinking this was a new story because of the title.Don't order this book unless you really want the collection of her first 3 books! I'd give 0 stars if I could - because of the misleading title."
1,CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer who thought this was ""awful, awful, awful."" Why Lou, why??? His voice has never sounded creakier/weaker. The instrumentation is amateurish. The whole concept is trite to the point of comedy. It's like Spinal Tap doing a tribute to Stonehenge."
2,Panasonic Pore Cleanser works well,I recently purchased this pore cleanser mainly for my 14 yr old to use since she has a problem with blackheads. I decided to try it out first so I could show her how to use it properly. I was disgusted yet fascinated by the amount of goo it sucked off my face. My daughter had a similar experience. Both our noses looked better the next morning. Her blackhead count was visibly lessened. The only suggestion I would have for panasonic is to figure out a way to make the mist warm water. It seems counterproductive to me to spray cold water on the face thus closing the very pores you are trying to clean. The mist is also a little messy but I understand why it is necessary. I would say that this is worth the money and you should give it a try.
1,Big Mistake,Ouch! This chair was a surprise for my husband who had back surgery 10 years ago. The hope was that the massage would be comforting - not so. The massages were so rough that we were literally pushed up from the chair. Imagine yourself laying down on your back in a hammock. Now imagine someone below you jamming their knees so far up your back that your head leaves the hammock. I think this is an item that should be tested in person and then purchased online.
1,Groucho was right!,"Save your money and for sure don't buy this book! The only funny thing stated in this book was from Groucho Marx. He said, ""From the moment I picked your book up until I laid it down I was convulsed with laughter. Someday I intend reading it."" In respect for Groucho, I would have this to say to him, I read the book and there was nothing funny or laughable except for your quote."
2,I really liked this car game,"This game was the perfect car game for a guy like me. There are lots of varity in the types of racing (though some times the stunt levels where very difficult). The garage/purchase upgrades and decals really spoke to the RPG'er in me. It is exciting to build such a personal, cool looking car. I also loved that I could hop into the game, play for 30 mins and get out again. My 4 year loved to watch me play it (he loves cars and the graphics are really good). Overall, its a really good game and, for the price, it beats any of the other $60+ car games I have purchased - hands down."
2,awesome disk,"I can only second the previous review. I'd buy one again even if a little more expensive than other drives. the built in cable is neat, and there is no compatibility trouble whatsoever with my G4 powerbook. usb drives sometimes would give trouble with waking up from sleep and require an extra Y cable to get power from both usb ports. ps apricorn supplies this cable if you buy the usb drive."
1,it's not worth reading,"There are a lot of one and two star reviews about Eragon. They seem to fall into 3 categories:1. The fantasy fans who have read other fantasy books or watched fantasy movies and therefore know that Eragon is a rip-off and they are not happy about it.2. The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke. Well, all the characters are, but especially the females.I think if you buy it you'll probably regret it. Take it out from the library and see what you think because it's quite possible you'll hate it."
2,Mandy is wonderful,THIS IS A ONE OF GODS GIFTSTO US. WE ALL SHOULD THANK HIMEVERY DAY. MANDY IS ONE HELL OF SINGER AND WE ALL SHOULD KISS THE GROUND SHE WALKS ON.WE SHULD ALL BEG TO LISTEN TOHER SING. IM SURE EVERYONESREAD EACH OF HER CUSTOMERREVIEWS. IN MY VOTE THEY DONTKNOW JACK ABOUT HER.
2,Functional and Value For Money,"Due to my employment I travel extencively, this time piece has in the short time I have owned it forefilled all the requirements I require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. I would recommend Pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. At this moment in time I have 4 Pulsar time pieces that I use on a regular basis, 3 are working /daily use sports watches and I have a dress watch for when I am entertaining / partying. None of these watches have ever let me down, I have them regularly, serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed, regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. My one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast, however it remains an excellent time piece - Highly recommended"
1,Could have been a lot better,"Soulmates Dissipate was truly disappointing. Jada and Wellington spend no time getting to know each other before they were in the sack. What made them soulmates, well we never really find out. The love scenes were scorching and well-written, but other than that there wasn't much to Jada or Wellington. And I don't no any woman who is foolish enough to let another woman stay in the same house with her ""man"". Also, two intelligent people like Jada and Wellington should have been able to figure out much earlier in this book that they were both played for fools. I am so turned off by this one, I won't bother to read the sequel."
2,Very entertaining,"I really liked this book, it was a mystery/crime type of story and the characters were very entertaining. When the book started I thought that the police in charge of the investigation was going to be the lead character, but he wasn't. The lead character, a newspaper reporter, was smart and sexy and funny. The book had a few twists and turns that were unexpected, so it wasn't a book that you could predict the end by the time you were half was through. It was a very enjoyable read."
1,Contains Artificial Flavors!,"After trying this tea at a friend's house I was smitten, so I immediately went home and ordered from Amazon. The written description clearly states that there are no artificial flavors in it, so imagine my disappointment when I received the tea which does indeed have artificial flavors in it!! To Amazon's credit they refunded my money immediately (there are no returns in the grocery department). However, I would have rather saved myself the hassle of placing the order at all had I know that it contained artificial flavors."
2,Solid product. Great accuracy and sensitivity.,"I've used the natural keyboard for 5+ years. All comments assume you are accustomed to the natural feeling.Keyboard. Sensitivity and feeling of the keys is very fluid. There is pressure without that hard feeling on your finger tips. Very comfortable. For a wireless keyboard, accuracy is right on. I use it within a couple feet of the wireless base and can't speak to how far away it works with 100% accuracy. Hot keys for MS products are great. If you are XP, you'll love the quick access to all your programs, files, and functions.Mouse. Sensitivity and feeling is great. Accuracy is on too. The mouse is slightly bigger than some other units out there. I am 6' tall with relatively large hands and this is comfortable. It may be big for smaller people, but it is a matter of what you are accustomed to. Scrolling is very fluid and controllable.All in all, solid product. Would recommend."
1,The 2nd best child molesting musician of all time,"Apparently child molestation does not deter other musical artists from collaborating with R. Kelly. Aside from his fascination for underage girls, his lyrics express the same emotional depth of an Adam Sandler song."
2,Good for a new-enter in this field!,"I think this book is quite a good overview on the modern financial subject. I myself am not a finance people but can grasp some ideas based on thier mathematic equivalent to my field study. [Brownian Motion, Stochastic Process, Random Walk etc.] It's amazing for me to link my background in Polymer Science to this new area quite well. [I observed that there is a new area called 'Econophysics'.. perhaps I am the people in this caterogy]Visit Vao-soongnern, Nakhonratchasima, Thailand"
2,Very nice watch,"My bride-to-be love Movado watches, but the somewhat exaggerated ""pop art"" style of this one was a little different for her. She got used to it quickly though, and it is now one of her favorites. Link removal is not as simple as most Movados due to the large size of the links. Their removal--especially if it's an odd number of links that needs to be removed--can create an unbalanced band. That happened to be the case for us, but the way it sits on my B2B's wrist, it works."
1,Broke after a month,The Martin Yale automatic letter opener machine lasted about a month before it broke and stopped working. It certainly isn't very reliable.
2,Neanderthal Man,"I gave one to my 14 yr. old grandson who has AD/HD. He loves to take things apart and usually keeps me on edge when he comes for a visit. However, this toy kept him and a friend busy and interested for a couple of hours digging out the bones. They had a great time and did well in finding all the bones and putting them together. It was somewhat messy, but easy to clean up afterward."
2,"Pretty darn good, but...","Syncing with my Treo happens about 95% on the first try, and the remainder get done on the second try. Sound quality & clarity is good, even in moderately noisy locations. Folks at the other end are surprised at the sound quality. It feels a bit lumpy on your ear at first, but after about a minute you forget it's there (unless you try to put on glasses). Battery life is decent, but without some sort of meter it's prudent to keep it on the charger between uses."
1,WAKE UP MOTHRA!!!!!!!!,"GODZILLA IS AFTER THE BAD GUYS INCLUDING A GIANT LOBSTER WITH ONE BIG CLAW AND AN ANNOYING SCREECH. HOWEVER HIS SCREECH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE VOICE OF ONE OF THE DUBBED ACTORS WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A BUNCH OF CATS CAUGHT IN A LAWNMOWER. MOTHRA SLEEPS THROUGH THE ENTIRE MOVIE UNTIL THE VERY END WHEN HE RESCUES THE NATIVES FROM THE ISLAND WHICH IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE. MOTHRA MUST HAVE BEEN IN A COMA SINCE THE NATIVES OF INFANT ISLAND DID NOTHING BUT SING AND DANCE UNTIL MOTHRA AWOKE.DURING THE ATTACK BY THE AIRFORCE OF THE RED BAMBOO (THE BAD GUYS), GODZILLA DANCED WHILE DESTROYING THE JET FIGHTERS. HE ALSO PLAYED BASEBALL WITH EBIRAH, THE LOBSTER ON STEROIDS.THE MOVIE WAS KIND OF SILLY BUT STILL ENJOYABLE. ALL IN ALL, THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER GODZILLA MOVIES WHICH ARE BETTER THAN THIS ONE."
2,"Love, love, love these towels","After purchasing a smaller size for a trip to Africa, I bought these larger ones as a gift for an avid camper/canoeist. They are wonderful to use because they take up so little space and dry very quickly."
2,Excellent overview of destructive behavior in children,As a paremt of three sons and a member of TOUGHLOVE this book was a welcome addition to our weekly parent support meetings. All the parents in attendance agreed that Dr. Samenow has given an insight into antisocial children that has been long overlooked.
2,Most fun I've ever had!,"OMG! This game has me hooked on it for hours! In a previous barn I had over 56 mill.! I play this game for hours trying to make the perfect horse (20 on all stats!)! I just wish the barn was soooooooo much bigger! I can't live w/ only 6 horses! Thanks for the great racing game!KatyPS. Maybe you should remake it, and make the barn muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch bigger (like 100 stalls! :D:D:D:p)! lol :D:p"
2,a must read!,Super mix of action and adventure in Africa. Bull can write like the wind. Really flows well from action to dialogue. I like all his stuff. Check out Devil's Oasis!
2,If you like this book...,"If you like this book, you may also enjoy the bookFalse Memoryby Dean Koontz. Both are very well written and I enjoyed the many plot twists and the suspense."
1,Only good part is the extra,"Hard to understand how one can take a beautiful location and ruin it with poor photography. The color is all a greenish-yellow and looks awful. The only thing worth watching is the extra which probably was recorded with a low cost HD camcorder and looks much better than the feature. It has natural color, good skin tone and even most of the people in the film look better on the short extra. McConnaughey acts like a stoned idiot in the freature, but has charm and class in the extra. Whoever did the extra should have been responsible for the entire film."
1,Bigger is not always better,"As a long time TMBG fan, I was seriously dissappointed with this album. It made me cry :-( The quirky instrumentation was missing :/ It was the beginning of the end of TMBG. How I long for the days of Lincoln."
1,At A Glance DayMinder Weekly Appt Book,"Disappointing. The product delivered was not as pictured. The picture clearly shows alphabetical tabs for the Phone/Address section. As delivered there were only 4 two column pages, wide column for ""Names and Adresses"" and a narrower column for ""Telephone"". There was no alphabetical organization, no alphabetical tabs (as pictured) and no organization on the page for name, address, city, state, zip. Only the hassel of return including cost of return postagae prevented its return. Will not order similar products from Amazon in the future."
2,Very Good detangler!,"If you're looking for a DAILY conditioner (not a deep moisturing conditioner) this is a good one and fairly priced. A little goes a long way! My daughter and I both have long hair, and Terax does a great job of detailing our hair in the shower so that we're not pulling it out at the roots when brushing or styling."
2,"Comfort Kleenex, like Comfort Food for your nose!",I keep Kleenex Menthol ColdCare Tissues on hand for cold and allergy season. The menthol really helps get through those miserable sneezing fits!Kleenex Menthol Tissues take me back to my childhood when menthol rubs were a part of cold care. I call them Comfort Kleenex because they are like comfort food for my nose!
2,"Don't like Doc, Love Doc Martin","Doc Martin: Collection - Series 1-4Great Series. Clever writing, believable acting and good plot twists, all in a gorgeous setting in England."
1,Just a big headache!,"Sounds like it has a lot of features for the money. It would be great if it worked. After 15 minutes of filming, it says the heads need cleaned, it won't record and the 15 minutes I did manage to get playback at such an awful quality, it isn't worth watching. The 800 number for service is a joke and the nearest ""authorized service center"" is listed as 954 miles from me. You don't even get close to what you pay for with this one!"
2,Nerdy Delight,"Look, if you're in the market for D&D books this bundle is the best thing since fireball for a mage. The box it comes in is durable and cool looking. The books are exactly what you'd expect them to be... if you don't know what they are already there's really now way to describe them."
2,Simon and Friend,I was very happy to be able to get another copy of this to give fore a Christmas present
2,Relaxing Music,"This is one of the finest Audio CD's by the great Jimmy Dorsey. It is good as background music for that special dinner, or a cocktail party evening at sunset time with friends....the time the ice-cubes begins to clink. Whenever I play it for friends, there is always great appreciation. Those in the forties and over age grouping can relax to this one. So Rare, Tangerine, Amapola and Yours, are all typical favourites. Five Stars, and highly recommended.Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar 15/11/08"
1,Indie's Biggest Hits Volume 1??,"A greedy corporation's attempt to cash in on Indie Rock Music. This gets one star for the fact that they would even market this similar to ""NOW that's what I call music. This music deserves a better outlet."
2,Great so far...,"I bought this little extension cord for a Medialink Bluetooth dongle so I wouldn't have to pull the tiny little thing out every time I put my laptop in its bag - it's much easier to just leave the Bluetooth attached to this cable and yank the cable out instead. It works just perfectly for this purpose; however, as others have noted, the cable I received was not like the one pictured (the pictures with the completely sheathed female end). I don't see it as too big of a deal, but the picture really should be updated so people will know exactly what they're getting.So far the product works perfectly - both the male and female ends have a good tight fit; but if I run into a problem down the road I'll update this review."
1,dont buy,"I just go this thing in the mail and assembled it, defintely not worth the money. This thing should be sold for 5 dollars, its really flimbsy and cheap. The color is very lighter and different than the picture shown and a couple of the screw holes were missing. also the $22 for shipping didn't help any. Wait and spend more money on something nicer that will last."
2,"Great, wish I was in better shape..","After reviewing dozens of other exercise balls, this one seemed the best. So far there has been no problems mentioned on other ones. Fairly easy to blow up. Nice and sturdy. No ""sticky"" problems. No leakage. Doesn't feel weak and cheap. Mainly used by my wife who is very active and fit. Enjoys it very much.Price was great too."
2,A Treasure,"I cannot see myself tiring of this book.It is a collection of essays that explore the relationship of God and man. I plan to use it as a reference and a devotional, which means that it will probably remain nearby.It is full of wonderous insights."
2,NOT near your PC,I was extremely displeased with this purchase. So much static I could barely hear what was going on ...BUT!!!! after I plugged the receptor in an outlet AWAY from my Pc ...IT works PERFECTLY...GREAT PURCHASE...Just keep away from COMPUTER!!!
1,GARBAGE,Do not buy this item! It broke apart with 1 small blanket hanging on it after extremely gentle use. It was like a scene out of a Chevy Chase movie. I could not decide if I wanted to laugh or cry. It is cheap and not worth the money.
1,Reluctant Rental,"It should be noted that Shining Force Neo is not an RPG, but a real time action adventure game. There is a lot of timing and button mashing to defeat hordes of monsters over and over again. There are countless long, boring cutscene style dialogs between the characters, and a less than interesting storyline. On the plus side, the music is not bad and the graphics are acceptable. There are also special abilities thrown into the combat which make it a little more fun than if it were a pure beat 'em up such as Dynasty Warriors. However, the item system is very convoluted and frustrating to understand; it is not intuitive. If you prefer real time action adventure type games to RPG and turn based strategy games, you might want to give this game a go, otherwise I would have to recommend avoiding this one unless someone is letting you borrow it for free."
2,Marcus Miller: Master of All Trades,I'm a huge Marcus Miller fan so take it with a grain of salt but this is an outstanding performance. The Audio quality is better than the earlier concert CD. Plus since the promoters and halfwits at the radio stations here in Chicago always trot out the same tired acts its nice to imagine I'm at a Marcus Miller show.
2,Must read,"I just completed this book which I did with my Bible study group as a group study. It is one of the best studies we have done. This is a great book for any Christian or really for anyone - the judgment seat is not a topic often covered in church. For individual or group study, it is definitely a must read."
1,Not sure why it got such a good rating,"Not sure why it got such a good rating. Acting was really bad, didn't finish watching the movie. Why did it get 4 starts?"
1,"Too Short for ""Pet Smart"" Brand Flap Replacement","About 3/16"" too short as replacement for my Pet Smart patio pet door. With skill you can trim off the bottom 1/2 of the placement tabs and it will be a fair, but not perfect fit. The measurements given were accurate, but in belief of other review adn websites claiming ""never mind the dimensions--it will work in Pet Smart door also"" I bought one. Shipping was almost instantaneous."
2,Nada mal para ser salsa!,"A pesar de que a mi no me gusta la salsa, creo que los dos discos de éxitos del rey son buenos y ciertamente los únicos que me han gustado de este género, por lo que lo recomiendo a todos, y más a los amantes del rey ruiz. No está nada mal para ser salsa!"
2,Sowell is the soul of our time,"This book has only gained by the passage of time since it was written. It is clear that his analysis of the huge separation between those who view man as ""constrained"" vs the modern Liberal viewpoint has only grown deeper. He actually makes the best case I have read for the Liberal position, and it is still sorely lacking. I am so grateful that he lives and writes."
1,The Dangers Of Awful Research Is More Accurate,"I'm afraid Mr. Pribbenow is right; I wasted my money on this one.According to this book, CIA hasn't done a thing right since 1947, which would be fine, if the book were entitled, ""CIA Hasn't Done A Thing Right Since 1947"" or if the reader decides to make peace with the premise, ok, it's nothing but the bad stuff; plow ahead anyway.But when Mr. Trento attempts to address the assassination of President Kennedy by framing it as a Soviet operation via Cuba, I realized the facts presented here are so contrary to the evidence it became impossible for me to read anything further. It couldn't be worse if his history of CIA included Columbus' arriving in New York aboard a nuclear submarine in 1492.I have a half-read book. Save your money and time, read anything else."
1,"Thinner, more expensive but still maintain its so-so quality","I have a chance to read this new edition of the Genes. It is obviously thinner than the previous edition. The materials presented are roughly the same with some new figures (most of them crystal structure). The drawing figures shown throughout the text are still pretty poor and ugly. They are somehow difficult to understand. The references given are not very up-to-date and most of them come from ""Cell"" where the author himself is the editor. Well, generally this edition is little bit better than the previous edition in term of modern idea of the field but not that obvious. Try the new edition of Lodish et al., you will see the difference."
2,where can i find,Does anyone know where i can find the first song played in the movie the one i think is called bt- ovie remix theme.
1,Apple Sync/Charge USB Cable.,"These cords were not produced by Apple. The packaging states they are SF Planet. The cord will not work on an older computer it totally blanks it out everytime we plug it in. It does work on the new laptop, but it seems to slow it down a bit."
2,Do You Like Apples?,"Enjoyable and captivating.It's the story of how a group of roughian Boston South-side-of-towners (""Southies"") live, and how one of the group (Matt Damon) seems to have a supernatural ability to solve math problems, absorb information from text books and interpret the info his own way. This ability is noticed by a math professor who attempts to cultivate Damon's character into a professional that uses the ability to succeed in government or business.A psychiatrist is brought in to help tailor Damon into a more personable character, and a struggle ensues between the professor, the psychiatrist and Damon himself on what direction Damon's life should go in.Ultimately very well done, and definitely NOT A CHICK-FLICK.Not my kind of purchase, but definitely worth renting.How do you like them apples?"
1,Waste Of Money!,"This book didn't teach me anything that I didn't know already. I learnt a lot more by playing around with the software. It doesn't even teach you how to do impressive special effects, like montages or TV lines.If you have already played around with Photoshop, then you don't need this book! There are better tutorials out there on the internet and they are free!Save your money!!!"
1,"Enough about ""ME"" - why not help the world?","Just think of all the tangible good that could be done in the world with all the millions upon millions of dollars the authors of The Secret are making through the book, the DVD, the CD, the speaking gigs etc. etc. Why, there would be millions up millions of dollars to help build wells in Africa, help those with Aids, find cures for diseases, eliminate homelessnesss....Not to mention, if every person who plunks down $20 -50 for the Secret also got out of the ""me"" syndrome and started to think about others.The Secret is no secret. It appeals to our society who believes happiness is found by getting what we want all the time. Life isn't easy, and some of my greatest life lessons have been learned when I have faced challenges and struggles. I believe the real secret to joy and contentment is to turn our attention off of ourselves once in awhile and use that energy and those resources to love and help others."
1,Interesting but not complete,The author apparently has not adequately appreciated that (1) computers were not invented but gradually and continuously evolved since the first: the abacus; and that (2) the following two books should have deserved more attention: (2.1) Herman H.Goldstine: THE COMPUTER FROM PASCAL TO [JOHN] VON NEUMANN (1993); and (2.2) William Aspray: JOHN VON NEUMANN AND THE ORIGINS OF MODERN COMPUTING (1992).
1,why iv don't like the chager because...,I hate it because it looks terble. also the cable it comes with it dosen'nt. fit in the ipod this why i do not like this.
1,Does NOT work with Windows Vista!,"I had to send this item back because it does not work with Windows Vista. The website may say that, but I haven't seen it. The mouse ""works,"" but it somehow alters the computer to where you cannot change the mouse settings... and that was after I'd installed the cd!"
1,Cuff problem,"I am a slender woman 115lbs., the spring cuff is difficult to hold tightly enough to secure a fit capable of reading my blood pressure taking it on my own. IT IS A STRUGGLE TO TAKE ON MY OWN, the loose cuff is the only way for me to secure a tight enough fit to take my blood preesure, not this SPRING CUFF. Seriously, for all you single slim people this is not the cuff for you & I have tried to find the old model cuff for this model unit & CANNOT; I do not think they make a different cuff for this unit. One might as well throw the $100 & some $'s away if one is a small individual. Your blood pressure will only increase while attempting to take!"
1,No more shopping from Allergy Be Gone,"The filters I received were BestAir HW500 (1 of 4 was in the original box). They have a metal shell versus plastic on the original Honeywell HAC504. I returned them and received another set of filters which were again the same filters(HW500) I believe. They had no original box and the shell was metal, which can easily scratch its housing and stimulate mold growth in humidifier.It is also sad that I saw another review sent on October 2007 about similar problem(purchased as HAC504, received different) for the same item purchased from Allergy Be Gone."
2,"The beginning is great, the end gets a bit dull","TLC has now better songs than ever before. Hypnotic highlights like ""FanMail"", ""Silly Ho"" and ""Unpretty"" help to accept the fact that there are also some run-of-the-mill moments like ""Come On Down"". Technically, as always, their work is great."
2,"Good, bad (and ugly?)","As an amature artist, I picked this up to provide some instruction in drawing the human figure. The first quarter of the book (dealing with the face and facial features) didn't impress me. Too cartoonish for my taste, frankly. However, the following sections - especially on proportion and foreshortening, perspective, and negative space were extremely helpful. The book is not without its faults, but overall I have found it instructive."
1,Wrong color received,Everything was fine until my step daughter opened the package and found the item to be white. Since everything in her kitchen was black this was a catastrophy. I gave her the keys to my car and she went to four coffee shops and finally changed it for a black one. I don't want her to go through that again.George Butcher
2,Five Stars Is Not Enough,"'Dusk And Her Embrace' is already a classic album. Every song is CoF doing what they do best, which is black metal done right. Excellent. BUT, when you throw in a SLAYER cover, hide behind something big and hope that Hell itself doesn't swallow you whole. Cradle's cover of 'Hell Awaits' is a magnificient display of pure metal mastery by Dani and the boys, and is alone worth the price of the album. Adding a twist of European sophistication to pure American violence, 'Hell Awaits' becomes a lesson in brutality that only CoF can teach. If you don't already have this album, GET IT NOW."
2,Kentucky Rich,"very good read. Very intresting story line. I love Fern Michael's novels, from the sisterhood and Godmothers, plus all of her independent novels"
1,"Good Book, Old Format","I actually couldn't get myself to read this one because the text was just so small and the book was so thick and it seemed much too daunting. I want to get it in a different form so that I can read it, because I'm sure it's one I will like, I just couldn't do it with this one--and I'm a big reader."
1,Very disappointed!,"I was very disappointed in this book. It was so old that the pages were all yellowed at the edges. I bought used, so I guess that part is acceptable, but it was copyrighted 1989 not 1992 like the listing said.The information in it makes no mention of anything from the viewpoint of anything electronic. I am afraid that the information is probably so outdated that it will be of little use to me. Should have dug deeper instead of being sucked in by the title; my fault. Just be warned...get something more recently published so you don't waste your money or time. I learned my lesson. Won't happen again!"
1,A waste of time,This book reputes itself to tell the secret history of British media baron Mr. Maxwell. A better account and although a work of fiction a more plausible account can be found in Mr. Archers `The fourth of Estate'. Maxwell had connections with Israels Mossad and he did have many high level contacts in Israel and he was involved in dubious behavior with the Russians but this book goes one step to far and simply creates relationships that did not exist. Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad. In fact Maxwell simply failed in business and probably committed suicide. This is an interesting account but should be read with an eye of suspicion.
2,A lighter side of Clint,"A suprisingly funny movie from the usually serious actor Clint Eastwood. A good combination of comedy, action and romance. This one appeals to men, women and kids alike."
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought this book based on the description on the back cover. That was the most interesting page in the book. This is an amatuer writing job. Predictable would be a improvement. It had an interesting premise to begin with, however, the ""standoff"" did not have the plot twists and turns described. It was really all about two misguided teens who ran off to be together and save their baby from the girl's domineering father. They were both selflish and unlikable for their irresponsible actions, however it was clear that the author wanted us to see them in a Romeo and Juliet kind of way. The adults were not much better, by being supportive of these two teens rather than showing adult wisdom (i.e., Doc returning the gun to the boy as a show of support). The romance between ""Doc"" and Tiel McCoy was even more contrived. I could see where that was going the minute the ""Marlboro Man"" met the ""slender blonde"" in the convenience store. Boring, badly written book. Save your time and money."
2,A Must Have. Reuben is awsome!,I love Reuben's single Flying without wings & Superstar. They are both great song selections and Reuben does a fantastic job. I listen to his cd everday. I can't wait for his album. I know it will be awsome!
1,Do NOT buy this book!,"This slim volume is mostly white space and very large type. None of the information in this little booklet is particularly helpful nor illuminating and it should have all been included with the application anyway.Buying this dumb little ""book"" will only reinforce your frustration with Aperture and your distaste for Apple.Don't do it.david boise ID"
2,A good reference for all parents,"This book is a homeschooling 'must have', yet, I found Charlotte Mason Summaries to be a good source of information not only regarding schooling, but in child rearing as well. It is a good source of information for all parents, even if they aren't homeschooling. The way the book is summarized, it is very easy to understand. I would recommend this book not just for a homeschool parent but for any parent."
1,Not worth much,"Since it is an ""Atkins"" book, it would have been wise to show ""fiber"" carbs, since this would have allowed the reader to subtract this to arrive at ""net"" carbs. It doesn't. Really unbelievable."
1,Possession,"She needs to stick to her true crime books. I am a fan of hers. I would recommend Rule's true crime books, but not this one."
2,Online Purchase was Excellent,"The recent purchase of a pair of Rockport Men's Evander shoes through Amazon (Heart & Sole) was the perfect online shopping experience. From the immediate email communications from the moment of purchase to the dispatch of the shoes and surprise of quick receipt of same, I could not fault the service."
2,G'Day! G'Day!,"Great selection of songs, Mate. Disapointed that ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport"" was only instrumental. Other wise very happy."
2,Remake?,"Lot's of action in what has to be a remake of The Quick and the Dead. It has got the Priest, the kid, the girl and the grizzly old man. Ok, it has the modern day twist, but still everyone must die except for one. Maybe."
1,FADED,so supposedly this item is new but the one i recieved looked very used. very dissappointed not the dark pretty purple color like in the picture. don't buy for a gift like i did.
2,Perfect storage for your Japanese knives!,"No one ends up with just a couple of good Japanese Kitchen knives. I had just bought several expensive knives and my old block just wouldn't fit the larger blades of the Japanese knives. This one was made for the wider knives. Mine holds a couple of gyutos, a Banno Bunka, Nakiri, 2 pettys, and I measured it and it will house my new Hiromoto Sujihiki slicer, the longest one.I like the slanted angle and the arrangement of the slots makes for easy entry and removal without other knives gettng in the way.Good price at about $60 as I believe it sold for about $90, although I dont think I would buy it at that price.The best feature is that it will hold 4 WIDE CHEF type knives....most others don'tAnd the HORIZONTAL layout is easier on the blades...won't dull them.The other one I have is vertical and the blade road cuts against the block when you withdraw the knife."
1,Don't buy this software,"I would echo what other reviewers have said about this product. Once I upgraded to XP it stopped working completely. I couldn't uninstall it, nor could I get it to work properly. I also had to go into my registry to finally [remove] the darn thing. This was very frustrating, don't make the same mistae I did - AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
1,scary,this has to be the worst single EVER and ally and aj are the worst singers ever and i thought raven was bad thing is all these disney singers are terrible and now they are getting an albulm?????????????????????????????????????crazy
1,Did not work,It did not stand up to the heat and it really didn't work at flipping eggs over. Plus egg struck to it and I had to scrap it to clean it. It will probably end up in the garbage.
1,"A liitle old, don't ya thinK??","Wow, this book is very old and the directions and discriptions are hard to understand!! Need a more modern book of Twirling!!"
2,A good basic MP3 player,"The SanDisk Sansa M260 is the highest capacity (4 GB) flash-memory based MP3 player currently available that takes standard AAA batteries. I have found it easy to use, both for listening to MP3's and the FM tuner. (I have not used the voice recorder.) I have used the player only with MP3's ripped from CDs I own, not with a subscription music service. The sound quality is good.Pros: Easy to use, good amount of storage space, takes standard AAA batteries, FM tuner.Cons: A little bulky, although it fits in a standard shirt pocket; the headphones did not fit my ears and I replaced them with the Sony MDR-EX51LP, which are very comfortable; the LCD display is hard to read when the player is in the plastic case that comes with it and you are wearing sun glasses (which I usually am when I am using it outside)."
1,Streaks and Smudges,"I can't get this replacement cartridge to print without streaks and smudges on the page. I would definitely not order it again, despite the appealing price."
2,~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~Great Brazilian Jazz ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~,"...Filó is a superb artist; in some of the cuts in this Album is just him and his guitar in multiple-recording and that's the perfect show-case for him. My favorite cuts are: ""AGUA VIVA"" (great song with the typical Brazilian Jazz scatting like Celso Miguel), ""TEMA DISTORCIDO"" (Fantastic vocals in multiple-recording - was described in the liner like: Take 6, but I think Filó's technique is a lot better considering it's just him), ""PAM PAM"" (It'll be hard you can find a freshest song around) , and ""TAKE 5"", (I think you can have Al Jerrau's version of this super-classic mixed with George Benson's and you'd probably would come close to Filo's version).If you're into Brazilian Jazz or love Brazilian rhythms, this is absolutely for you !!!"
2,DVD-R quaility OK,"I hope the studio does a full blown release with features, while Kirk is still around to do a commentary track. However, the video quaility is excellent, No menu, no chapters and no frills."
2,"After the 2000 elections, this book is far more entertaing!","Very entertaining... watching Eddie Quinn doublecross the bosses and the fat cats, only the hardest of the hard-hats could root against this happy represntative of the hard-hats.... the plot twists and turns throughtout the book.It's hard to figure on who Eddie Quinn most reminds me of by today's political standards. Mix in a little Bill Clinton, a little bit of Ross Perot and a dash of ""Dubya"" and you have yourself an Eddie Quinn. By all accounts, this book will have you thinking of the 2000 election.Also, most people don't know, but George Bush (the father) has read this book and really enjoyed it."
1,my time in hell,don't waste your time.This is not what we are about. Read Alcorn's stuff instead....
2,Great product,"I needed an adapter for my stereo system, this works Great and I did not have to spend much at all!"
1,ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!,"Ridiculous, kitsch, a complete waste of time. The heroine is stupid beyond belief, the book's storyline heavily underestimates the reader's intelligence, and the prose is close to illiterate, not to mention the novel's pathetic dialogue. An exercise in bad taste.Anyone who dresses like Lorgin should be in jail.All in all, extremely trashy. My first and last attempt to read a Dara Joy novel."
2,A Sure-Favorite At the Day Care!!,"This is one of the Most Requested movies at our Day Care Center and certainly one of my personal favorites!! Everybody in the movie is wonderful....Mr. and Mrs. Little (Geena Davis is really great!!), big brother George, SnowBell, the impostor Mom & Dad Mouse Family, everybody is great, just I really can't stand Stuart that much!! GASP!! Maybe it is just that he is so naive. He jus thinks everybody loves him. Or maybe it is just that he is so stupid as to think that the Little's were so glad to get rid of him they cut his picture out and he believes SnowBell. I know, I know, that is the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY, but it bothers me a little. So I give 'Stuart Little' 4 Stars, and well, maybe 4 and a Half."
2,Greatest pan I have ever owned,"This is one of the best designed and functioning pans I have ever owned. Heats very evenly. Nonstick surface cleans beautifully. It is awesome for sauces, sauteing, and reducing. Glass lid lets you see how things are cooking without removing the lid and splattering all over, however the lid handle does get hot. Lid is designed such that you can drain fat or other liquids without losing any of the meat."
1,horrid,"If i could choose less than 1 star I would. Our child was to read this in h.s. english. I could only read 1 paragraph, my husband 2 pages and we knew there was no way our child was reading it. The language was over the top offensive, and the way it portrayed American soldiers was deplorable. I can't believe this is touted as great American literature, and a need-to read for children."
2,very funny,"Dirty Deeds definitely falls into the catagory of movies that are just flat out amusement. it's definitely worth watching if you're looking for a good laugh. It obviously falls into the teen comedy genre, with like American Pie and Road Trip style movies.It's got Milo Ventimiglia from Gilmore Girls in it, and for most girls that's enough reason to watch it, at least once. He's definitely not his Gilmore Girls character. He plays a geeky type, but totally lovable as he tries to complete the 10 Dirty Deeds in twelve hours! It's completely nuts and turns into a wild night.If you like hilarious teen comedy's, you'll love this movie."
2,sgt. pepper,"Great fun read. As a Vespa owner and a huge fan of travel in Italy it was a close as I could come to making the trip myself. If you have ever dreamed of cruising around Italy with Audrey Hepburn on the back of your Vespa (and what mature male hasn't) this is your book. Or if you haven't had the dream yet, read the book and you will."
1,USB 2.0-A to Mini-B Cable 2 Meter/6.56 Feet Black,"I ordered 2 of these cables to replace one that was lost for my dughter's Smartphone. Well they were very cheap and they didn't work...So, save yourself money and just buy the manufacturers cable otherwise you will be donating to the Bad Cable Foundation of Whatever Interprises that got my hard earned money but did not deliver a useable product.....[....]"
1,Does not work,"No reception on any of the available frequencies. I live in a rural area with plenty of un-used frequencies and should have had no problem with the signal. It is a cheap piece of junk and I would never recommend it to anyone. I would give it a zero star rating, but it wasn't an option."
2,Bicycling Magazine's Complete Guide to Bicycle Maintenance,"I wish I had found this book a few years ago. I am an avid bicyclist and live in a more rural area. To have my bike serviced I must travel at least an hour one way. This book has helped tremendously with important adjustments to derailers, brakes and also measuring for good fit for a good ride."
1,You'll learn Flash alright....but it'll bore you to death!!,"It's very educational but the contents...yuck. I want a book to INSPIRE me to USE the program i'm learning, this book has text that'll put you to SLEEP and illustrations a five-year old could have done better. The only thing that keeps me from giving it an ""ABSOLUTE SUCKS"" review is that you ACTUALLY(!) learn from this book, so if you buy this you'd better be stubborn about learning Flash, otherwise i'd wait until a better, more creatively inspiring book comes along. Learning: 4 stars, Fun: 1 star"
1,The actual performance of the material is lacking,"I'm comparing this CD to Two for the Show and Live at the Whiskey.The performances of the songs are rather lifeless and lethargic.The instrumentation is still on top form, but the vocals are weakThe sound quality is excellent.The keyboards seem to be buried in the mix, which is a shame because hearing them more would have improved thingsWhile the first cd is 62 minutes, the second cd is only 34 minutes, not including the 5 minute video where the video quality is very good.Overall it gets a 3/10By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves, thus the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
1,Read the Book,"This is a perfect example of why one should read the book first. In this case Philippa Gregory's Boleyn books provided just the right mix of history and speculation to make for an indulgent read. The movie however was exhaustingly boring. I could hardly wait for Anne to be without head. I find Natalie Portman generally a pleasure to watch. In this role she was simply silly, unbelievable both as a tricky temptress and/or a victim. The larger casting error here was Scarlett Johansson. She is unconvincing at best in this period piece. I suspect as with her singing, if the audience cannot be distracted by her breasts her lack of talent really shines through. This movie was visually attractive with out be screaming big budget. More character development may have resolved the casting errors. Or not."
2,"Same DW918 you know and love, now with the NANO foot","I sold all my DeWalt stuff locally and bought new, everything with the ""nano"" foot for the square lithium ion batteries. Some items still run the old photos, but I got everything from Amazon and all with the new shape. Still accepts the oval NiCd batteries with the same positive connect. Now if you get Li batteries you won't see the oval overhanging them.Has storage for a spare bulb, but does not include the spare bulb."
2,Ralph Sharon Trio play the music of Irving Berlin,"This is one of a set of 5 CDs released in 2000 by Avid. The Trio comprises Ralph Sharon on piano, Lennie Bush on bass and Jack Parnell on drums, all of whom played in the Ted Heath orchestra at some time. Lennie Bush also played in Jack Parnell's ATV orchestra. The other CDs in the series feature the music of George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers. There are 20 tracks on the disc including three medleys. The tempo at which some of the tunes are played are not the ones we hear most often - but the music is none the worse for that. The Trio often include the verses as well as the refrains of some of the songs."
1,Worst Adaptation Ever!!!,"I can hardly believe Amazon's review and customers review of this movie. While the casting of characters like Elizabeth and Mrs.Bennett was exquisite, it is contrasted poorly by pitiful casting, for example, Pike as Jane.The thing with novel adaptations is that character's image will be different from one reader to the next so no movie will ever satisfy, in the regard, every audience member. But the characteristic is unquestionable and so is the mood of each scene. The director poorly captured certain mood and disposition of minor characters such as Mr.Bennett and Jane.I give up. Forget expalining every minute detail on how the director butchered a masterpiece. Everybody please, stop watching movies...."
1,Garbage,"Do not confuse this with the ""James Bond Dossier,"" a great work for any Bond fan. This is really just junk and not worth the price."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"If you want to read more about the exploits of Richard and Kahlan, go back and reread the first couple books in the Sword of Truth Series.The book, while it DOES involve random, uninteresting characters, features only token appearances by the main cast in the rest of the Sword of Truth series, and is not worth buying. Also, except for the fact that Goodkind has outlined how the magic in his world will die out in a couple thousand years, there seem to be no outward plot developments... The Imperial Order is unaffected, as are all the nations under Richard.Hopefully, this book was a mistake that Goodkind will put behind him; I know that many of us readers would hate to think that he has dried up as badly as Robert Jordan seems to have.As a whole, this book left me abysmally dissappointed."
2,Ashanti -- the Britney of R&B,"Yes, Ashanti is like the Britney Spears of R&B music. But that's not a bad thing. Like Britney, she was very heavily promoted and her album became an instant success. Her debut single, ""Foolish,"" also hit #1 on the charts, staying there for weeks.Her voice is light and enjoyable, as are her songs -- also like Britney. While she's not the greatest singer I've heard, her voice is very nice and pleasant.This is a cool CD, and I don't agree with several critics that her songs are too fluffy and lack substance. You have to give the girl credit for writing almost every song on the album.Definitely go buy it, if you're in the mood for some fun summer music from the princess of R&B and hip-hop."
2,My health and weight-loss answer!,"I have lost 30 lbs. and feel healthier and more alive than ever. I thought it would be very hard to give up processed foods and live on real, unprocessed, whole foods; but, it has not been. I will always enjoy an occasional unhealthy food; but, this program is my new way of life. It's not a diet. It's a new way to live in optimum health!"
2,One of the last recordings of this fantastic Quartett,"The Quartetto Italiano is one of the mistics ensemble.They were fatastic in Beethoven (the last Quartets...)Ravel, Debussy, Webern, Mozart etc.This is one of the last recordings they did. And with Pollini, one of the most complete pianists of our time.This is my favourite recording of this music.I had the LP and now I have this CD. Maybe the time of the CD is short.But if you want to know this music this is the ideal recording."
1,Defective DVD-On my 3rd Copy,"I'm really impressed with what Beck has attempted here. Sadly, I don't know if I will ever get to see all of the features the DVD is supossed to offer. I have already exchanged it twice because the DVD freezes up repeatedly, and my 3rd copy is doing the same. The manufactuer will be getting alot of returns. I hope that they will address the problem. Anyone know how to contact a distributor? The one star is only because of the major defects on the DVD. Beck's new work is fantastic."
1,don't bother,"There is nothing in this book that is not in the MSDN documentation (comes with Visual Studio, and is freely available at the MSDN site). In some cases, this book actually tells you less than the class library reference help. E.g., the example code regarding metafiles in MSDN has more detail than this book -- and that's not a lot! The examples in the book are just way too simplistic. In places, it seems plain that the help reference has basically been copied. Every time I check this book when I'm facing a real-world problem, the book is useless. There is nothing regarding best practices. It almost seems as though the author has not done serious work with GDI. Other books in this series from Addison are ok, but not this one."
2,For dogs who can destroy anything,"I have a bull terrier.. you know, Pattons dog, the Target dog, Spudz McKenzie. He may be a medium size dog but he's all mouth. We can't give him tennis balls or baseballs- he will eat them- in a matter of hours. We have been getting him Kong toys for the last 2 years. The black toys are the most indestructable, but even those after a few months meet their demise in shreds and bits. Either way- this is the best out there- and my dog LOVES them. His favorite are the red octogon balls. It takes him about 3-4 months to destroy one and he carries it everywhere. Our vet says its the best toy out there for his teeth (it keeps them clean). Its made of a really dense rubber material so he doesn't swallow it, he spits it out (he actually ate all his other toys!) I recommend it."
1,Only ONE episode!,"This is a show, but the DVD is only one episode. Even $5 is too much for one episode. Thanks"
2,"A good, strong cordless vacuum","This is second Eureka 96B I have purchased. Other than the vendor (True Value) shipping a purple color when the photo and prior one was black, it is an excellent cordless vacuum. Lots of power and easy to use, also does not scratch wood floors."
2,The remastered Black Hole is a bright spot on my shelf....,"I just finished watching my new Black Hole video and man was it fantastic!! The only way I've been able to see this movie was either on TV(which did not look great) or rental(which did not look great), so I am thrilled with this new, better looking version. The movie might not be THE best sci-fi film out there, but it reminds me of when I was a kid, playing with the B.H. toys, far more care-free days than today. But still, this movie is a modern day classic, and nobody can say otherwise."
1,POOR AT BEST,"DIDNT DO IT FOR ME,THIS PRODUCT IS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER OVER THE COUNTER MOISTURIZER,STILL HAVE WRINKLES AND STILL LOOK THE SAME,KEEP YOUR MONEY."
1,Ok.,"I liked this film for it's absurdity, locations and ....something. DiCaprio, 27, plays a guy who's presumably 17 or so. To be honest, he doesn't do it all that well, but the other actors are fine, though none of them are very involving.It felt like some scenes were missing, a character asks DiCaprio why he all of a sudden went crazy and the audience never found out why either. The movie could have been directed in a deeper style, esp. for the end scenes. I could see it being a book, but they should have adapted it much better than this!"
1,Failure to charge,"I bought this at a local electronics store a few months ago. At first, the lights wouldn't turn on to indicate it was charging. I knew it was getting power because I had a bluetooth headset plugged into the side port. After many attempts, I finally got the unit to work (all I kept doing was attaching and removing the controllers). It worked well for about a week then completely stopped working again. I haven't succeeded in getting it to charge again. Ironically, now the green light just flashes repeatedly even though there isn't a controller attached to it. Judging by the other reviews, I may have simply bought a faulty unit but I'm not about to waste another $30 to find out."
2,Good Enough To Keep Me Playing,"Don't have to worry about batteries or re-charging batteries anymore. Since it's cheaper than the original ones, the material is expected to be cheap too, especially for the buttons. But if you're just going after something that will work and keep you playing then this should do. The wire is long enough but I use a USB extension cable to make it longer and reach as far as I want to."
1,Leaky Batteries,"Rapid Charger is a little big to be travel portable in an age where carry on space is at a premium. However, the biggest problem is the batteries themselves started leaking within 6 months of purchase. This doesn't create confidence in the product. i wouldn't buy it again."
2,Great product for a small environmental impact,"First time I've tried line drying my clothes. The effort was for energy savings. I just didn't want anything large or obtrusive in my yard so these were perfect. Now that we have used them for several weeks, we love them. Great product...easy to install and take down when not in use. Great value for low cost & no shipping."
1,for laughs only,"It's hard to believe this is what the TOHO company has sunk too. Mothra looks like someone went down to their local department store, bought a fuzzy chew toy for dogs, brought it home and sewed some wings and legs on it. That can be the only work the ""monster"" makers did. Even funnier and more ridiculous that megalon with his dremel drill bit arms.Then there's the atrocious acting and plot, the dumb fat kid and the equally dumb and ugliest girl I've ever seen on screen. This ain't no Godzilla vs Hedorah or Rodan. Watch this on satellite if you must but don't waste money on it."
1,Disappointing movie,"I haven't read the book, so I don't know how faithful it is to it. But I was very disappointed in the movie.I had heard of it as a Christian allegory. It includes what is essentially a crucifixion and resurrection scene (the lion Aslan agrees to be killed to save the life of Edmund, a boy portrayed as a traitor), but this seems awkwardly placed in an otherwise secular action movie. It just doesn't fit. This was the major source of my disappointment in the movie. On the whole the movie did not seem to me to represent Christian values, and the crucifixion and resurrection bit semed quite discordant with the rest of the movie.The acting was generally good, with the two young actresses playing the two girls offering particularly outstanding performances. But it was basically a fairly run-of-the-mill action movie with the discordant Christian reference just plopped into it."
2,"Great album, great voice","This is the first R&B album that I bought so I really was not sure what to expect, but when I put this cd into my stereo I was amazed on how such an artist like Avant can transform his toughts into a musical ballad. I was truly captured and think by far that Avant is probably one of the greatest R&B singers out there, even better than R Kelly."
1,Just not interesting. . .,"I was SO disapointed in this sequel! I adored Peeps, and other works by Westerfield, so I kept hoping this book would improve until the very end. I think it was the characters. . .they didn't drive the book like Cal and Lace did. Plus since it skipped around in point of view a lot (which I ususally like), you never got a real sense of personality from anyone. The plot was pretty empty. . .not at ALL like Peeps. Still, Westerfield wrote it, and it had a few decent bits."
2,A Blueprint for Peace,This is a great book with fresh ideas for the future of Middle East Peace. Ferraris has realistic suggestions and recommendations for the future of world peace.Jerusalem and the way the U.S. deals with Isreal on the world stage is at the heart of the current Middle East conflicts.
2,Stones to Build On,"The Serenity Prayer has been used by thousands of people for the wisdom in its words. This little book takes you through each significant phrase, using runes as a learning tool.Runes are simply stones but as the book explains this is a lovely blend of old and new, helping to build and nourish the spirituality within all of us.This prayer is often used by people in 12 step programs, and the book and the runes can complement the prayer, making it even more meaningful.Reading the book, following the simple directions is a very good way of slowing down, breathing deeply and finding peace in your life."
2,Biggest Improvements I have heard in a good while,"well their last cd... good though a pile of punk pop... this record is much more mature... kinda shows how much of a trend some of this punk pop is ... this is one of the best records of the year.. its very well written, musically and lyrically... its just an amazing record... though some complain that its a new style... so what they matured maybe if all the other punk bands would take their cue the music scene would be a whole lot better than this recycled garbage... yet if ya feel like latching on to the pop punk trend go buy a blink 182 or good charlotte record... because we all know that they just make groundbreaking smart music that has the maturity of a 13 y/o kid"
2,Great product!,This heating pad has met all my expectations. The longer length is just waht I needed. I am so glad I purchased it!
1,Not a Bissell - DO NOT BUY,"What was sent to me is not a Bissell brand filter. Does not fit my Bissell vacuum, it is too small. It says it fits Claenview and power Force vacuums. It is made by More Quality Less Money. Generic filter, DO NOT BUY. I read other reviews that said the same thing; I should have listened to them. It's difficult to return since it is not sold from Amazon. I will be sending it back anyways."
2,What a breeze!,I love this mixer. ... I make cut-out cookies on a regular basis and the mixer I had was not adequate...I had to hand mix the flour into the batter...Not with this mixer. No need to worry about getting my hands dirty. I have also used the dough hooks for making bread and was very pleased. I would highly recommend this mixer to anyone. ...
2,This makes understanding The Bible so much easier,"Anyone who loves reading The Bible will definitely love The Story. It is concise, easy to read print and most of all easy to understand."
2,great film yet somehow empty,"i was enchanted with the book by author golden and simply had to see the film, which combines award winning cinamatography, great costume design, and a steller cast to bring to life the world of a geisha. chiyo comes from a small fishing and is then suddenly taken away to the town of gion were she will become later in life one of the most famous geisha's ever. along the way she must deal with her rival hatsumomo while under the guide of her mentor mamahe all the while trying to get the attention of the chairman. the film is stunning, excpetioly the cinamatography which got a well deserved oscar, the adaptation is great and yet, somehow after i finished watching the film i felt empty, as if something was missing. i havent written a four star review in a while, the last one being a year ago, but i had to adress this issue. why did the film leave me empty? i may never know but i still find it a great film."
2,Tales From the Brothers Grimm and the Sisters Weird,This book is full of variations of many famous fairy tales. I was particually interested in the varition of Rumpelstiltskin. Velde also wrote a book called the Rumpelstiltskin problem which includes one of these stories which creativly shows the different twists of the story! Very interesting.
2,Lessons from the master of PMA!,"I wasn't sure if I needed yet another Napolean Hill program. I already had Think and Grow Rich and few other tapes that Hill had produced. And I really didn't know if I was ready for 12 hours of tapes.Now that I have bought the tape set, I can honestly say that this was one of the best investments I ever made. Hill covers the 17 principles like never before. Hill is witty and funny too.This tape set is almost like a audio version of The Law of Success. It contains live lectures done by Hill in the 50's. If you have never heard Hill do a live lecture, then you must get this set. It is outstanding. Hill is fantastic and the material is incredible."
1,DON'T SUPPORT BOOTLEG EDITIONS,"This is an excellent video but any true fan of X will refuse to buy it because the company producing this DVD and has the legal rights to the film are not allowing ANY PROCEEDS TO GO TO THE BAND! VHS version and Laserdisc versions are available online. The band is trying to reacquire their rights to this production. Support the band, not bootleggers."
2,What a life saver.,"This game is sooo much fun. It makes a long trip much more manageable and is fun for the whole family. My kids are too young to keep score, so we usually set a goal of how many points we'd like to achieve and work as a team to get that amount before reaching our destination. Just a caution, this game is not great fun for those who easily get carsick."
2,LOVE CHI shampoo!,"This shampoo is great! It makes my frizzy hair so much more manageable. It helps to take the frizzies away. The only tiny complaint I have about it is that I have to use a ton just to get it to lather up. I guess the ingredients are just not lather-rich, so no big deal."
2,IT NEEDED TO BE SAID,"I wish this book would've been around when I was in my 20's. I enjoyed reading a more balanced approach to feminism. Lukas is not anti-woman, stuck in the '50's, or patriarchal as her critics have described. She's not telling women what they can or cannot do either. She's done her research and put the fact out there for your review. The biggest drawback for me was that it looks like a 3rd grader proofread the book."
2,ANOTHER MORRICONE MASTERPIECE,"As with all soundtracks by Ennio Morricone such as THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is simply masterful.The hallmark of any Morricone soundtrack is his use of the human voice as a non-vocal instrument. ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is no exception.This soundtrack is a terrific addition to any classic soundtrack collection. And it matters little whether you are a fan of the movie or not or whether you are a fan of westerns or not. The musical quality of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST stands on its own."
2,GREAT FOR NON-CABLE/SATELLITE USERS,This is a very good product and it does everything that it says it will do. My only complaint is that it drops a frame or 2 during the recording and I find that somewhat annoying during playback. I don't normally watch TV on my computer so I found it much more enjoyable after buying a large monitor. I have no opinion on using that the atenna provided.
1,"Cynical, heartless slapdash quickie gets everything wrong","This film is bad on every way possible to be bad. It looks like it was shot in five days by people who'd never seen a film before and never read the book. It's obviously just a cheap riopoff designed to steal people's money. Fine. Nothing wrong with that. Plenty of ripoffs can be fun. Trancers was more fun than Blade Runner for me, but I'm not pretending it was better like some people are with this. This is just boring, goes on forever and doesn't care - as long as they've got three hours of something they can call War of the Worlds they can get on to DVD at the same time as the big movie, they don't care.Here's what they give you for your money: No love, no care, no fun. If you want to encourage the kind of people who make this kind of crap, fine, buy it. But they'll be laughing at your gullibility, promise you that."
1,This is a horrible pretentious movie,"Hollywood makes such rubbish these days that an offbeat movie like Magnolia garners praise from critics and moviegoers. I did not relate to, nor did I like any of the characters, except the young boy who was scared on the game show. The characters got on my nerves. The highlight of the movie is Tom Cruise's narcisstic/antisocial character. Other than that I was waiting for the movie to eventually make sense, but it's just a 3 hour- long mess. So what if all of these characters are screwed up? As a viewer I did not really care about these characters."
1,Better stuff out there.,"This is the best of Jay Robert Nash's generally not very good volumes of crime history. It has a wonderful bibliography, probably including hundreds of books, pamphlets, documents, articles, etc., that Nash hasn't read, and a magnificent collection of photos, maybe the best anywhere. Other than making a good doorstop, however, that's about the best that can be said of this book. It's literally strewn with errors and also borrows shamelessly, from such books as Capone by John Kobler and The Bad Ones by Lew Louderback. If you're looking for a good historical crime encyclopedia, pass this one up and go to The Encyclopedia of American Crime by Carl Sifakis."
1,Very Disappointing,"Celine is one of my all time favorite singers but this cd has very poor song selection. I only like 4 out of 13 songs, and one of the ones I like, ""Have You Ever Been In Love"", is on her previous release. Why does someone put the same song on 2 straight releases? I will always give Celine 5 stars on vocals, but most of the songs on this cd aren't worthy of being sung by such a magnificent voice. Overall this cd is a waste of Celine's great talent."
1,Second Rate Score to A Second Rate Film,"With all due respect to the subject of this material, it's not the best movie based on the life of Christ, and the music is second rate at best. If you want to watch (or listen to) a decent made movie on Jesus, I highly recommend Mel Gibson's ""The Passion"" instead. The Passion is accurate, very well acted, even better directed...and carries a much better, higher quality soundtrack."
2,Rock & Roll,"Parents,My 8 year old boy loves Cookie Monster but Cookie Monster is not in this that much. But this is a very good video. This video tape is very rare. It is so rare it has a small miunte part with the Count's wife the Countess in it. If you have this video you are very lucky."
2,Solid lock,"I initially bought this lock to serve as my primary lock. However, I later bought the Kryptonite noose lock b/c of it's ability to accomodate larger object (i.e. building pillars). That is not to say the evo is not a good lock - I actually really like it. I keep my noose lock at school and bring my evo with me everywhere else. Along with a cable, the evo will protect my bike from most thieves.Ryan"
2,They Fought Like Warrior Poets,"Braveheart is nothing short of a masterpiece of film making. Gibson directs this beautiful piece in which he stars as Scottish hero William Wallace - a man who's quest for revenge turns into a fight for freedom from tyrannical British rule. Winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture, and also featuring a stellar supporting cast and a magnificent score by James Horner, Braveheart is a classic that belongs on any movie-goer's shelf"
1,Voltage Too High,"I recently purchased one of these from a display at a large, nationwide discount store. When I plugged it in to an LG Optimus C, Android phone, the display started behaving strangely and the phone started initiating commands. Upon measurement, it would appear the voltage is a full eight volts above specifications! A fault such as this should have never gotten past the most basic QA inspections at the end of the line.This item is going back to the nationwide discount store this evening. I do not normally write gratuitously negative reviews. However, the other reviewers are right. I just wish I had read them before going to buy one of these."
1,A problem,I have worked with several writers who hold Robert McKee as their personal Jesus. Every one of these writers has been irretrievably lost in terms of story structure. Read Gerard Genette if you actually want to learn anything.
1,Snapped!,The straps broke after two months and now I can not find any replacement. So the pads are useless... need to sell additional straps or supplies!
2,Works Great But Has Proprietary FME Connector.,"I tried a Wilson dual band magnet mount antenna #301103 but it wouldn't pick up any signal so I sent it back and bought this #301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. The first one must have been defective. The only drawback with this one is the cheap FME connectors that Wilson uses that break easily and are not compatible with anything else so you have to buy one of their special adapters or a pigtail with the correct ends on it to connect to your phone.Update, this antenna won't receive anything on the 1700Mhz band used by T-Mobile for ""4G""."
2,Great die grinder!!,"Very useful die grinder. Not to heavy for long work periods.Durable, have used this item for years."
1,Awful!,I expected more than a handful of moves done quickly but over and over and over and overad infinitum! It drove me mad!
2,Amazing & Hot....Damita Jo sizzles!,"This is her best release since Rhythm Nation. I personally did not care for The Velvet Rope or All For You. Damita Jo has refreshing tracks such as Spending Time With You, Like You Don't Love Me and I Want You as well as party tracks like Slolove and Strawberry Bounce. The interludes add to the hot cd. I think this is Grammy Worthy.Janet still has it!"
2,"A album that makes me want to cry,laugh,and smash my windows","Glassjaw sends you on the a roller coaster through hell and back. With Daryl's bi-polar singing, juicy guitar riffs, and a great dummer; Glassjaw are going to lead the kids after the deftones gracefully step down from the throne of Hardcore."
1,Rip off,This is a complete rip off. The protection they provide is worthless since they do everything they can to frustrate your attempt to make a claim and to find any excuse for not fulfilling their commitment. Save your money.
2,Happy Kids!,Kids love it! Had to buy 2 so each one could have one of thier own! Very satisfied wth this movie the price on Amazon!
2,Huh?!,"First off, I would like to mention that I hope I am reviewing the correct album. I owned an album by Kode IV called ""Possessed"" that was put out by Kk Records, but none of the tracks I see listed here were on that album...? That said, I will review the album I know of.Kode IV was an industrial-dance band that, over time, segued into ambient and goa styles of techno. This album (which I believe may be their first) was firmly planted in the industrial-dance/EBM vein similar to their Belgian compatriots, Front 242. The whole album is laden with samples and imagery from ""The Exorcist"", creating a sinister atmosphere that runs through many of the songs. If you're into the late '80s/early '90s EBM sound (like Front 242, Cat Rapes Dog, and Nitzer Ebb), then this Kode IV album (and another one, ""Insane"") should be sought out."
2,Fantastic picture quality,"Great for all basic shooting, travels, etc. Better picture quality than smaller cameras."
1,OK for lightweight storage,"This is a relatively decent storage option, provided you're only storing lightweight items. It does *not* hold heavyweight items well - if too much weight is in the drawers, the drawers will not open. You also cannot put much weight on the top before it bends and obstructs the opening of the top drawer. However, these are remarkably inexpensive, and if you don't have heavy things to store, are worthwhile. Personally, I would have paid more for a more substantial storage solution if I had realized the limited use of these drawers."
2,Dreambaby Hallway Gate,I bought 3 Dreambaby Hallway Gates - one needed an extension. They are FABULOUS - completely easy to assembly and install. We assembled and installed them in about 10 minutes - they are secure and do NOT require any screwing into the walls. Very happy with this product!! Even with a very active 1 year old who 'rattles' the gates - they do not budge and are very easy to open with one hand!
1,shagless,I'm really disappointed in this soundtrack. I don't remember most of the these songs on this soundtrack. It's so wrong!!
1,I must have gotten a bad one!,I found this Pepper Mill a really bad piece of crappolla. Cannot understand it after all these great reviews- maybe a I just got a lemon. Whatever- the grind was always changing- almost nothing to extremely course- and we had to fill it very often. Sent it back as a bad one and Amazon was good enough to refund my money. I got a T handle one that also reviewed well- we shall see if it is any better!
1,READ (fiction) Hogwash,"It is ashame the way this book is written, most people who read it may forget, it is a work of ""FICTION"" and confuse it with the truth. It paints ""Duke"" as a crude overbearing tyrant. John Wayne was human and I am sure had his faults, why exaggerate them and run down a man who gave the young and old of this country something to live up to"
1,These suck!,"They did not work at all. I tend to sweat a little too much when I get nervous or stressed. I wanted something that would keep me covered just in case. These were not it. I would recommend buying the washable ones that hook to your bra straps.1. The strips that you pull off to expose the tapes are very hard to remove without ripping the whole thing.2. They were hard to place in the garment. If your shirt or dress has any stretch at all, they will not stick properly.3. When I pulled the shirt over my head to put it on they came lose. I ended up trying to reach up through my shirt to replace them.4. They were too small. To absorb properly they need to be longer and probably wider. I am not a huge woman and they still did not cover the entire area.5. They are not very absorbent at all. It did not take long for me to sweat through them."
2,Wish we bought it sooner!,"We love this booster! It really makes my son feel like part of the family at the table. I am looking forward to being able to use it in our boat. We REALLY could have used it last year! It was such a chore to feed him there. Now, with our Caddy, it will be a breeze. Plus it is easy to fold and transport!"
2,keeps the temperature for a long time,"So I lost my old thermos and could not deal with drinking cold coffee after a while. I bought this one and lo and behold, hot coffee all day! It kept my coffee hot pretty much for 8 hours. I mixed it up and tried a cold drink and after a day at work I could still hear the ice cubes rattling inside! Pretty awesome for 8-9 hour work days! Not overly heavy and doesn't feel cheap either. I would definitely recommend this product!"
2,One of Systems Best Albums,"Along with their self titled album, these two are the best albums I have heard ever by any group."
1,Ying Yang is the perfect name for such an imperfect duo,"I wanna whisper a little something to all ya'll,(THIS ALBUM STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN ALONG WITH SLIMM SCRUB AND DEBBIE(AKA WEBBIE). They got the right name because every thing that comes out of their mouth is a bunch of Ying Yang. By them knowing that they talk a bunch of ying yang, they must know that they're weak. With all of my reviews toward Dirty south rappers, you might notice that they all sound the same because their music is all the same.PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP AND UNDERSTAND THEY'RE LISTENING TO GARBAGE.THE ALBUM TILTLE USA SHOULD STAND FOR UNDER SATURATED A*SES BECAUSE THEIR MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE S*IT."
2,Good For The Price,"For the price the watch is very good:Pros- eye pleasing- gold tone looks very elegant- eco drive makes battery replacement a non-issueCons- I would have to say is its low or non-existent water resistanceUnless you plan to go to the beach or pool with the watch on this is a great dress watch for any woman who wants to match with her earrings, necklaces, and bracelets."
1,baby alive: v so-so,"I cannot believe I bought Baby Alive after so many years of feeding and changing real babies... The novelty wore off almost immediately, daughter had an excited initial response, but once the task of purging and cleaning the dolly's system fell upon us, it was curtains. She much prefers the American Girl baby / dolls, as do I."
1,A Mislead Parent,I was under the impression that this tub had a working tub sprayer. I ended up returning 2 of them until finally getting one to work for only a couple of months. I figured I would suck it up and just use the cool net that holds my daughter up out of the water for at least 6 months or so until buying a new tub. Let me say that she has already outgrown this tub which should have lasted her through her toddler years. Oh and she's in the 25% for her age so you can't blame it on her size. The only reason I rated this product 2 stars was because it's little net did work and at least the product held water. If you still have the box take it back and go with the eurobath by primo. That's what I'm about to buy and I must say that is a TUB.
2,very good to excellent death metal,"this is a mix of incantation, possessed, and morbid angel; that is to say, very good death metal. excellent pocket grooves with not too many blast beats. good cover art reminiscent of hell awaits and blessed are the sick."
2,Kudos from an MD!,"As an MD I found it extremely frustrating to try curing weeping non-healing sores of type 2 diabetic patients, who also carried a 100 pounds stomachs around. What I found puzzling is that the public expects the pharmaceutical drugs a lot to solve problems which resulted from decades of overheating and under exercising. I think one of the major issues is for the public to understand the sheer power of nutrition and weight loss, compared to pharmaceuticals. My feeling is that patients all to often come to doctors for prescriptions, and tend to ignore, perhaps even find pathetic, advice about lifestyle change ( along the lines : I can hear it from my grandma, I dont have to come to a doctor to hear it ), while at the same time expecting a powerful Rx. This book/ film hopefully will change this perception."
1,Fragile,"My frame came chipped in several places, and got worse when i placed my print inside. I would definitely not recommend. You get what you pay for."
1,Turn on the radio!!,"I don't ususally trash an audiobook but this one left me wanting to listen to fingernails on a blackboard instead. The reader does not do hillbilly accents well, the plot was ridiculous and the quality was bad (I had to continually change the volume). Please stop. This one hurt."
2,"Bravo, Watson!","All the faves are here, ""Volare"", ""O Sole mio"", ""You Are So Beautiful"", ""Somewhere"" AND the best, ""E lucevan le stelle"". Glorious music, powerful emotion and endless thrills.Even if you are not a Watson fan, this is an excellent buy...and a great way to get into the music, and learn to enjoy classical music as millions of others have. Bravo!!!."
1,I hated it.,"I had to read this book a couple months ago, and I hated it. It may have been that I was forced to read it but I don't think so. I couldn't get into any of the characters. They were all just so bland and unemotinal. Don't buy this unless you need it for some reason out of your control."
2,Excellent,I have had this coffee maker for about 2 years and use it about 5-6 times a week. It has been free of defects and makes great coffee. It will pay for itself if you are a daily visitor to Starbucks like I use to be.
2,Entertaining Fairy Tale,"This is the story of how a farmer (and his dog) defend their farm from ogres and dragons and the like, which propels them reluctantly to fame and riches. Filled with irony, humor, and good morals, (not to mention fairy-tale action) it is a story that shows Tolkien's lighter side.Farmer Giles of Ham is a fairy tale like story. It is rather short, and LOTR fans will find it lacking a lot of the depth Tolkien usually has. I would recommend it to a younger audience to get kids interested in his greater works. Still, it is pretty entertaining."
2,I love this DVD set.,"After I read East of Eden, my fiance told me it had been made into a couple different movies. I was interested but I couldn't see how that extremely long, complex story could be made into a 2-hour movie. Enter this miniseries. It's older than I am (I'm 24), and while I absolutely fell in love with the novel I wasn't sure I could sit through about 6 hours of an old made-for-TV drama but I thought I'd give it a try. Wow, I was wrong. I love this DVD set. I tried to watch the 1955 movie with James Dean and I couldn't even sit through it; the acting seemed terrible and it started 2/3rds of the way through the novel! This adaptation is much truer to the original story. Some parts differ from the book but that's to be expected. The casting is superb - no ""what?! that's not how I imagined him/her!"" moments. Maybe it's just me but I want everyone to watch this movie."
1,Anodized not for frying,"I bought this Calphalon Commercial Hard-Anodized 12-Inch Everyday Pan with Lid in order to try to get away from non-stick surfaces that may affect your health. My health is in greater jeopardy now because I want to jump out the window after using this piece of junk. I've used 12"" non-sticks to cook eggs, hashbrowns, pancakes, etc. for 25 years, and I'll be buyiing a new non-stick today to replace this garbage product. I read all about cooking with anodized cookware on the instructions and on the Calphalon website. Cooking with oil is a deathwish in this pan, food sticks like it is coated with contact cement. The best results came from cooking with butter, but who wants to do that all the time? I am severely disappointed with this item, really hoped I would be able to move away from non-stick surface coatings"
2,This was a great book!!!,"I loved, loved ,loved this book!!! Anything by Julia Quinn is an automatic buy for me--especially in the Bridgerton series! I stayed up all night just to finish this one. It made for a wonderful night-- but an awful morning with my two year old!!! ..."
2,the Wonder of Ragtime,I bought this movie and it is a wonderful movie for children and adults. It is so funny and the animals are so talented. The owner trainer Patty Fairchild did a wonderfully training her animals. It would be a shame to miss out on this movie.
2,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"I was 5 years old when this movie was released, and I've loved it ever since. It has a great storyline. Sheriff Woody is the leader of Andy's toys, such as Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Bo Peep, Slinky Dog, Rex, Rocky and many more. On Andy's Birthday, he receives a Buzz Lightyear action hero, and Woody becomes jealous because he isn't Andy's favorite anymore. When Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out of the window, his friends want nothing to do with him. On the way to Pizza Planet, Buzz confronts him in the family van, and knocks him outside and the family drive off without them. They go through a lot trying to get back to Andy before they move. When they end up in Sid's room; the kid who tortures toys, Woody and Buzz must work together in order to make it out alive. I highly recommend TOY STORY!!!"
2,The Kitties You Know and Love,"The cats in these poems are all unique individuals, but they'll be familiar to any cat lover. We've all felt the tug of affection for a hungry stray. We've all been pleasantly trapped beneath a sleeping feline. And, if we're lucky enough, we've all looked back with tender nostalgia on the years we've spent with a beloved pet. This book of poems is perfect for cat fanciers of all ages."
1,Painter IX Creatiivity: Digital Artists Handbook,"I was disappointed in the Painter 8 book, and in this one as well. I bought it, because it was completely rewritten, and I thought it would be more usefulfor a photographer like myself who can't paint. Instead, it lacked things even the former edition had. He might be a good artist, but not a good textbook writer.,None of the images were on the CD for practicing along with the lessons. Settings for the brushes were not included in the lessons. Vague generalities were used to describe how to do cloned paintings. Only 2 chapters covered the actual painting/cloning process.Instead, I highly recommend Painter IX for Photographers by Addison, which has step-by-stem lessons that are specific and helpful!! It also has his images on the CD, so you can follow along."
1,No thanks.,Other than special effects this movie has very little going for it. I was not sympathetic to the characters at all.
1,Drive died after 1 month,"I bought drive to backup my work files. Great design, fairly compact. No software included for backups so you have to provide your own. Worked fine for 1 month but drive failed. Would not power up.RMA process costly and at your expense. You must ship in anti-static bag (so save box). No communication or response to 4 e-mails I sent - never had a company be so unresponsive. Not only did I lose 1 month of backups but it cost me quite a bit to ship back.Recommend if you buy it to don't rely solely on it for at least a few months. You have a chance of losing your only copy of something if the drive fails. Hope replacement is more reliable.*Update* Replacement drive was new (not refurbished) and has worked fine ever since. I must have gotten a bad unit. Drive is pretty quiet and power up quickly and is pretty intelligent to power down when not it use. Will be buying Acronis True Image or Norten Ghost to back up images/quicker to restore system than just backing up files."
1,Absolute drivel,"How the hell can anyone live with themselves after making this appalling pseudo pop-obscenity.Made with the accountants in mind, and one eye on her next major asset purchase, Liz sells out to the Man.I gotta go to the john."
1,Honest Judgement,These Roger Corman movies were very boring. There was little to enjoy other than fast-forwarding.
2,Sunset Harbor-Ed Calle,"I heard the piece Sunset Harbor on DMX and ordered the CD the same day. I have nearly worn out the cut of Rum & Coke. This CD has laid back and jump up, exactly how I like to listen to music. I highly recommend this CD and I intend to get more of his music."
1,Waste of free download,"The author of this material seems more interested in spouting her sexists opinions tha laying out good advice and strategy. She spends much of her time trying to work out her deep resentment of men. I kept reading and reading thinking at some point she would get past all the garbage and get to the point, but it did not seem to be forthcoming. I finally just deleted this waste and spent monye on a book that actually helps without all of the personal editorial and sexism.Skip this one."
1,I expected more,"I expected more, after seeing the other movies M. Night Shyamalan, I expected a good movie, but this is terrible. The only good thing that movie was the price."
1,Not What I Expected!,"In a way this CD blows, but in another way, it's good! When I bought this CD several years ago (2002), I thought there'd by some Tex Beneke vocals; but instead, all the vocals are by Ray Eberle, Dorothy Claire (subbing for Marion Hutton) and the Modernaires. The rest are instrumentals.If you want good Tex Beneke vocals, try else where, but don't look here. Try the ""Golden Greats"" CD (""My Melancholy Baby,"" song 17, CD 3) and ""Glenn Miller And His Orchestra"" (""The Lady's In Love With You,"" song 4, CD 1 and ""The Little Man Who Wasn't There,"" song 11, CD 1).And for better Ray Eberle vocals, do the same -- look for another CD. Or if you're a big Ray Eberle fan and want a CD with mostly his songs on it, than buy this."
2,"""I'm keeping flowers in full bloom""","The above line is from the fantastic song ""The Great Beyond"", which easily surpasses any individual song from the last three R.E.M albums. In lyric content, melody, and the great harmony on the chourus, it is superb. The musical score is intersting, but often slight. If you are a trememdous fan of R.E.M. or Andy Kaufmann, then of course you will want this. Otherwise, it's probably not worth your while."
1,YAWN!,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen!Bland, boring, poor script/story not even Mr Willis could save, I couldnt wait for it to end, and when it did... I spent the rest of the day wishing I was dead. Yes, thats how bad this movie is!"
2,Solid Value,"I bought this receiver in 2005 as part of a home theater in a box. It has performed flawlessly since then, processing and routing audio and video from DVD, VHS and broadcast sources, and outputting it via the 5.1 surround speakers. While it's video capabilities are stuck in the analog era, it's digital audio has always been crisp and robust to my untrained ears."
2,"Good, but no volume","This is quite a good DVD player, but it suffers from not having a volume control on the remote."
1,Um...Uh...not what I expected.,"After reading this book I found myself strangely dissapointed. By reading the back of the book I figured I had an excellent read on my hands. Well, I didn't. I definately didn't. The characters were undeveloped, (like paper dolls, flat.) and as soon as I started getting to know the characters, the book was over. In other words, it was much too short. You'd think a book so sad and touching(well, I think that was what the author was aiming for)would be a lot longer so you could start to feel what the protagonist(s) are feeling. Read it if you must, but only if you must."
2,A world that shocks and fascinates,"Asta's son has never had a name. But now that his mother has died, a priest tells him his name is Crispin. Accused of a crime he didn't commit, Crispin flees his village home. On his journey he meets a juggler named Bear, who teaches him the ways of entertaining, self defense, and snaring rabbits. At first Crispin is afraid of Bear, but the man takes care of him and teaches him to think for himself.Crispin's enemies continue to pursue him. Crispin wonders why they are so intent on seeing him killed? He is no one. He and Bear reach the city of Great Wexly where Crispin stumbles onto a dark secret that leaves him no choice but to fight for his and Bear's life.Crispin: the Cross of Lead is a story about a poor orphan in medieval England. Avi creates a world for the reader that shocks and fascinates as much as the plot. It's no surprise why this book earned the Newberry. I highly recommend it for everyone."
2,It's the only book my kids want to read now!!,My kids and I both love the whimsical nature of both Farmer Brown books by Teri Sloat. The wording and pictures go perfectly together and are good for a laugh and putting us all in a fun and silly mood. I hope there are more Farmer Brown adventures to come!
1,Paranormal Activity,"Movie was not good. Tried to imititate ""The Blair Witch Project"" which at least was quite a good movie. Couldnt watch this on my DVD player as it was asking for a Regional Code to be entered???Big disappointment."
1,Business Process Implementation : Building Workflow Systems,"To clarify something that Reviewer Yves Chaix said... ""As a reference though, I think that 90% of what I learnt, I actually picked from studying the excellent documents produced by the Workflow Manufacturers Coalition (www.wfmc.com).""Readers should know that the organization in question is the Workflow Management Coalition, and the website is www.wfmc.org. The WfMC is releasing the Workflow Handbook 2001 in October 2000, by the way. This is the new definitive reference to workflow management, with particular attention to e-business and B2B integration. It includes the full Wf-XML specification and glossary."
1,Worst watch I ever had,"This watch is a nice looking watch but very bulky. The automatic movement does not work well. This watch keeps poor time, losing about ten minutes a week if you can keep it running. The only way to keep it running is to wear it when you sleep at night. If you take this watch off and let it sit for eight hours it will stop. You have to reset this watch every single day. Also, the latch on the band is very poor and comes undone easily. I used this watch for about a month and threw it in the trash. It wasn't worth the postage to send it in for repair. All in all, the worst watch I have ever owned. No more Invicta automatics for me. The only reason I rated it a 1 star is because they didn't give me a choice of zero stars."
2,If only it didn't leave you red handed,"Great hose reel. Very heavy and well built and i'd give it five stars if it were not for one little detail. The hose that is supplied seems to have missed the addition of whatever chemical ingredient that keeps it from depositing its red color on everything it touches including your hands. I tried wiping the whole thing down with denatured alcohol to no avail. Oh well. Despite the fact that I was able to install mine on the ceiling by myself I doubt that any ordinary person could do the installation alone. Yeah, it's that heavy."
1,Poor Quality,"I'm sorry to give a negative review, but I'm afraid this product deserves it. I ordered the Pearlessence Spa Mist Air and was unpleasantly surprised by the cheap quality of the plastic used to construct this thing. The price was great, but it just wasn't worth it and I returned it. I can't recommend this at all.I've used a different ultrasonic diffuser in the past that was absolutely fantastic! You can see a similar product on amazon by doing a find for the Ultrasonic Misting DIFFUSER by Young Living (which I'm sorry to say is way overpriced). I think there's one Japanese company that makes these units, and then different companies take the units and brand them for themselves. I wish Amazon carried one of these at a reasonable price because I would order one in a heartbeat. They are high quality and work fabulously."
2,Electric knife,This is more than I expected for the money it is great and I love having a case to store it in and an extra bonus was the carving fork. Everyone should get this if looking for or wanting a electric knife. Thanksgiving is coming up. Great buy and works great
2,NO ONE DOES FATS BETTER THAN FATS. . .,". . but this ain't bad. As for disc 1, it's *****5 stars all the way, but as for disc 2, I'd have to give it only ***3 stars, so over all it rates ****4 stars for me. There are some real gems here."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product in Sept. 2008 for 18.79, now look at the price of 49.50. I contacted Amazon about this price several times and got the run around. Google this product and you can buy this from multiple places and get free shipping, plus get it for 18.99."
1,does NOT fit a 2001 Chevy Blazer,Does NOT fit a 2001 Chevy Blazer even though it said it would. Good return policy though... hence the extra star.
2,The best sounding electric strings I have ever used.,"First, some backround. I play a Gibson Les Paul Studio, a Godin Solidac, a Fender Stratocaster American Standard, and an Ibanez Artcore AFS75T (someday I'll get a Gretsch), and play via a Fender Blues Deluxe amp. I have been a pure nickel string purist for a few years. These sound better. The 1st time I put a set of these strings on my Les Paul, I was floored. Even my guitar teacher, who has used every string out there, was stunned. The best way to describe it is: it is like moving up to the next gauge while not increasing the tension and feel; i.e. I am used to playing .10s, but the change in tone sounds like .11s. And they last longer to boot (they are uncoated, by the way). Yes, I have played Pyramid strings, and I like these better; unlike the Pyramids, these strings did not require a new setup."
2,"Not quite timeless, but worth an hour or two","this play is not really laugh out loud material, but one can easily see how such absurd and dramtically ironic situations have worked their way into modern film/literature/plays.the comedy is sort of 19th century slapstick, which doesnt really entertain and delight...but what i found so priceless about this play was the universally shallow character of the cast....especially considering they are nearly all government officials. the very people who are supposed to selflessly ""protect and serve"" the people, are revealed as self-serving idiots who are only concerned with protecting themselves.i could see this making an excellent play with the right actors."
2,AWESOME,Love the music from start to finish!! Listen with my Daughter who sang some of these songs in high school productions!
2,Stepping out of the Comfort Zone into Adventure!,"I highly recommend- Wondrous Journey: The World is Waiting for You- to anyone who has traveled the world or hopes to one day. Dean Jacobs transforms a dream into reality when he leaves a comfortable, safe life in the US and sets out to explore this amazing world of ours. He not only discovers the physical and cultural wonders of many countries but finds much in common with the people he encounters and comes to know. Beautiful photographs, amusing anecdotes and his easy to read style of writing make this book an ideal gift or addition to a library."
2,My son loves it.,"My son, who is a toddler, loves this thing. We were concerned at first that he might be frightened by it,but he seems to be very curious about what it is and how it works. The lights and sound effects are alot of fun as well. Once we turn it on he follows it around like it was a real dog. I recommend it."
1,Boring,There is no melody or rhythm here. It sounds like an introductory lesson in how to play steel drum.
1,Don't Do It,"If you are a fan of some of the better simulation games, like the SimCity series, or even Tropico, etc., don't buy this game. The graphics are substandard, the gameplay is boring and unimaginative, and the interface is less than intuitive. This game is a blatant attempt to cash in on the reputation of some of the more succesful and better-made tycoon games."
2,"It works, if you need to get data off your phone",Simple product; it does what it's supposed to. I wish I had one of these originally before my phone died. I tried salvaging whatever information was left on it using this cable and was able to save a few things before reinstalling the phone software.
2,Very classy,"Bought this item for my husband for Christmas. It is very nice leather and like the stitching. It is nice it has the double compartment. The color was very true to the picture. Wish it had the option of getting it mommagrammed, but that is ok. Very classy and masculine look to it. I would recommend."
1,EA patch this thing now,"Even without the DRM issue, it's probably the most broken retail game I have ever played.Don't bother buying it until EA release a patch, you will be wasting your money."
1,Not the best in the world,"This book was definatly interesting to read, but it does not deserve to be in Oprah's Book Club. It's long and drawn out and is kind of a hard read, especially if you have a short attention span, but I do not regret picking it up. I wouldn't highly recommend this book."
1,do not touch this production with a broom stick,"The production is horrible. All the Russian national, local color and flavor are totally absent. The stage is littered with toy-like objects and symbols, ludicrous and ugly. So are the costumes.Russia is portrayed as a bowl of swarming and moving lice. Very good singing and acting do not help the production. The best part of this purchase is the disc box, unusually well made."
1,Won't play or rip on computer,"Most of the songs have skips, distortions or pieces of other songs when played on disc player! Won't play or rip on any computer tried (3). Sounds flat or not the right artists, he sounds better live today than this does. Don't bother buying it!"
2,My students LOVED it!,I have read Abiyoyo to my class for years at Halloween. I especially like to put it in my listining center. I can always tell when they're near the end because they burst into choruses of the song. This year I was able to read the sequel to them and it was a thrill to see their faces while I turned pages. They couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next! I can't wait for a CD version for my listening center.
1,Inspector Coliandro is possibly...,"...the worst production I can recall in many years. The plot is stupid and dull. There are NO sympathetic characters at any level. The acting is over the top andat the Junior High School level. The direction is done with a baseball bat rather than a baton. Writing is about as amature as anything I can recall.All in all, Inspector Coliandro is a monumental stinker, worthy of negative star rating.The only decent thing is the font used for the sub-titles.Detective Montalbano this aint.December/6/2011In fairness (a major personal failing of mine) I felt that my harsh review of this project may have beenover the top and possibly I missed something that would rescue the film from the cherem where itwas dispatched.I dug it out of the trash barrel and replayed it again. giving it a chance.NO. I was correct the first time.It totally sucks. No saving grace. Nada. Effes."
1,Treasure Trove of Economic Fallacies,"This book is a delight to read, if only because McFague manages to compress so much economic illiteracy into a single book. Zero-sum game fallacy, the confusion between matter and resources, dependency theory, the idea that the market economy destroys the environment, the identification of a market economy with consumerism. They're all here in abundance! I would give the book one star simply because it displays such ignorance about a subject it claims to analyze. But some credit must be given to McFague for packing so many mistakes into so small a space, and for lacking any sense of irony for enjoying a cushy high level academic salary while disdaining all those consumer-driven lumpen proletariats who get by on half her salary."
2,Pacman not same as arcade original...,"A great classic game, but for those Old-School Pacman players please note that this game does not change the maze, EVER. It just continually increases the speed of the game untill the gosts are a blur and you cant possibly win. There IS an option to make the Game FULL screen if you read the game manual."
2,Good classic,"I decided to finally re-read The Great Gatsby since I only read the cliff notes edition back in high school :) Great story, really transplants you right in the thick of things - 1920's New York City glamor."
2,"Solid Story of Nature, Red in Tooth and Claw","This was a fantastic picture! A young naturalist of humble origins, William Adamson, finds a scientific soulmate in the super-aristocrat Reverend Alabaster, and is invited to live with the Alabaster family to help educate the children and to help the Reverend with his naturalist studies. Unaccustomed to the opulent aristocratic lifestyle, William falls in love with the extraordinarily beautiful and glamorous oldest Alabaster daughter, Eugenia. The eldest Alabaster son, Edgar, resents the commoner's hanging on. Can William accomplish any worthwhile scientific work while surrounded by the idle rich? What if he could have Eugenia? Would she welcome William into her upper-crust caste? Is that where William wants to be? An amazing film, extremely well acted, I loved it. A movie you can sink your teeth into. Highly, highly recommended."
1,This was a big let down...,Beautiful scale that only lasted a couple of months. I would not recommend it at all. It would also get dirty very easily and hard to clean underneath. I'm so tired of homedics all together.
2,Great value for price paid,"Stand was a little less sturdy than I had hoped, but 13-year-old daughter has now had it 10 months and had absolutely no trouble at all. She does not take it apart frequently, but can disassemble and reassemble it quickly herself, with no problems. Great value for small $$$."
1,Be ready to fall asleep,"I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated."
2,You've Been Using It Wrong,The guy is correct. You all have been using the headset wrong. Its a common mistake. I even wore it that way a few months before I realized there was a mic integrated inside.You adjust the position of the white clip that is located between the earbuds and the microphone. Seperate the clip into two halves. Reconnect the clip in the back so that your neck is between the mic and the clip. Then plug the earbuds in your ears.I have to say that the mic is extremely sensitive. Even if you dont wrap the so that the mic is closer to your mouth you will still be heard. I have had complaints about being too loud when I wear it how it is designed to be worn. I even have conversations with it through my winter coat without a problem.
2,It was pretty good,"I enjoyed the book for the most part and learned some things. However, he seemed to repeat the information a lot (guess repetition is the key to memory). It was to a point that annoyed me though, then again repetition annoys me period. lol. Also, somethings kinda contradicted themselves, but for the most part it was a pretty decent book and I did learn some things and def recommend this vs regular running relying on super thick soles praying the shoe will protect you. Which will! give you more injuries later down the road."
2,La Polla knows what they doing!,"I just start listen to this people recently,and think that they are a pretty descent band.Believe this is a pretty good album that will rock you up,better if you know the language.Probably if your not from Spain,don't know castillian language,and the spaniard's recent history,specially during and after World War II,will not understand a lot of the critics that the band are doing to the goverment,the police,the church,just like me that I'm from Puerto Rico,and I have to look in the internet to understand better what they talking about.Good music,good lirics,muy chevere band!"
2,swift delivery,Swift delivery! I will shop here again soon! I never thought I would love e-books so much. Thank you so much!
1,K9 Advantix is too dangerous to use!!!!!!!,"My dog almost died from using K9 Advantix. I used it on her in January & within 24 hours she started vomiting for 3 days straight. She was disoriented & could barely stand. Although I washed my hands after applying the product, I became nauseated after petting her & also vomited. Thinking it was a coincidence that we both were sick at the same time & not realizing the toxicity of K9 Advantix because those side effects are not listed on the package, I used it on her again last week (mid-March) and we both developed nausea again. This time my dog threw up for 4 days with blood. Because the exact same thing happened within 24 hours of using this product on 2 separate occasions, I was able to make the connection. Then I searched the internet & found hundreds of dog owners complaining of the same problem. Bayer needs to remove this product from the market!!!!!! Shame on them."
1,Wasnt' What I Expected,"when i opened the package i was expecting an assortment of drum stick wraps...cause that is what the picture is. What i got was single package with a design that wasn't even pictured in the ad, wraps for two sets of sticks. It was disappointing. I thought i would get the green ones plus the rest. I think i paid shipping so around 11 dollars for this and its not worth it. I would send it back if it didn't take so much work."
1,not quite fit.,did not help in overcoming the interference between the wireless camera system and the wireless network.
2,Another great one by Jan Karon!,While this book was shorter... it was nevertheless a great story! It is well worth the money and time!Mitford is the kind of place that we would all love to live.... a slpeey little town in the mountains where you know your neighbors. I recommend buying this book... and curling up in your favorite chair with a warm blanket and cup of hot chocolate! Turn the phones off and slip away... I guarentee that you won't want to come back!
2,Microsoft Office Home & Student 2007,"I couldn't understand why the microsoft program would not give me access, but I realized my trial period had ended. So after learning this is what is needed for the program to work, I ordered it and I'm not computer savvy and I was able to follow the instructions with no problems."
2,JIM CARREY Is Andy Kaufman,"MAN ON THE MOON is a great movie for any Jim Carrey and Andy Kaufman fan.The film follows the story of Andy Kaufman from when he was a child (putting on TV skits in his room) to when he is struggling to become a great ""song-and-dance man"" comedian.The actors in this film gave great performances, and the enigma mystery in this film is when is Andy Kaufman staging something and when is Andy Kaufman being totally honest?"
2,"Good sound, could be more comfy","These headphones have a lot of benefits; they sound very good, with decent bass and nice open-air sound. They're lightweight, and contrary to some other reviews, I found them easy to fold up once I did it a few times. Only real downside I found is the the earpads are a little rough, and the 2 small cushions on the headband kind of poke your head, so I'd call the comfort passable. I'd buy them again, as the comfort issue isn't that big a deal."
1,Not comfortable using it,"Please see my review of the ThermaCELL MR-1C on why I decided not to use this product after I did some research on the synthetic chemical they use.....and, why I now use simple household, white distilled vinegar instead! Works 100% effective so far!"
1,Foot fell off in 3 days,Do not buy this garbage or any targus tripod for that matter! They always fall apart in at most a week! I had three different ones and they always fall apart.
1,TAPE WAS BROKEN,UNABLE TO VIEW DUE TO BROKEN TAPE. THIS IS THE SECOND VHS THAT I HAVE ORDERED. THE FIRST ONE NEVER GOT HERE AND THE SECOND WAS BROKEN.
2,Highly recommended,"This is the first serious and interesting history I have read about the modern American political system. The author (historian) looked at a zillion archives and put together a breathtaking overview of how congress changed so much since the New Deal period.The book is filled with good stories, like Hubert Humphrey pissing off southern colleagues when he comes to the Senate and this guy Richard Bolling whose reforms go down in flames. I also learned lots about why liberals lost out to conservatives on Capitol Hill.I highly recommend this."
2,Good little gadget,"I bought these as stocking stuffers because they are good to have. My sister saw me using it and thought is was useful, needless to say she found on in her stocking"
1,Beware! You want the Import CD.,"Just a word of warning here...Take a look at the track list. A mere 11 tracks comprise this release.The Import version is the one you want, that has over 20 tracks, making this release irrelevant."
2,Pure blissful entertainment,This is a disc I have owned for years and still enjoy immensely.The program is nicely varied and the playing is as expert as one could wish for. There is a pleasing sense of a shared joy in the playing.The recording is excellent and it is inconceivable that this would not be enjoyed by any future purchaser.There was a follow-up disc called 'Together Again' which is equally enjoyable and now there is the option to buy both collections packaged together. For newcomers this may be the best buy.
1,Not as good as the old one...,definitely not as sturdy as the one i had when i was a kid. this one broke as we were putting it away in the box after using it for the first time on christmas morning. it seems really cheap. think i'll give my old one to the kids instead since it's held up better than the new one.
2,After too long a wait...,"...I finally purchased this album, and have enjoyed it both as ambient soundtrack at home and ""driving music"" on the road."
1,Do not waste your time!,"This movie was terrible. Everyone on this board who gave this film a positive review must have been paid by the makers or involved in the movie somehow. I rented this film with very low expectations. It being such a low budget film, I only anticipated a good story...... but was disappointed. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible. The effects are terrible.The biggest disappointment was the story. I get ignore everything else if the story at least made sense. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! I rented it for $1 and I want the time I wasted watching it more than the money!"
2,Not quite Old Spaghetti Factory,"I bought this to try to make the Old Spaghetti Factory Myzithra browned butter a la Homer which is my favorite. Ok I'm not a pro chef, but I think I did pretty well but it still did not quite taste as delicious as the restaurant. I'm sticking with the restaurant!"
2,Great for your kids first big bed,"We were finally ready to move our son to his own room complete with daybed. Our son was still being potty trained so we looked for a way to protect the bed for the inevitable night time accidents from a leaky diaper.This cover is the perfect solution, waterproof but very comfortable to lay on - you don't hear the plastic at all.One recommendation, make sure you let it hang for a day or two to let it air out (leftover factory smell) before using.One last kudo on this is that it's made by Beautyrest so you can buy with confidence. A+++++++++"
2,TO INFINITY AND BEYOND,"THIS ALBUM WILL BLOW YOUR KILT UP! YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD SONGS THIS POWERFUL! VERY MOVING HEARTFELT LYRICS ABOUT THEIR COUNTRY AND CULTURE. THIS IS A MUST HAVE IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAT NOTHING ELSE OUT THERE IS IN THE SAME STYLISTIC CATEGORY. THEY LITERALLY BANG THIS MUSIC OUT ON THE ""CROSSING"""
2,This series is a work of Art!!,"Yes, let me say it again-short and sweet-unlike all the other reviewers who write pages and pages- This series -from start to finish- is a Work of Art! Own it!"
2,Nice for the price,"Love these bags, very inexpensive and does the job just as well as the more expensive ones I've always purchased. Will purchase these again and actually need to. I'd say purchase, decorate and enjoy........."
2,Great Read!,I enjoyed this take on life (and death) afer menopause. Bel Barret solves a tough puzzle and her family and friends seem a lot like mine - so I get a kick out of them. I learned a lot about the NJ Meadowlands too!
2,Good product,I carry one in the poncho pouch attached to my gadget bag shoulder strap and another in my wife's. Very handy and easy to use.
2,Can you say DRAMA...,"I love this show SOOO much! I loved all of the drama between LC and Kristin, all of the parties, and the beach. And I thought Kristin & Stephan were so cute together. On the graduation I cried. I think Stephan is EXTREMLY hot!"
1,second rate 70's progressive pop,"Alan Parson's project efforts make clear the reality that a talented producer does not necessarily have the ability to create music of his own that is of any great value or lasting interest. This is a dull, ininspired, unimaginative attempt at progressive-pop. Later efforts prove equally inept. Skip this artist all together and go for the real thing...Simon"
1,Won't induce vomiting.,This product is not real ipecac. It is a homeopathic placebo and will not induce vomiting.
2,Heart Warming Story,"I liked this book. It was good, but a little upseting in someparts. It was truthful and honest. I can see these children and how hard it must be for them. They're isolated and people are so ignorant, I think that that is tragic. Our society is too ignorant.Its amazing how this teacher is really dedicated to this cause and really wants to teach these kids. Its totally awesome how she can relate to them. Shiela is really troubled and she's really difficult. You can see from the beginning that she is stubborn and it would be difficult to deal with her, but Torey does a wonderful job at getting through and dealing with her. ITs just really heartwarming wathing their relationship grow. Its just really nice to see this girl who seems like a devil on the outside open up and reveal her little self. She has dealt with really grown up issues and its really damaging, but she tries really hard to deal with it, and be normal. This is just really heartwarming and inspiring!"
2,Great album!,"This is the best Clawfinger has released since Deaf Dumb. The album is more hip hop than Clawfinger used to be but it sounds great. I have no idea why this hasn't been a great hit. It surely has the potential. If you like nu-metal or hip hop, buy this album!"
2,An important learning experience on the system of slavery.,"This novel portrays the unjust and cruel accounts of slavery through the lives of some very unique characters. The reader goes through some vauable life experiences with each one of the characters to see how slavery affects them personally. By doing this,Stowe, makes the reader aware of the effects that slavery can have ona human race dealing with the themes of family seperation,motherhood, religion and social cruelty. This easy-read novel provides a valuable learning experience for the reader on the instituion of slavery. I would recommend it to students from ninth grade up to adults who are willing to become educated in a vivid way on this topic."
2,good video,"I like this video enough, though it is on the dull side.This isn't any cardio so if someone is looking for that, then this is the wrong video!The ab section while good, made me feel really sick. I've had that happen before when I focus on abs so I won't blame this video for that.This is a great video for the arms and thighs in particular"
1,Extra features don't play,"The video transfer is great and the audio is outstanding. BUT... none of the extra features are available on my LG Blu-ray player. The movie automatically starts playing and there is no way to access the menu. This is particularly dissappointing because I was looking forward to the audio commentary, which isn't offered on the DVD version."
1,Another free downloader....,"I give this cd two stars for two decent tracks, and that is being generous. These guys should have stuck to releasing the occasional single. ... Why buy this retro rehash when you can still find the originals they are trying so hard to emulate? Please check out L.F.O.'s ""Frequencies"", or 808 States' ""Utd. State 90"" before spending your hard earned cash on this one."
2,One of those things you have to know,One needs the Rules to make it through large meetings. This book presents them in readable form.
2,Spectacular,"For anyone who loves Washington, D.C. this book is not to be missed. The photographs are unique and show familiar locations in unusual delightful perspectives. For those who have not been to the nation's capital it will surely whet the desire to make the trip. It makes a wonderful gift which can be appreciated for many years."
1,,None the palace of pleasure volume l is not worth the time it takes to download it and then delete it.
1,Terrible Turntable,"This turntable is extremely unreliable and a waste of money. I wanted to get a turntable that played 78s as well as 33s, and thought that this would be a nice choice. I had previously owned a Garard 42M for 30 years, but it only played 33s and occasionally had wow, so I thought this would last for another generation.About a year after I bought it, the player stopped working, and after many attempts to get it going over several days, it began to play at a speed that was so slow that the sound was horribly distorted. Now it does not play at all. It is not the belt, but to repair it now would cost more than it is worth, and who knows how long it would work after the repair? I think I am going to go back to my Garard or try another old turntable."
2,Relationship Relay...,"There are a couple of really strong relationships going on in this book. Tenel Ka and Jacen (Naw Durr.) and, even if they don't know it, Zekk and Jaina. Tenel Ka starts to relize that she likes Jacen after he cut off her arm, and Jacen has already felt that way towards her. And Jacen is really scared that Tenel Ka will hate him for the accident he thinks he caused, when they both had equal measures of blame. And Jaina and Zekk's thoughts continually swirl around each other, moreso Zekk than little ms independent. Jaina and I are a lot alike, so I have an easier time seeing things in the story from her point of view. Which is probably why I liked 'Dark Journey' in the NJO series so much. Anyway, READ THIS BOOK!"
2,"Very fun, but not the best Carlton Mellick book","This book is full of ideas and creative situations. It is funny and odd. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It reminds me of William Burroughs, Kurt Vonnegut, Chuck Palahniuk, Anthony Burgess, Steve Aylett, or any off-the-wall author you might think of. But this is not Mellick's best book. I personally like his novellas better. They are short, illustrated, and much more surreal. Though Satan Burger is the best ""punk"" novel I've ever read. It is about a group of punks who live in a world filled with strange races such as midget clones of American presidents, drunken knights, blue women, and violent sex-crazed lizard people. There's also a thing about God closing the gates of Heaven and Satan running a fast food restaurant. I recommend this to anyone who likes Vonnegut or Douglas Adams and happens to be a fan of punk, death metal, goth, or any alternative culture."
1,Horrible headphones,These ear plugs are awful. I had a pair of sony funtopia headphones that broke so I decided to try these. The sound is so colored they are imposible to listen to without heavy EQ. The bass is muddy and overpowering. After a few weeks of light use the in line mute button has started to cut out so I have to wiggle the wire to get both channels. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for a pair of these. They are absolutely terrible.
2,Very Good but where's the countdown?,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer that this cd is great but it's missing Jericho's countdown. Not putting the millenium countdown in Jericho's theme is like not putting the bells in the Undertaker's theme! The Austin song is pathetic and i REALLY hope he doesn't have that as his new theme music as that would completely defeat the purpose of Stone Cold Steve Austin. Other than that the cd is good, IF YA SMELLLLALALALA WHAT THE ROCK............IS COOKIN!"
2,Super Book,This is just an amazing reference with everything one would need to know on the topic. Excellent illustration round out this work.
1,Some beautiful close-ups,There are some beautiful close-ups of a few planes. And unfortunally that's all. No full description and it's not a guide.
2,Good-looking Fan,"The reason I gave this a 4 stars was just because this fan's power was not as strong as i expected from it's series. However, we loved the padded handle on top for ease of moving the fan around. It's sturdy and very quiet."
1,Careful - doesn't work with latex...,"The box doesn't say it does latex (""Stains, sealers, enamels""), so technically, Wagner isn't a total sleeze. Of course, when I walk the paint aisles of HD or Lowes, 90% of the paints are latex, so its an easy mistake to make. It's possible to get it to spray latex, but its slow and spatters a lot.Come on Wagner, be more forthcoming - put a big warning on the box ""NOT FOR LATEX PAINT.""One more return for you...."
2,Metroid Prime,"At first, I won't deny I was a little disappointed that Metroid was going to the 1st person shooter format (like GOLDENEYE) but after I played the game, I quickly changed my mind. METROID PRIME is easily game of the year! It's totally awesome! The graphics and gameplay are great and all together, I had a lot of fun playing this one.In my opinion, now that it's not a scroller and now a shooter, it's a lot more combat and kick butt orientated. Seriously, it takes a few minutes to get used to it, but after that initial maybe 3 - 5 minutes, you're golden and you won't be disappointed.In any case, this is a great game! You have to pick this one up, whether you're into shooters, adventures or simply a fan of the Metroid series. Get this game and also, check out RESIDENT EVIL 0. Another great title for the Gamecube."
1,Gone Soft,"Yes, the CD may have some good lyrics; yes, some songs may be catchy, but I remember Third Eye Blind as a band that rocked. I was thoroughly disappointed to find a CD lacking in anything resembling a good straight up rock song, such as 1000 Julys or Narcolepsy. Buy this CD if you're more a fan of the introspective, ""deep"" Third Eye Blind, but don't expect any songs you can drive to."
2,Great for a Yoga practice,I'm a Yoga teacher always in search of new music for my classes. I had seen this CD during my training and decided to give it a try. It's appropriately upbeat and at the same time a lovely spin on Kirtan. I totally recommend it for those practitioners who practice a Vinyasa-Flow style of yoga.
1,These sucks!,I thought the shoes were adorable but one broke the first day I used them. Major bummer!!!
2,The Harvey Girls -- dvd,The dvd is wonderful... I have enjoyed watching the movie. Thanks for having the dvd on Amazon.
2,Very Good Price,"Much better price than dept stores. Hassle free, easy to order, comes right to your door. I would have given 5 STARS if an unnecessary tote bag came with it.......just a joke. I would definitely re-order from same vendor when I run out."
2,I see dead people...,"This is by far, the best movie I have ever seen. The acting was great, and the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat. The whole plot was exellent, and the ending was amazing! This movie is a must-see for anybody!"
2,"Stylish, Rugged, and Inexpensive","So I've worn this watch for about 6 months now, so I have a pretty good idea of its capabilities and limitations.PROS: It looks great (minus the band). Obviously it's going to be rugged since it's a G-Shock. The hour and minute hands stand out well against the black background. While the hands get in the way of the digital information, it's only slightly and you can still make out all the details. The back-light is ample. It strikes a good balance between displaying information and not blinding you.CONS: Setting the analog hands is cumbersome, but not impossible. It just takes some time and patience. The band has an alligator-type pattern on it, which I do NOT like. They should have continued the resin material down to the clasp from the bezel. I deduct one style point from the star rating because of the band. It's borderline tacky."
1,Atomic Crap,"These guys suck. I used to think that any number of cheesy 80's metal bands were the inspiration for Spinal Tap, but Atomic Rooster predated them all. Don't waste your money on this garbage - if you're looking for some good, relatively obscure blues based rock, go dig up some Blue Cheer albums."
2,A Gift for the Dawning Age...,Kudos to all who contributed to this unique and informative volume of information!!!Certainly a treasure to be discovered by all!!
2,perfect Christmas gift,"My boyfriend loved it as a Christmas gift, and I've actually been enjoying watching the discs with him. The series was very well done."
1,This overly sentimental movie destroys Steinbeck's work.,"This movie is overly sentimental and completely destroys the content and meaning of Steinbeck's original novel. The most poignant parts of Steinbecks novels are altered in such a way to meet the demands of a Forties audience. The novel ends with Danny's death in a mythological assault on the gods. The movie ends with Danny's marrying Sweets Ramirez and living happily ever after. In the novel, the corporal's baby dies. There is a lesson in that chapter about proper child rearing. In the movie, Danny and Sweets adopt the baby and it too lives happily ever after. This is a story that's about due to be made into a movie that more closely follows the story and meaning of the book."
2,Good Clock/Radio but needs some more things.,This GE Telephone it a good thing for people who don't want to wake up at the same time but overall this is a great gift and it overall good. I have never had any problems with GE and love there stuff. The only thing about this is it don't have the greatest sound like my other GE Radio/Clock. They could inhance the sound a little bit. Another thing is there are a lot of buttons that are confusing when you are just waking up. I also push the wrong button when I want to push snoose. But overall this is a great phone and the phone itself it clear and I mean clear. So this is definetly a buyer choice.
2,The Best of 98 Degrees CD-Excellent!,I really enjoy The Best of 98 Degrees Christmas Collection CD. It's peppy music and fun to listen to.
2,Myst sequel didn't quite live up to expectations,"I have loved, played, and collected the Myst games for years, but Myst Revelation was slightly disappointing. I didn't get as absorbed into the story line as much. The game is still fun, and just as challenging, with beautiful graphics, I just enjoyed the previous ones better. If you are planning on buying it, please do!! Just don't expect as much as the first 3 previous Myst games."
2,Refreshing and New,"I found this book to be a complete delight, a pleasure cruise of helpful hints to guide me through the bumps in the road of life. If you find yourself stopped in life or life just isn't what it used to be, or you just want to have more fun in life, then this book is for you! I AM DIVA!"
2,Leonardo da Vinci: the Universal Genius,"Written for the young adult, this well illustrated book is written in an engaging and easy to read story style biography. Noble often traveled extensively for research and the book is filled with black and white facsimiles of the master's works. A bibliography is included that can be used for further study along with a 'location of major works' although it may no longer be current. The book is indexed with people, places events and works, a great reference tool."
1,Not what I ordered,"I received a book titled ""Snakes!"", unfortunately, not the one pictured which is the one I wanted. I have since then returned the book with no feedback as to whether or not I'll be receiving another."
2,that squeak ender.,"I had a ranch in atlanta that had squeaks in it. so, I went to my lowe's store and got squeakender. They really do work. I went backto get some more, and they didn't have anymore. Ive since moved to boston and had the same problem. so, I went to the home depot and they didn't have any. I am glad you guys do."
2,My Man Pendleton,"Really enjoyed this book. Good plot, sexy and humorous. Well written and not too many typos in my Kindle version. That means a lot to me! Can't wait to read more books by this author!"
1,Horrible quality,You will feel ashamed if you spend your money on these incredibly poor quality tapes. The average rating for these tapes should be one star if you read the reviewers' commentary. Wait until someone finally releases a decent copy (preferably on DVD).
2,A serious and original book!,"Ruse's book is an exciting journey along the interface between science and religion. Although one might say that it's title should be ""How can a darwinian be a christian?"", the book does deal very seriously with the relationship between science and religion, and does thet in an original way. As a student of both philosophy of religion and life sciences I found that Ruse presents both sides' arguments very clearly and without distorting them at all (which isn't usualy easy to do). And as for the question of taking the biblical story literaly (which a few of the reviewers here thought as a must and as a destruction of Ruse's ideas) , it was the great jewish philosopher Meimonides who said that it (the story told in Genesis I 1-11) is only a story which should be interpreted according to science."
2,Love the feel,Very comfy and true to fit. They don't take up room in your suitcase and feel great as P.J.s too.
2,worth the price.,"It is not bad if you just need a steamer for your dresses, and it's perfect for temporary use like me. But if you want to keep a long lasting one at home, you'd better spend more money and choose a better one~ this is not that good when using, but I should say, what do you expect from a $25 steamer?~ it's farely good, especially for the price."
2,Excellent absorbency and best price ever!,"These work great. They are narrow and short, but work really well. If more coverage is needed I just use two. This is by far the best price I have ever seen on them with the subscribe program. I only use natural care products since the others have chemicals in them that have been linked to cancers. I recommend these to any one who wants to keep the chemicals out!"
1,ok,"its hard to use and doesnt look like the picture. it needs a flat surface but it does work, hopefully it doesnt drain batteries too fast"
2,One of my favorites,"My biggest problem was it wouldn't work in my DVD player hooked to the TV, but it would work in my little portable one so I'm happy."
2,Pretty Good,"Let me say that out of all of today's bands, Ingram Hill is one of the better ones. Just the other day, I heard ""Will I Ever Make It Home"" on the radio, and that song alone was enough to make me buy this CD. The hilights on this album are:ChicagoNever Be The SameAlmost PerfectOn My WayWill I Ever Make It HomeWhat If I'm RightIf I had to point out any flaws that I see on the album, I would basically say that on some songs, the 'balance' is kind of off. In other words, all of the instruments kind of seem like they're fighting to be louder than the others. But that doesn't really bother me that much.Anyway, if you haven't gotten out of your seat and bought this album yet, DO IT!"
1,Ignorance & Prejudice,"This anti-Catholic screed is based on raw ignorance. The Catholic Church permits many other kinds of natural family planning than the rhythm method. The Pontifical Biblical commission never voted in favor of women's ordination. The anecdotal ""incidents"" cited by Manning are suspect. The alleged speakers (no documentation provided) all speak in Manning's distinctive voice.Please be forewarned: Joanna Manning is an ex-Catholic who is a member of Catholics for a Free Choice and other anti-Catholic orgranizations."
1,Great movie on bad DVD,"I have always loved this movie. No discussion possible.But... this DVD is about as bad as it gets: it is a FAKE wide-screen reproduction, meaning that on a wide-screen TV you get black bars all around the image. Yes, you can zoom in, using your TV's zoom function bad that means that are blowing up the pixels even further (already pixels are expanded to show regular DVDs on high-res screens, zooming makes it even worse.Anamorphic wide-screen has been available in the DVD definition from the get go. This technique gives best wide-screen reproduction on full-screen AND wide-screen TV sets."
1,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though not as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, Anchorman excels only in proving that people find stupidity funny for its own sake; the movie's appeal stems largely from lines like ""I love lamp"" which have no inherent humor value unless one is a 12-22 year-old male."
1,Be careful to inspect the cable type before you buy!,This is NOT the cable you think it is! Make sure to get a closer view of what the ends of this cable look like. The differences are very subtle.
2,A GOOD EDUCATIONAL FILM,"This video is vital for anyone who is dating and wants to get married somewhere down the road. I like the fact that it points out to similarity and compatibility when choosing a partner. If there are conflicts, they have to be worked out prior to walking down the aisle. The points in this film stand out and they are sound."
1,Make sure it set up properly.,"I had this last week and was very excited to show up at the back yard under morning sun. Unfortunately, one screw was broken anyhow and I didn't notice. It is just fine. After two to three times on/off, and turn back on the chair I was amazingly falling down to the deck floor like slippery on the ice. That is it.Now, it is working fine and lovely. But the back is still in pain."
2,I LOVE THESE CASES!!!!,"these cases are amazing!! i love them!! if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy Memorex DVD Storage Cases. there the next best thing, i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds.thanks Memorex!!"
2,its an okay movie,well i saw this movie a long time ago and i dont remember laughing at any parts of the movie i only remember watching small parts of the movie and i kind of liked this movie this movie i belive only has action but no comedy its not the greatest movie ever but its not bad eaither just give this movie a try!!!
2,A Christmas Book That is Different From the Others,"I started reading this book to my now-seven year-old daughter two years ago. Clueless about the plot, I read on and on; by the end we were both sniffling away the tears. Jonathan Toomey has since become de rigeur holiday reading in our family. I think we like it so much not least because it seamlessly combines the religious message of Christmas with a very down-to-earth story about love, loss, and love - again. Also, the illustrations are pretty extraordinary. My only suggestion: The author and illustrator should immediately publish a dozen books like it!"
2,Must Have for any Anime Fan!,Just one of the best breakthrough series ever released in Japan and America.
1,A Great Disappointment,"After looking forward to this recording with much fervor, I was very disappointed to hear the final result. The sound quality throughout is poor (the mike shorts out during Lou Reed's ""Berlin,"" for which the liner notes apoligize), but other tracks are muddy, too, especially the encore, ""All Tomorrow's Parties,"" which is further ruined by the voice of a woman offstage taking during the performance. Also, Nico suffers from an embarrasingly long coughing fit after she finishes ""Janitor of Lunacy."" Each of the trio have about one good song each (""Waiting for the Man,"" ""Ghost Story,"" and ""Femme Fatale""). The two ""Bonus Tracks"" are an insult to the consumer, just throwaway pieces that are not even complete songs, badly recorded. Even the die hard Velvet Underground fans should be wary of this one. The letdown of the year, and it's only Februrary!"
2,Oddball Florida,"We as snowbirds travel to florida each winter, this books is full of info of places we visited that now after reading it, we must revisit some of those places. ""Great Book full of info""DWS"
2,full tracks,1. El Tilingo Lingo~~~2. Camino de San Cristobal~~~3. Las Copetonas~~~4. Chiapas~~~5. La Negra~~~6. La Tortuga del Arenal~~~7. El Zopilote Mojado~~~8. El Pajaro Cu~~~9. Las Coronelas~~~10. El Ahuelulco.
2,A breakthrough for relationships,"After reading this book, I finally got a good grasp on the why and how of relating to others. Brian Weiss's account of reincarnation is extremely inspiring, revealing and honest. The good thing is, he doesn't care whether you believe the events he describes or not. There's nothing to verify anyway, but I just knew deep inside that it was all true. My life is changed forever, for the better!"
1,A waste of money,Bought this product and sending it back the same day. It failed to sharpen any of my knives no matter how much time was spent using the device. The motor was so weak that it would stop under the weight of a chef's knife without and downward pressure.
2,Its a message of the ages,"I found this gift of a book while I was browsing in a small shop in Alaska. It's a book that is definitely one to be kept in one's own library to remind ourselves each and every day of the gifts that we have as individuals to share with the world. I believe that there is so much negativity in our every day lives and a book such as this gives us back our humanity to us. As someone said we think we are human beings trying to be spiritual when in fact we are spiritual beings trying to be human. So for all of those who have low self esteem and think they have nothing to give others, read this book, it is a must! And for those who know they have gifts to offer someone, read this book, for it puts into such simple words how simple it is to be wonderful each and every day! Thank you to the author for having the strength and joy in her heart to put forth loving words of inspiration! I am a true fan!"
1,never in this lifetime,"Jennifer Lopez is a good actress, although she's not great, and singing sure isn't her thing. She has absolutly no voice range. If you are going to be a singer you should truly be able to sing in more than one octave. Besides, her dancing isn't all that great either. Next time she has a chance to sing live she should think before acting! Thank god for those backup singers!"
2,WIlber's most comprehensive work,"There is no need to rehash the brilliance of Ken Wilber. I think this is Wilber's most comprehensive work to date. It is very detailed and he covers an incredible range of topics. You do need to have some background knowledge in History, Literature, Social Sciences, Religion, and Philosophy to grasp this material adequately but if you do, it will truly inspire you and also make you truly think. If you don't have that kind of background knowledge I'd recommend ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato since it covers similar ground but Sato's work is more simplified and requires minimal background knowledge."
1,a waste of time and money.,"Not only was this book an insult to my intelligence, it was full of the most awful stereotyping. The Mexican character Maria is a caricature of a human, something that's not done to any of the other characters in the novel.Some of my favorite moments come when Melanie refers to Asia as ""that backward continent with weird picture letters,"" and when one boy tells another boy that the only reason people think women like Penelope Cruz and Selma Hayek are hot is because ""it's p.c.""The authors must have hired a P.R. firm to salvage their star rating because there is no way this tripe is worthy of three stars.Don't waste your money on this drivel. Seriously."
1,Inaccurate and always needs to be reset.,"If I could return this for a refund I would. Constantly needs to be reset. Off in temp readings by 5-10 degrees, monitor is impossible to place when live in apt on 3rd floor, reads as raining when it is not all the time. I work outdoors and bought this because I desperately need accurate weather readings. This does not meet my needs, and it is a waste of money. I would like the manufacturer to give me a 100% refund. By the time I realized it was so inaccurate, I could not get my refund through Amazon."
2,Very Inspiring,"The world is a better place because of the dedication of these Nuns. The film really conveys the ultimate reason for their Buddhist Practice. Their faces, the scenery and the music is compelling and inspiring."
2,"Great voice, great sound, great cd","I think this is a great album. It is very well put together and has a good feel to it. It isn't like a lot of the more super-peppy, generic music being spit out right now. It has a good mix of upbeatness and mellowness. The songs have a nice variety of sounds to them and allow the listener to stay interested even though the lead singers voice does not have much range. I like it and listen often."
1,Poorly made!!,"I purchased this coffeemaker about a year ago. Although it's a little cumbersome, it got the job done. I have used it almost daily. One month ago, a small piece of the grinder cover broke, thus rendering the entire appliance non-functional. Yes, that's right, even if you don't want to use the grinder, the coffee maker WILL NOT FUNCTION without that piece. So I ordered another one for $10.00 from Cuisinart.com, asked for quick shipping, and waited. After multiple phone calls to them (no correspondence from their end) I have learned that the part is ""backordered,"" that many people are waiting for it (another sign that it's poorly made) and that it might be more than another month before I see that piece. Meanwhile, the thing is collecting dust. I have tried to get refunded the price of the coffeemaker, but it's ""out of warranty"" so I'm ""out of luck."" So my recommendation to anyone considering this appliance is look elsewhere. I would NOT buy another Cuisinart if my life depended on it."
1,Not worth it in the long run,"For the price this is a good toaster, but after a year we went from having it set on 4-5 to 7-8 all the time. It toasts uneven, and inconsistently. The light for the numbered setting indicator flickers. If you need something cheap, go for it, but if you want something that will last a while get something that is better made."
1,Probably Not a Complete Waste,"The author wrote this with the underlying belief that not every way of hitting a piano key will produce the same sound. I can't subscribe to that, because at the end of the chain of events that produces a note, the sound is caused by a hammer hitting the string(s). Whether you hit that key with ""the fleshy part of your finger"", your fist or a waffle iron, it's still just hammers striking strings.When the author isn't going on and on about the theatrics of your wrist and arm motion to better hit a key so as to let him think you're producing a different tone, the rest of this book can actually be of some help to some pianists and wannabes."
1,NO BONDS !!! NO TAGGING RUNNERS Etc.,"Unfortunately, this game is critically flawed. Basic baseball things can't be done. No check swings or wild pitches. I had a game in 1992 call Hardball II that could do these things. And it was on a single floppy. Can't tag a runner on a base line. If you want to switch positions of players while in the game... something that is done often in the real MLB to accomadate a change, is not possible. These are basic baseball realities that any descent game should have.No Barry Bonds!!!!! C'mon! Weather you like the guy or not, he is the MOST important player of our time. It is misleading to sell a game and call it MLB and not have its premeir player. That's wrong.The only neat feature is the career mode but even that could use some work.The eye toy is a silly gimmick that doesn't really add to the game. They should test these games before they release them."
2,My all-time favorite book!,"I don't know who to thank for bringing this back into publication, but I can thank Amazon from the bottom of my heart for making it available! Truth is, I was close to buying an old, tattered copy on ebay for $75 or more, just to own a copy of this book. And now I have my very own brand new, crisp, clean copy - all mine! Whenever I want! I read a copy years ago, and I've borrowed it from my local library several times over the years, but it was just never enough. This brilliant story of a woman who writes a book about the people in her town to make an income, which results in stirring up trouble from the town's inhabitants, is a delight from start to finish. Very easy to read, very light hearted and funny. And this edition is such a nice, sturdy softcover with a dust cover over it! I am so pleased, I just can't wait to delve into it! Couldn't be more pleased."
1,Terribly Frustrating,"Vista came on my new computer and a dark day it was. I should have replaced the bad hard drive on the old one and loaded XP. Five days straight and I have had to 1.purchase new printer 2. purchase new Office Suite 3. purchase new Norton even though I renewed in September. 4. purchase new Quickbooks 5. Probably have to replace my scanner since Microsoft says it is incompatable. Family Treemaker does not work. Buy a $600 computer and get to spend another $1500 on programs and equipment. WHAT A DEAL!! No wonder Gates has billions, he makes it on slick deals like this. R.E.T."
2,A very entertaining film,"While ""The Saint"" isn't precisely an epic film that everyone should see, but it's really fun and keeps my attention and interest each time I watch it. Val Kilmer displays his innate gift for accents and for a chameleon-like ability to change his personality traits. Elisabeth Shue, of whom I've never been fond, is also enjoyable in her role, largely due to her brimming and infectious enthusiasm for her work. This isn't a Must-See Movie, but it's sure to be enjoyable for anyone who likes action movies."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"From the amount of money I spent on this thing I was extremly disappointed. First of all, it won't let you copy any real movies-it will eject the tape and say ""tape is copy protected"".This is the main reason I bought the thing. Second of all, the #2 tape deck became contaminated and just showed wavy lines. I tried a head-cleaner tape but it didn't help one bit. No matter how I ajusted the tracking it wouldn't work. This occured just 3 months after purchase. BUYER BEWARE!"
1,Not the best on this subject,"I first read this book a few years ago and then again recently. While it is written in an easy way and is a quick read I find that Cahill is not good at presenting recent scholarship or indeed in backing up what he is saying with references. Some of his ""facts"" are actually mythology but he does not state this and there is no clear line between actual Irish history and myth. In this he does a disservice to Irish scholars. I recommend that readers also read ""In Search of Ancient Ireland"" the more recent publication that gives a better overview of the same period in Irish history and with greater clarity and detail."
